The economic cost might become uncontrollable if radical policy changes are not implemented soon. Particulate matter emission is mostly attributed to road transport and power generation worldwide. This paper examines the state and adequacy of fuel and vehicle standards prevalent across the African continent. Experimental emissions tests were conducted on 200 vehicles each in Rwanda and Ghana to ascertain compliance to local and international standards. The result showed that even some new vehicles failed the emission tests while almost all the diesel cars tested in both countries failed the international standard. It was discovered that only five African countries have emission standards, most of which were not being implemented. The results also show that while there are approximately 72 million vehicles in use in Africa, only seven countries are responsible for 70% of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation in Africa is growing at a rate of 7% annually. Poor fuel quality, aging vehicle fleet, and lack of mandatory roadworthy emission tests were to blame for the deteriorating transport emissions. More than 50% of African countries have fuel quality worse than European fuel quality predating 1992. The study recommended the UK's emission standard for the annual in-service emission testing and Euro 4 standards for both fuel and new vehicle standards. © 2021 The Author(s)","Africa; Emissions; Fuel standard; Roadworthiness; Vehicle standard; Vehicles in use",,"Ayetor, G.K.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Ghana; эл. почта: gkkayetor@knust.edu.gh",,"Elsevier Ltd",25901982,,,,"English","Transp.

Commonly used biotrickling filters may cause biogas dilution or generation of explosive mixtures. Compared with biotrickling filters, two-step process such as bioscrubber filters can overcome these shortages. However, its removal efficiency was still limited due to low microbial activity under high pH condition. Here, a bioreactor filter was carried out under pH 9.0. Removal efficiency higher than 99% was achieved under sulfide loading rate reaching 4.24 kg S m−3d−1. Results of network and high throughput sequencing showed that Thiobacillus acted as both dominant species (accounting for 75%) and unique kinless hub in this bioreactor. Other bacteria (accounting for 25%) contributed 75% to the network, which implied the intensive interaction between Thiobacillus and others. Sulfide removal ability and pH tolerance of pure bacteria and mixed culture were considered to verify how microbial interaction influenced them. Compared with pure bacteria, mixed culture had better performance under high pH condition, which confirmed that microbial interaction promoted desulfurization efficiency under high pH condition. These results showed that intensive microbial interaction might be the key to enhance sulfide removal efficiency under high pH condition. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Aggregates; Biogas desulfurization; Microbial interaction; Network","sulfide; Article; desulfurization; DNA extraction; electron microscopy; high throughput sequencing; inoculation; microbial interaction; mixed cell culture; nonhuman; oxidation; particle size; pH; reactor operation; sludge; Thiobacillus; Thiobacillus","Hu, B.; Department of Environmental Engineering, China; эл. почта: blhu@zju.edu.cn",,"Academic Press Inc.",00139351,,ENVRA,"34118244","English","Environ.

The research on the coordinated development of pollutant and carbon emission reduction in transport industry is helpful to the realization of urban pollutant prevention and carbon emission reduction, especially in big cities. Thus, a multi-period bottom-up vehicle development mathematical model is proposed to analyze the technology development path, emission path and energy structure adjustment path, and the synergistic benefits of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction under a expected air pollution emission standard. Four pollutants, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM), generated from the vehicle are considered in this model. Then, the proposed model is used to analyze the related vehicle structure and energy consumption under the expected emission standards for Beijing during 2020 and 2035. The technology development path, emission path and energy structure adjustment path are examined, and the synergistic benefits of CO2 emission reduction are also studied. Some important implication are found as follows: (1) Even with the goal of environmental pollution control only, new energy vehicles will have an explosive growth period, starting from about 2025. (2) Strict air pollution emission policies do not always lead to the rapid development of new energy vehicles before 2025. (3) The four main pollutants show different levels of synergistic effect among which CO on HC and NOx on PM are obvious, respectively. (4) Even under the control of the air pollution policy, the synergistic effect to CO2 emission reduction is also obvious. Compared to the baseline case, the reduction benefit from the MILD and STRICT environmental policies are 30 and 70 million yuan, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution control policy; Bottom-up optimization model; Carbon co-benefit; Urban development plan","carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; China; energy consumption; environmental factor; environmental management; environmental policy; human; motor vehicle; particulate matter; process technology; structure analysis; traffic and transport; urban area","Zhu, K.; University of Chinese Academy of SciencesChina; эл. почта: zhukaiwei18@mails.ucas.edu.cn",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"33940404","English","Sci.

The China IV LDVs containing 4 gasoline vehicles (GVs) and 4 natural gas vehicles (NGVs) had port fuel injection (PFI) engines, while the China V LDVs included 2 GVs with PFI engines and 2 GVs with gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines. The average EFs of PM2.5 were 1.90 ± 0.70 mg km−1, 1.44 ± 0.29 mg km−1, and 0.56 ± 0.05 mg km−1 for China IV GVs, China IV NGVs, and China V GVs, respectively. PM2.5 profiles of LDVs were characterized by abundant carbon species (60.59–68.58%) with low amounts of water soluble ions (WSIs, 6.96–16.37%) and elements (5.20–7.53%). In general, the EFs of PM2.5 constituents including organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), WSIs, and elements were reduced obviously by strengthening emission standards from China IV to China V. While the contributions of most WSIs and elements to PM2.5 increased as vehicle technology improved. Furthermore, the EFs of PM2.5 components from China IV LDVs also decreased when shifting fuels from gasoline to natural gas. While the fractions of OC, WSIs and most elements in PM2.5 increased due to the highest reduction rate of EC mass. For China V LDVs, GDI vehicles emitted less OC but more EC compared to PFI vehicles, and the EFs of most WSIs and elements also increased. Overall, GDI vehicles exhibited lower fractions OC and WSIs but higher contents of EC and elements in PM2.5. Besides, PM2.5 and its chemical species were heavily dependent on vehicle's driving patterns. The average EFs of PM2.5 components under aggressive driving pattern increased significantly compared to those under moderate driving pattern. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Chassis dynamometer; Emission factor; PM2.5; Source profile; Vehicle exhaust","Direct injection; Engines; Gasoline; Natural gas; Organic carbon; Chassis dynamometers; Driving pattern; Elemental carbon; Emission factors; Gasoline vehicle; Light duty vehicles; Organics; PM$-2.5$; Source profiles; Vehicle exhausts; Dynamometers; chemical analysis; chemical composition; engine; exhaust emission; particulate matter; source identification; China","Hao, Y.; School of Automobile, China; эл. почта: haoyz828@qq.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"34088135","English","Sci.

While some exotic species establish, spread and impact native ecosystems, others establish with little or no measurable impact. Competitive ability has been highlighted as a key mechanism influencing invasion success and impact, but there is growing evidence that interactions between plants and soil biota may also be important. In particular, escape from natural enemies during the early stages of establishment may give exotic species an advantage over native species subject to their own natural enemies in the soil. Here, we evaluated whether the invasion success and impact of exotic grass species could be explained by competitive superiority over resident native species, advantages gained from the positive effects of native soil communities, or both. We assessed the competitive abilities of six grass species that vary in their invasion success relative to three widespread native grasses, quantified the effects of native soil microbial communities on the performance of both native and exotic grass species, and determined whether there was an interaction between competitive and soil effects. Overall, we found that exotic species were stronger competitors than natives and that native soil effects were weak and did not predict invasiveness. Differences in species relative competitive abilities also did not correlate with invasiveness but demonstrate how some exotic species could outcompete natives and suppress their growth during the invasion process. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Biological invasions; Competition; Invasive species; Plant-soil interactions","Poaceae","Bates, S.E.; Centre for Conservation Ecology and Genomics, Australia; эл. почта: sarah.bates@canberra.edu.au",,"Elsevier GmbH",00314056,,PDBLA,,"English","Pedobiologia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108402332

The usage of the co-produced digestate can lead to high acidification and eutrophication impacts, but this aspect is often not considered, neither is the way different substitution methods for the digestate affect the results. In this work we address these issues performing a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of CBG production through anaerobic digestion of animal manure and municipal organic waste (MOW). GHG savings of 93%–131% compared to the fossil diesel benchmark in the Renewable Energy Directive were found, thus complying with the 60% reduction target. The ammonia emissions during the digestate application make acidification and terrestrial eutrophication the main environmental burdens of CBG from MOW, leading to a 142% and a 715% increase for acidification and terrestrial eutrophication respectively, compared to fossil diesel. When CBG is produced from manure and the avoidance of manure storage emission is considered, a 257% and a 700% lower acidification and terrestrial eutrophication impact was found. Our results suggest that better manure-storage techniques are required and that field emissions due to digestate application, which is sensitive to pH and nitrogen content, should be reduced. It was further demonstrated that including the digestate fertilizing emissions in the system boundaries of the LCA of CBG production and substitution of both mineral fertilizer production and usage have a great impact on the outcome, but also introduce uncertainty of the results. The outcome of this work was used to suggest recommendations on the methodology for future LCA studies on CBG production and EU biofuel regulations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Digestate; Life cycle assessment; Manure; Municipal organic waste; Renewable energy directive","Acidification; Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Diesel engines; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Anaerobics; Biogas production; Digestate; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life-cycle environmental impact; Manure; Manure storages; Municipal organic waste; Organic wastes; Renewable energy directive; Life cycle","van den Oever, A.E.M.; Mobility, Pleinlaan 2, Belgium; эл. почта: anne.van.den.oever@vub.be",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

The pH of the first reactor (R1) was maintained at 5.5, whereas that of the others (R2/R3) was not controlled. The effluent from R3 was recirculated to R1 to amplify the alkalinity and lessen the NaOH quantity for pH regulation. The 3S-ASBR was continually operated to attain a steady state at a moderate COD loading rate (10 kg/m3d) with different reactor volumetric ratios under 37 °C, a fixed total liquid volume of 30 L and a constant recycle ratio of unity. A R1:R2:R3 volumetric ratio of 1:1.5:5 gave the highest COD reduction (90%) and yielded 343 mL CH4/g COD applied with an overall energy extraction efficiency of up to 66%. This volumetric ratio corresponded well to the generation time ratio of the microbes involved in the hydrolysis/acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis steps which can be applied to scale up both 3S-ASBR and three-step/stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (3S-UASB) systems.

The CO2 equivalent emissions and the methane leakage point will be identified at the end. The results indicate that compressed natural gas-based trucks have 18.7% less CO2 equivalent emissions than diesel-based ones. However, this benefit may be affected by methane leakage, particularly, in the recovery phase.

The authors have proposed and developed a unique research methodology, based on which a detailed exhaust emissions analysis (CO, HC, NOx, and PM) was carried out. The complex assessment included the unit and on‐track exhaust emissions. In the analyses, the authors also included the operating conditions of the powertrains of the tested machinery. The obtained environmental indexes were referred to the homologation standards, according to which the vehicles were approved for operation. Due to the nature of operation of the tested vehicles, the authors carried out a comprehensive environmental assessment in the daily and annual approach as well as in the aspect of their operation as combined vehicles, which is a novel approach to the assessment of the environmental performance of this type of objects. © 2021 by the authors.

This study is focused on the technical and economic feasibility of developing a biomethane gas network in a developing country, India. From the analysis, the retail price of the biomethane gas is estimated to be 0.63 USD/kg, which is quite competitive with the 0.65 USD/kg of compressed natural gas (CNG).

This study improves current literature by adding supply chain optimization options (cold energy recovery and hydrogen production) and by analyzing the entire supply chain of four different LNG end-users (power generation, industrial heating, residential heating, and truck usage). This resulted in 33 LNG pathways for which the energy efficiency, life cycle GHG emissions, and life cycle costs were determined by process-based material and energy flow analysis, life cycle assessment, and production cost calculation, respectively. The LNG and hydrogen supply chains were compared with a reference chain (coal or diesel) to determine avoided GHG emissions and GHG avoidance costs. Results show that NG with full cryogenic carbon dioxide capture (FCCC) is most beneficial pathway for both avoided GHG emissions and GHG avoidance costs (70.5–112.4 g CO2-e/MJLNG and 66.0–95.9 $/t CO2-e). The best case was obtained when NG with FCCC replaces coal-fired power plants.

To manage the organic waste from small cassava industry in Brazil, a waste-water-energy-food nexus (WWEF) system is proposed, combining AD and co-generation or combined heat and power (CHP) plants. However, the environmental impacts and benefits of this system are yet not known. By using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, environmental impacts of three scenarios are assessed, i.e. business-as-usual (base), improved business-as-usual and WWEF closed-loop. Functional unit (FU) in this study is defined as generating 1 kg cassava starch/flour. Global warming potential (GWP), cumulative energy demand (CED), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEP), terrestrial acidification potential (TAP) and water depletion potential (WDP) are selected. Landfilling cassava waste, power use for cassava starch and flour production, and emissions from fertilizer application are identified as environmental hotspots for business-as-usual case, suggesting making decisions on these aspects when dealing with environmental impacts. By using cassava waste to recover energy and nutrients for Brazilian rural family farming, the WWEF system is identified as the best environment-friendly scenario with lowest environmental impacts for the selected impact categories. The impact savings of the closed-loop scenario for GWP are over 90%, while over 50% of emissions for other selected impact categories, except FEP (lower than 10%), are saved compared to the business-as-usual and improved scenarios. Sensitivity analysis reinforces the results. Overall, this study provides a view on the potential of using cassava waste for the WWEF closed-loop system in Brazil, suggesting that the proposed WWEF closed-loop system is feasible and beneficial for small industries from the environmental perspective. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Environmental impacts; LCA; Manioc; Starch; Yuca","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Cogeneration plants; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Life cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Starch; Anaerobic digester; Anaerobics; Business-as-usual; Cassava starch; Closed-loop; Fresh Water; Global warming potential; Manioc; Water energy; Yuca; Plants (botany)","Campos, L.C.; Dept.

They can be used to produce electricity, second-generation ethanol, and biogas. These three kinds of fuel are energy carriers that can be used to propel light vehicles. Thus, we assessed the use of these two residues as a primary fuel to propel light vehicles. For this assessment, this article takes into account, for the same amount of primary energy, the distance one can drive, the emission of CO2, the water usage, the expenditure to build the facilities, and some qualitative indicators, such as health and handleability. It is found that bringing straw from the field increases the production of biofuels and mitigates the environmental impact. Considering the different energy carriers (ethanol, electricity, and biogas), it is possible to conclude that depending on the criteria used to analyze these energy carriers, one carrier would be preferred to another. For example, taking into account the return on the investment, electricity would be the least preferable one, while analyzing health, electricity would be the most preferable one. The uncertainty associated with the analysis is captured using the Monte Carlo approach. Thus, some indicators, such as the distance one can drive and the CO2 emissions, show that they depend on the uncertainty associated with the conversion efficiency of the different processes and the vehicle mileage-rate. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Bagasse; Biofuels; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Electric power generation; Environmental impact; Ethanol; Investments; Uncertainty analysis; CO2 emissions; Energy carriers; Light vehicles; Monte Carlo approach; Primary energies; Primary fuels; Second generation; Sugar-cane bagasse; Light weight vehicles; biofuel; carbon emission; crop residue; efficiency measurement; electricity; straw; sugar cane; transport vehicle","Nicula De Castro, R.E.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Av.

Using lignocellulosic materials, especially from agricultural and forestry sectors could help reduce the over-dependence on petrochemical resources while providing a sustainable waste management alternative. This review aims to describe the chemistry of different components of lignocellulosic biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, extractives and ash). Besides, many novel industrial applications of lignocellulosic biomass have been comprehensively described, which includes biorefining for biofuel and biochemical production, biomedical, cosmeceuticals and pharmaceuticals, bioplastics, multifunctional carbon materials and other eco-friendly specialty products. The production and applications of lignocellulose-derived carbon materials such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanohorns, etc. have been highlighted. The potential industrial utility of cellulose and lignin-based specialty materials such as cellulose fiber, bacterial cellulose, epoxides, polyolefins, phenolic resins, bioplastics are discussed in this review.

Data from industry reports and the peer-reviewed literature show that through AcoD, numerous examples of WWTPs have become net energy producers, necessitating other high-value applications for surplus biogas. A globally emerging trend is to upgrade biogas to biomethane, which can then be used as town gas or transport fuel. Water, organic solvent and chemical scrubbing, pressure swing adsorption, membrane separation, and cryogenic technology are commercially available CO2 removal technologies for biogas upgrade. Although water scrubbing is currently the most widely applied technology due to low capital and operation cost, significant market growth in membrane separation has been seen over the 2015–2019 period. Further progress in materials engineering and sciences is expected and will further enhance the membrane separation competitiveness for biogas upgrading. Several emerging biotechnologies to i) improve biogas quality from AcoD; ii) accelerate the absorption rate, and iii) captures CO2 in microalgal culture have also been examined and discussed in this review. Through a combination of AcoD and biogas upgrade, more WWTPs are expected to become net energy producers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic co-digestion; Bioenergy; Biogas upgrading; Biogas utilisation; Biomethane","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Separation; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Anaerobic co-digestion; Chemical scrubbing; Cryogenic technologies; Materials engineering; Membrane separation; Microalgal cultures; Pressure swing adsorption; Wastewater treatment plants; Anaerobic digestion; activated carbon; ammonia; biogas; biomethane; hydrogen sulfide; methane; organic solvent; siloxane; unclassified drug; water; biofuel; methane; anaerobic digestion; bioenergy; biogas; critical analysis; innovation; methane; wastewater treatment plant; adsorption; anaerobic co digestion; anaerobic digestion; biotechnology; chemical analysis; chemical oxygen demand; chemical scrubbing; electricity; feasibility study; microalga; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; organic fraction of municipal solid waste; physical scrubbing; pressure swing adsorption; Review; sewage; trend study; waste water treatment plant; water vapor; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; digestion; water management; Anaerobiosis; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Digestion; Methane; Water Purification","Nguyen, L.N.; Centre for Technology in Water and Wastewater, Australia; эл. почта: luongngoc.nguyen@uts.edu.au",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"33121765","English","Sci.

However, there remain environmental risks at different stages in the entire process from exploitation to utilization. Firstly, this article identifies various environmental risks and benefits of natural gas along the entire industry chain from upstream exploitation and midstream transportation to downstream utilization. It is found that, during upstream exploitation, hydraulic fracturing has the worst environmental impact. During the midstream storage and transportation stage, methane leakage is the biggest environmental risk. In the downstream combustion and utilization stage, the risk to environment is less than other energy sources, although there are some greenhouse gas effects and water pollution issues. Thus, this article puts forward some policy recommendations for different stages from exploitation to utilization. In the upstream stage, especially hydraulic fracturing activity, we suggest strengthening environmental assessment management, improving policy standards, creating a water quality monitoring plan, and promoting the innovation of key technologies. In terms of the midstream, besides pipeline laying and site selection, we focus on monitoring the system, including leak detection, quality management of engineering materials, and risk identification and management. When it comes to the downstream, we encourage the application of advanced technologies to improve thermal efficiency and reduce emissions, such as gas-fired related technologies, natural gas recycling technologies, distributed energy technologies, and green and low-carbon service technologies. © Copyright © 2021 Fu, Liu and Sun.","control measures; different stages; environmental risks; life cycle assessment; natural gas","Carbon; Climate change; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydraulic fracturing; Leak detection; Natural gas; Quality management; Risk management; Rivers; Site selection; Water pollution; Water quality; Development and utilizations; Distributed energies; Engineering materials; Environmental assessment; Policy recommendations; Risk identification and management; Storage and transportations; Water quality monitoring; Natural gas transportation","Fu, J.; School of Economics and Management, China; эл. почта: 691047672@qq.com",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",2296598X,,,,"English","Front.

Natural gas flaring practices waste valuable energy resources that can be used for economic support and will also be beneficial to mitigate global warming effects. In this review, an overview of natural gas flaring impacts with respect to the environment with special emphasis on global annual natural gas flaring emissions and their reformation to energy-efficient fuels has been discussed. Initially, natural gas flaring emissions and their impacts in view of environmental pollution and global warming effects have been highlighted. The strategies to mitigate wastage to valuable energy resources through various flaring management strategies are also evaluated. In the main stream, various gas flaring reductions and utilization technologies based on their applications in the oil and gas industry and especially for remote oil and gas fields are discussed. Liquified natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) technologies have been identified as the main gas flaring reduction methods based on their applicability, commerciality, and economical potential. In addition, gas to liquid (GTL) has been an advancing technology for the past many years toward its utilization of methane as a feed and converting it to useful industrial products such as synthesis crude and methanol. Finally, reformation technologies for synthesis gas (syngas) production such as thermal reforming, plasma reforming, and photoreforming are deliberated. Based on feed gas mixture, different reforming processes such as steam reforming of methane (SRM), dry reforming of methane (DRM), and bi-reforming of methane (BRM) are evaluated for hydrogen-rich syngas production. The future perspectives regarding gas flaring utilization technologies advancement with further improvements in utilization of flared gas to efficient energy fuels are proposed. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Flare stacks; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Global warming; Liquefied natural gas; Liquid methane; Methane; Natural gas deposits; Petroleum industry; Steam reforming; Synthesis gas; Synthesis gas manufacture; Compressed natural gas technologies; Dry reforming-of-methane; Environmental pollutions; Management strategies; Oil and gas production; Steam reforming of methane; Synthesis gasses (syngas); Utilization of methane; Compressed natural gas","Tahir, M.; Chemical Reaction Engineering Group (GREG), Malaysia; эл. почта: m.thair@utm.my",,"American Chemical Society",08870624,,ENFUE,,"English","Energy Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102054465

Here, we review current knowledge of the neurons, signal transduction molecules and regulatory mechanisms that underlie the response of C. elegans to chemicals, including pheromones. The majority of identified molecules and pathways share remarkable homology with sensory mechanisms in other organisms.

A comprehensive suite of measurements of 90 non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) (C2-C14), including 12 speciated monoterpenes and higher molecular weight monoaromatics, were made at an urban site in Old Delhi during the pre-monsoon (28-May to 05-Jun 2018) and post-monsoon (11 to 27-Oct 2018) seasons using dual-channel gas chromatography (DC-GC-FID) and two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC-FID). Significantly higher mixing ratios of NMHCs were measured during the post-monsoon campaign, with a mean night-Time enhancement of around 6. Like with NOx and CO, strong diurnal profiles were observed for all NMHCs, except isoprene, with very high NMHC mixing ratios between 35-1485 ppbv. The sum of mixing ratios of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) routinely exceeded 100 ppbv at night during the post-monsoon period, with a maximum measured mixing ratio of monoaromatic species of 370 ppbv. The mixing ratio of highly reactive monoterpenes peaked at around 6 ppbv in the post-monsoon campaign and correlated strongly with anthropogenic NMHCs, suggesting a strong non-biogenic source in Delhi. A detailed source apportionment study was conducted which included regression analysis to CO, acetylene and other NMHCs, hierarchical cluster analysis, EPA UNMIX 6.0, principal component analysis/absolute principal component scores (PCA/APCS) and comparison with NMHC ratios (benzene/toluene and i-/n-pentane) in ambient samples to liquid and solid fuels. These analyses suggested the primary source of anthropogenic NMHCs in Delhi was from traffic emissions (petrol and diesel), with average mixing ratio contributions from Unmix and PCA/APCS models of 38% from petrol, 14% from diesel and 32% from liquified petroleum gas (LPG) with a smaller contribution (16%) from solid fuel combustion. Detailed consideration of the underlying meteorology during the campaigns showed that the extreme night-Time mixing ratios of NMHCs during the post-monsoon campaign were the result of emissions into a very shallow and stagnant boundary layer. The results of this study suggest that despite widespread open burning in India, traffic-related petrol and diesel emissions remain the key drivers of gas-phase urban air pollution in Delhi.

This use, however, leads to rising spatial and temporal disbalances between electricity generation and consumption. To address the associated challenges, Power-to-X technologies are considered to harness surplus electricity from renewable sources and convert it into an alternative energy source that can be utilized, transported and stored. The aim of this paper is to compare four different Power-to-X technologies, whereby surplus electricity “Power” is converted to chemical entities “X”. It is shown that the implementation of PtX technologies and a shift of energy distribution to other transport methods could significantly relieve the electricity grid. Moreover, by converting the electricity from renewable sources, like wind farms, into chemical energy sources, the PtX concept offers the opportunity of making larger quantities of energy storable over longer periods of time. By considering a model case where electricity generation and consumption are several hundred kilometres apart, the generation of fuels emerges as a technology with the highest potential to mitigate climate change. Also with regard to transport, fuels emerge as the most favourable option for transporting chemically bound energy. Common to all options is the yield of a significant stream of oxygen as by-product.

First, the problem is investigated in a fuzzy environment. Secondly, multiple decision-makers involve in decision-making process. It allows the moderator to benefit the opinions of multiple experts. Third, experts are assigned a coefficient considering their professional career represented in years. In the conventional approach, the experts have assumed identical, but expert prioritization deals with the instability. The extensions applied in this study are currently available in the literature, and it is used for the first time in the EVAMIX method. This method can be applied to decision-making problems in any research field. A study is carried out to combine the pre-determined types of ships with reliable quantitative and qualitative criteria and create data for new investors and shipowners in the selection of ships using a novel mathematical approach. As a result of the study, preferences are modelled for candidate ships, and database and value options are presented to decision-makers, ship owners, and investors. The qualitative and quantitative data discussed in this selection process to support the decision-making process and can be designed appropriately to be used in similar selection problems. The most suitable vessel to be selected from the candidate's vessels is carried out based on the existing criteria being evaluated; therefore, it is a reference for similar methodologies. © 2020 The Authors","Decision-making; EVAMIX; Expert systems; Fuzzy sets; Shipping industry",,"Yazır, D.; Surmene Faculty of Marine Sciences, Turkey; эл. почта: dyazir@ktu.edu.tr",,"Korean Association of Shipping and Logistics, Inc.",20925212,,,,"English","Asian J.

Biofuels are seen as one of the options to limit these emissions in Europe. To understand the recent evolution of biofuels and their future, this review gives an overview on the production, use, legislation, and environmental impacts of biofuels in Europe for light-duty vehicles. In 2017, biofuels made up 4.5% of the energy consumption in the road transport and non-road mobile machinery. Biodiesel in 2018 accounted for 62% of the biofuels consumed in the EU, followed by bioethanol (17.5%), HVO (16.6%), upgraded biogas (1.7%) and bio-ETBE (1.1%). A review of 86 LCA studies published between 2013 and 2020 indicated that the climate change impact of biofuels is generally lower than diesel and petrol, with average emission savings depending on the type of biofuel: 70% for biohydrogen, 63% for upgraded biogas, 41% for pure biodiesel, between 54% and 7% for bioethanol (depending on the blend percentage, between 100% and 10%). An important issue identified is the limited consideration of the land use change effects, which are rarely assessed and are of paramount importance, as the values found in this review were as high as 231 g CO2eq/MJ in some cases and thus non-negligible. Biofuels perform generally similarly or worse than fossil fuels for most of the non-GHG-related impact categories, except for ozone, fossil resource and abiotic depletion. Currently, it is highly recommended to move towards non-edible feedstocks, waste and by-products which guarantee a lower risk of land use change. The European legislation, through the Directive 2018/2001 and the regulation 2019/807, is pushing in that direction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-SNG; Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Biofuel; Biogas; Biohydrogen; Biomethane; Biomethanol; Climate change; GHG; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Systematic review; Transportation; Vehicle","Automobiles; Biodiesel; Biogas; Climate change; Commercial vehicles; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Laws and legislation; Light weight vehicles; Machinery; Roads and streets; Abiotic depletion; Climate change impact; European legislation; Fossil resources; Light commercial vehicles; Light duty vehicles; Non-road mobile machineries; Transport sectors; Bioethanol","Puricelli, S.; AWARE - Assessment on WAste and Resources, Italy; эл. почта: stefano.puricelli@polimi.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094157842

However, the emission reduction impacts of EVs in China have been widely debated and the conclusions of existing studies are still controversial. In this study, we adopted the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to evaluate the carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollutant emissions from the stage of vehicle production, vehicle use and vehicle end-of-life. We further compared the emissions of three types of passenger vehicles in China, including internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), and battery electric vehicle (BEV). Compared with ICEV, BEV and PHEV were found to reduce the emissions of CO2, VOCs, and NOX, but increase the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2. These differences were primarily caused by EV's high fuel efficiency and high fuel consumption of ICEV. Additional findings indicate that the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2 of BEV were 2.6 and 2.1 times that of ICEV, respectively; and the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2 of PHEV were 1.8 and 1.5 times that of ICEV, respectively. Moreover, we found the emissions of PM2.5 and SO2 of EV will be higher than that of ICEV in high renewable energy scenario with higher biomass share if keeping the emission factor of electricity constant. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Electric vehicle; Life cycle assessment","Air quality; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Combustion; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy security; Internal combustion engines; Life cycle; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutant emission; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental assessment; Global climate changes; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Vehicle end-of-life; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","Yu, B.; Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, China; эл. почта: yubiying_bj@bit.edu.cn

This also guides environmental engineers in identifying the pollution sources and developing appropriate strategies in mitigating them. The aim of this study was to systematically analyse published literature to identify the interaction of the nature and regional distribution of pollution sources in Nigeria in the domain of surface water, groundwater, and rainwater quality. The scope of the analysis was on published literature on the subject in the last two decades. Regional distribution was observed to affect pollution sources for surface water, groundwater and rainwater in Nigeria as differences were observed in each geopolitical zone. Several research questions were raised which became the focus of the literature analysis. The major sources of surface water, groundwater and rainwater pollution in Nigeria were identified as industrial effluent (18% of research output), hydrogeology (25% of research output), and roof type (31%) respectively. Some 13% of surface water sources, 17% of groundwater sources and 8% of rainwater sources were adjudged to be clean based on World Health Organisation guidelines. The onus still falls on government related stakeholders, policy makers and industry based decision makers to instigate, develop and actualise sustainable waste management and water treatment approaches in the mitigation of water pollution in the country. The current study provides key information that could influence such decisions especially in view of the choice of process type for cleaner production that would cater for the specific needs of the various geopolitical zones. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Groundwater; Nigeria; Pollution sources; Rainwater; Surface water; Water quality","Decision making; Effluents; Geographical distribution; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Hydrogeology; Industrial research; Pollution control; River pollution; Sewage; Waste treatment; Water quality; Water treatment; Groundwater sources; Industrial effluent; Literature analysis; Regional distribution; Research questions; Surface water sources; Sustainable waste management; Water quality monitoring; Surface waters","Ighalo, J.O.; Department of Chemical Engineering, P.

Numerous researches have been conducted for the function of its fruits but scarcely focused on the somaclonal variation and DNA methylation. An efficient micropropagation protocol from leaves and stems of L. ruthenicum was developed in this study, in which not only the leaf explants but also the stem explants of L. ruthenicum were dedifferentiated and produced adventitious buds/multiple shoots on one type of medium. Notably, the efficient indirect organogenesis of stem explants was independent of exogenous auxin, which is contrary to the common conclusion that induction and proliferation of calli is dependent on exogenous auxin. We proposed that sucrose supply might be the crucial regulator of stem callus induction and proliferation of L. ruthenicum. Furthermore, results of methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) showed that DNA methylation somaclonal variation (MSV) of CNG decreased but that of CG increased after acclimatization. Three types of micropropagated plants (from leaf calli, stem calli and axillary buds) were epigenetically diverged more from each other after acclimatization and the ex vitro micropropagated plants should be selected to determine the fidelity. In summary, plants micropropagated from axillary buds and leaves of L. ruthenicum was more fidelity and might be suitable for preservation and propagation of elite germplasm. Also, leaf explants should be used in transformation. Meanwhile, plants from stem calli showed the highest MSV and might be used in somaclonal variation breeding. Moreover, one MSV hotspot was found based on biological replicates. The study not only provided foundations for molecular breeding, somaclonal variation breeding, preservation and propagation of elite germplasm, but also offered clues for further revealing novel mechanisms of both stem-explant dedifferentiation and MSV of L. ruthenicum.

Although there are many carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods, they are very costly and their long term use raises concern about environmental safety. Alternatively, bio-sequestration of CO2 using microalgal cell factories has emerged as a promising way of recycling CO2 into biomass via photosynthesis. In the present study, Indigenous algal strain Pseudanabaena limnetica was cultivated in pneumatically agitated 60-L flat-panel photobioreactor system. The gas was released from Bio-CNG plant as by-product into Na2CO3-rich medium and cultivated in semicontinuous mode of operation. It was observed that when CO2 was sparged in seawater-based 0.02 M Na2CO3 solution, maximum CO2 was dissolved in the system and was used for algal cultivation. Control system produced 0.64 ± 0.035 g/L of biomass at the end of 15 days, whereas CO2 sparged Na2CO3 medium produced 0.81 ± 0.046 g/L of biomass. When CO2 from Bio-CNG station was fed, it resulted in biomass production of 1.62 ± 0.070 g/L at the end of 18 days compared to 1.46 ± 0.066 g/L of biomass produced in control system which was not fed with gas released from Bio-CNG plant as by-product. Thus, feeding CO2 directly into Na2CO3 medium and operating the system semicontinuously would be efficient for scrubbing CO2 from commercial Bio-CNG plant. This study proves that feeding CO2 gas from Bio-CNG plant into Na2CO3-rich alkaline system can be used to feed algae for enhanced biomass production. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bio-CNG; CO2; Flat-panel photobioreactor; Semicontinuous mode","Biomass; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Compressed natural gas; Control systems; Greenhouse gases; Seawater; Sodium Carbonate; Algal cultivations; Biomass productions; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Environmental safety; Flat panel; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Semi-continuous mode; Sequestration of CO2; Sodium compounds","Deodhar, M.A.; Botany Research Laboratory, Mithagar Road, Mulund East, India; эл. почта: drmadeodhar@gmail.com",,"Springer Nature",25233971,,,,"English","SN Appl.

However, it may be difficult to know what technology, or combination of technologies, to choose. There is a need for improved knowledge and supportive methods for sustainability assessments that can support public procurement processes. In the companion article (Part I), a multi-criteria assessment (MCA) method for assessments of public bus technologies’ sustainability was established, consisting of four key areas and 12 indicators. In this article, the purpose is to apply the method established in part I on different bus technologies by looking at a general Swedish case and assessing buses driven on diesel, Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME), ethanol, natural gas, biomethane and electricity. Each technology is assessed on a scale from Very Poor to Very Good according to the indicators: technical maturity, daily operational availability, total cost of ownership, need for investments in infrastructure, cost stability, non-renewable primary energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emission savings, air pollution, noise, local/regional impact on land and aquatic environments, energy security and sociotechnical systems services.

Current energy demand is mostly fulfilled by finite fossil reserves, which has critical impact on the environment and thus, there is a need for carbon-neutral energy. In this view, biohydrogen (bio-H2) is considered suitable due to its potential as a green and dependable carbon-neutral energy source in the emerging ‘Hydrogen Economy’. Bio-H2 production by dark fermentation of biowaste/biomass/wastewater is gaining significant attention. However, bio-H2 production still holds critical challenges towards scale-up with reference to process limitations and economic viabilities. This review illustrates the status of dark-fermentation process in the context of process sustainability and achieving commercial success. The review also provides an insight on various process integrations for maximum resource recovery including closed loop biorefinery approach towards the accomplishment of carbon neutral H2 production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon-neutral hydrogen; Distributed metabolism; Hydrogen economy; Sustainability; Volatile Fatty Acids (VFAs)","Carbon; Fermentation; Hydrogen economy; Sustainable development; Critical challenges; Economic viability; Global urbanization; Impact on the environment; Material consumption; Process integration; Process sustainability; Renewable hydrogen production; Hydrogen production; hydrogen; hydrogen; alternative energy; fermentation; fossil fuel; hydrogen; sustainability; urbanization; acidogenic fermentation; biocatalyst; dark fermentation; economic aspect; environmental sustainability; fermentation; fermentative hydrogen production; genetic engineering; immobilization; metabolism; microflora; negative feedback; nonhuman; priority journal; recycling; biomass; fermentation; waste water; Biomass; Fermentation; Hydrogen; Waste Water","Mohan, S.V.; Bioengineering and Environmental Science Lab, India; эл. почта: svmohan@iict.res.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",09608524,,BIRTE,"33277136","English","Bioresour.

Typically, large aggregations of jellyfish are carried by currents through salmon pens, leading to unsustainable mortality levels in some years. One potential solution that has been regularly proposed is the creation of a ‘bubble curtain’ around fish pens. A bubble curtain is created by releasing compressed air from a perforated tube at depth, forming a plume of bubbles that entrain the water to create a vertical current. This study investigated the efficacy of a bubble curtain as a jellyfish barrier at several aquaculture locations in Ireland and in a controlled flume tank. Field tests on bubble curtains provided mixed results: a high air flow 8 m linear bubble curtain set at 5 m depth effectively deflected large compass jellyfish (Chrysaora hysoscella), whereas, a low air flow ca. 800 m circular bubble curtain set at 5 m depth, around a salmon farm, did not significantly impact the abundance of small hydromedusae on either side of the bubble curtain. Flume tank experiments demonstrated that increased wave height and increased air flow increased jellyfish transport through the curtain and the lateral movement was consistent with Stokes drift, i.e. an elliptical motion that includes forward movement with each wave. These results suggest that sites with relatively high wave energy may be unsuitable for bubble curtain use and that the variable size and shape of jellyfish may be an important factor in jellyfish and bubble curtain interactions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aquaculture; Fish farming; Fish mortalities; Muggiaea; Pelagia; Salmon","airflow; aquaculture production; aquaculture system; compressed air; fish culture; jellyfish; mortality; plume; recirculating system; wave energy; wave height; Ireland; Chrysaora hysoscella; Hydrozoa; Muggiaea; Pelagia; Scyphozoa","Haberlin, D.; MaREI - Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Energy, Haulbowline Road, Ireland; эл. почта: d.haberlin@ucc.ie",,"Elsevier B.V.",00448486,,AQCLA,,"English","Aquaculture",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090547475

Animals were genotyped using the Illumina BovineLD v2 BeadChip (7K). Genomic structure analysis confirmed that the South African Simbra cattle have an admixed genome, composed of 5/8 Taurine and 3/8 Indicine, ensuring that the Simbra genome maintains favorable traits from both breeds. Genomic regions that have been targeted by selection were detected using the linkage disequilibrium-based methods iHS and Rsb. These analyses identified 10 candidate regions that are potentially under strong positive selection, containing genes implicated in cattle health and production (e.g., TRIM63, KCNA10, NCAM1, SMIM5, MIER3, and SLC24A4). These adaptive alleles likely contribute to the biological and cellular functions determining phenotype in the Simbra hybrid cattle breed. Our data suggested that these alleles were introgressed from the breed's original indicine and taurine ancestors. The Simbra breed thus possesses derived parental alleles that combine the superior traits of the founder Brahman and Simmental breeds. These regions and genes might represent good targets for ad-hoc physiological studies, selection of breeding material and eventually even gene editing, for improved traits in modern cattle breeds. This study represents an important step toward developing and improving strategies for selection and population breeding to ultimately contribute meaningfully to the beef production industry. © Copyright © 2021 van der Nest, Hlongwane, Hadebe, Chan, van der Merwe, De Vos, Greyling, Kooverjee, Soma, Dzomba, Bradfield and Muchadeyi.","crossbreeding; genomic selection; indicine; simbra; taurine","CD56 antigen; genomic DNA; muscle RING finger 1 protein; taurine; allele; animal experiment; Article; breeding; cattle breed; cell function; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; cross breeding; DNA extraction; gene; gene editing; gene frequency; gene insertion; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; gene mapping; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic variability; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; genotype; haplotype; heterozygosity; lactation; nonhuman; phenotype; physical activity; quality control; reproductive success; Simmental cattle; single nucleotide polymorphism; South Africa; structure analysis","van der Nest, M.A.; Biotechnology Platform, South Africa; эл. почта: vandernestm@arc.agric.za

Air pollution and particulate matter have merged as a global challenge in recent years because of its growing health and socio-economic risks. The intensity and impacts of these risks have become more pronounced, especially in developing countries like Pakistan that lack adequate warning, protection, and management systems. Various epidemiological studies have linked poor air quality with different health disorders and increasing death rates. In Pakistan, mortality rates as a result of exposure to increased levels of air pollutants, especially particulate matter, are alarming. According to the World Bank's estimates, Pakistan's annual burden of disease from outdoor air pollution is responsible for around 22,000 premature adult deaths and 163,432 DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) lost. The concentration of major air pollutants in Pakistan, such as NOx, O3, and SO2 have also been increasing significantly over the last two decades. Several studies are also reporting multiple instances of air quality around the major cities of Pakistan being consistently exceeding the national guidelines. During teh year 2019 PM2.5 cocnentrations in the city of Lahore revealed that almost every single day was in exceedance of the WHO and national air quality standards. Although the substantial effects of these rising pollutant concentrations in Pakistan have been stated in a few studies, however, the total extent, nature of contributing factors, and consequences remain inadequately understood. This study aims to use data available from monitoring stations, satellites, and literature to highlight the gaps in our understanding and emphasize the critical challenges associated with poor air quality faced in Pakistan. Topmost is the lack of air quality monitoring systems followed by poor initiatives by policymakers and enforcement agencies. A way forward while addressing these key challenges is also discussed, which focuses on the development of flexible monitoring, new technologies, and monitoring approaches in addition to communications among the various public, private agencies, and all relevant stakeholders. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","emerged environmental challenge; Health risk; Particulate matter; policy debate; socio-economic disruptions","Air quality standards; Developing countries; Health risks; Monitoring; Particles (particulate matter); Population statistics; Sulfur dioxide; Air quality monitoring; Dalys (disabilityadjusted life years); Epidemiological studies; Monitoring approach; Monitoring stations; National Air Quality Standards; Outdoor air pollution; Pollutant concentration; Air quality; fuel; mustard gas; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; correlation; disease incidence; environmental modeling; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; socioeconomic status; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; air quality standard; Article; awareness; building industry; combustion; energy; environmental policy; industry; mortality rate; Pakistan; particulate matter; particulate matter 2.5; politics; traffic and transport; Lahore; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]","Khokhar, M.F.; Institute of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Pakistan; эл. почта: fahim.khokhar@iese.nust.edu.pk",,"Elsevier B.V.",03043894,,JHMAD,"33254830","English","J.

One of the main causes are the effluents of the potash mining industry containing high concentrations of major ions (Cl−, Na+, Mg2+, K+). In Germany, the ongoing discharge of effluents into the River Werra led to a strong impoverishment of the biodiversity and abundance of local species. Young cohorts of many freshwater fish are completely absent suggesting reproductive failure under these conditions. Therefore, the aim of the study was to experimentally investigate the effects of high concentrations and imbalances of ions that are prevalent in potash mining effluents on reproductive traits of native freshwater teleosts. Sperm motility parameters of the common roach, Rutilus rutilus, and European perch, Perca fluviatilis, were assessed as well as fertilization rate, egg size, hatching, malformations and mortality of embryonic and larval stages of roach. Concentrations of the permitted thresholds (HT) and future thresholds (LT) as well as three ion solutions containing high Mg2+ (Mg), high K+ (K) and both in combination (Mg + K) were tested. Curvilinear velocity and linearity of perch spermatozoa were elevated with potentially adverse effects on fertilization success. Sperm motility parameters and fertilization rate of roach were not affected. However, egg sizes of roach were increased in all groups due to the osmotic action of ions and in LT, premature hatch was observed. Furthermore, all groups comprised a higher number of malformations including pericardial edema and spine curvatures and group HT exhibited a higher mortality rate compared to control. The results clearly demonstrated that particularly the sum of high concentrations of ions, as prevalent in HT and LT, rather than individual ion species exerts detrimental effects on early development of roach potentially increasing overall mortality under natural conditions. These results emphasize that currently permitted and future thresholds are exceeding tolerated ion concentrations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Early life stages; Fertilization; Freshwater fish; Ion imbalances; Secondary salinization; Spermatozoa","Biodiversity; Population statistics; Potash; Water; Fertilization rates; Fertilization success; Freshwater ecosystem; Freshwater fishes; Ion concentrations; Natural conditions; Perca fluviatilis; Reproductive traits; Ions; chloride ion; industrial effluent; ion; magnesium ion; potassium carbonate; potassium ion; sodium ion; ion; potassium carbonate; abundance; biodiversity; chlorine; concentration (composition); effluent; magnesium; mine waste; motility; potash; potassium; sodium; sperm; teleost; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; biodiversity; chemical procedures; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; developmental disorder; effluent; egg size; embryo; female; fertilization; freshwater environment; freshwater fish; Germany; hatching; heart edema; larval stage; male; male genital system; mining; mortality rate; nonhuman; osmosis; Perca fluviatilis; population abundance; priority journal; river; Rutilus rutilus; secondary salinization; spermatozoon; spermatozoon motility; spine disease; survival; teleost; animal; Cyprinidae; drug mixture; ecosystem; human; mining; perch; spermatozoon motility; Germany; Werra River; Perca fluviatilis; Rutilus rutilus; Teleostei; Animals; Complex Mixtures; Cyprinidae; Ecosystem; Germany; Humans; Ions; Male; Mining; Perches; Sperm Motility","Baberschke, N.; Department of Ecophysiology and Aquaculture, Müggelseedamm 310, Germany; эл. почта: baberschke@igb-berlin.de",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"32898804","English","Sci.

These data are applicable for a top-down approach towards the verification of anthropogenic CO2 emissions from megacities and updating of the inventory. However, great uncertainties regarding natural CO2 flux estimates remain when back-casting CO2 emissions from concentration data, making accurate disaggregation of urban CO2 sources difficult. For this study, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land products, meso-scale meteorological data, SoilGrids250 m soil profile data, and sub-daily soil moisture datasets to calculate hourly photosynthetic CO2 uptake and biogenic CO2 emissions with 500 m resolution for the Kantō Plain, Japan, at the center of which is the Tokyo metropolis. Our hourly integrated modeling results obtained for the period 2010–2018 suggest that, collectively, the vegetated land within the Greater Tokyo Area served as a daytime carbon sink year-round, where the hourly integrated net atmospheric CO2 removal was up to 14.15 ± 4.24% of hourly integrated anthropogenic emissions in winter and up to 55.42 ± 10.39% in summer. At night, plants and soil in the Greater Tokyo Area were natural carbon sources, with hourly integrated biogenic CO2 emissions equivalent to 2.27 ± 0.11%–4.97 ± 1.17% of the anthropogenic emissions in winter and 13.71 ± 2.44%–23.62 ± 3.13% in summer. Between January and July, the hourly integrated biogenic CO2 emissions of the Greater Tokyo Area increased sixfold, whereas the amplitude of the midday hourly integrated photosynthetic CO2 uptake was enhanced by nearly five times and could offset up to 79.04 ± 12.31% of the hourly integrated anthropogenic CO2 emissions in summer. The gridded hourly photosynthetic CO2 uptake and biogenic respiration estimates not only provide reference data for the estimation of total natural CO2 removal in our study area, but also supply prior input values for the disaggregation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and biogenic CO2 fluxes when applying top-down approaches to update the megacity’s CO2 emissions inventory. The latter contribution allows unprecedented amounts of GOSAT and ground measurement data regarding CO2 concentration to be analyzed in inverse modeling of anthropogenic CO2 emissions from Tokyo and the Kantō Plain. © 2021 by the authors.

Alongside nitrogen oxides (NOx) and PM, ammonia (NH3) is also a relevant air pollutant due to its role as a precursor of particulate ammonium. This is a study about the short-term temporal dynamics of urban NH3 concentrations in Münster, northwest Germany, the role of road traffic and agriculture as NH3 sources and about the importance of ammonia for secondary particle formation (SPF). The NH3 mixing ratio was rather high (mean: 17 ppb) compared to other urban areas and showed distinct diurnal maxima around 10 a.m. and during the night at 9 p.m. The main source for ammonia in Münster was agriculture, but road traffic also contributed through local emissions from vehicle catalysts. NH3 from surrounding agricultural areas accumulated in the nocturnal boundary layer and contributed to SPF in the city center. Modeled emissions of NH3 as estimated by the Handbook for Emission Factors in combination with traffic counts were in the same magnitude for NH3. The size-resolved chemical composition of inorganic ions in PM10 was dominated by NH4+ (8.66 µg m–3), followed by NO3– (3.89 µg m–3), SO42– (1.58 µg m–3) and Cl– (1.33 µg m–3). Particles in the accumulation range (diameter: 0.1– 1 µm) showed the highest inorganic ion concentrations. The ammonium neutralization index J (111%) indicated an excess of NH4+ leading to mostly alkaline PM. High ammonia emissions from surrounding agricultural areas combined with large amounts of NOx from road traffic play a crucial role for SPF in Münster. © The Author(s).","Agriculture; Ammonia sources; Fine particulate matter; Road traffic; Urban air quality","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Air pollution; Alkalinity; Boundary layers; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Roads and streets; Agricultural areas; Ambient air pollution; Chemical compositions; Fine particulate matter; Nocturnal boundary layers; Secondary particles; Source apportionment; Urban environments; Ammonia; ambient air; ammonium; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; chemical composition; concentration (composition); mixing ratio; neutralization; nitrogen oxides; nocturnal boundary layer; particulate matter; road traffic; source apportionment; Germany","Ehrnsperger, L.; Climatology Research Group, Germany; эл. почта: laura.ehrnsperger@wwu.de",,"AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research",16808584,,,,"English","Aerosol Air Qual.

A system-by-system GHG emissions model was developed to determine which transit agencies are low, medium, or high emitters based on the metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted from mobile sources. A score card was created based on four preliminary indicators: (1) CO2e per passenger, per revenue vehicle kilometer; (2) CO2e per passenger, per service area density; (3) CO2e per vehicle, per revenue vehicle kilometer; and (4) CO2e per vehicle, per service area density. This score card provides a relative metric to compare the GHG emissions of different transit agencies which can be used as an audit standard for quantifying comparative CO2e reductions. The results indicated that one-third of transit agencies operate in the “A” grade range, while the remaining agencies received grades of “B” to “E”; thus, demonstrating the potential for utilizing Green Funds in different jurisdictions to advance technology and ridership solutions aimed at GHG emissions reduction to achieve climate change objectives. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon pricing systems; greenhouse gas modeling; report card; transit agencies","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Vehicles; GHG emission; Green funds; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Mobile sources; Ontario , Canada; Score cards; Service area; Transit agencies; Greenhouse gases","Jami, A.; T Transportation Research Institute, 35 St. George St, Canada",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",15568318,,,,"English","Intl.

From a list of potential knowledge needs, a group of fisheries professionals most frequently identified six top priorities for managing migratory fishes in Cambodia: (1) population abundances and trends, (2) life cycles and life history, (3) migration timing and triggers, (4) migration routes and distances, (5) locations of key habitats and spawning areas, and (6) environmental and habitat requirements. These needs are discussed along with nine relevant methodologies for addressing them, including fisheries-dependent and fisheries-independent sampling, reproductive techniques and captive studies, otolith and genetic analysis tools, and tagging and imaging techniques. A suggested research framework is also presented to inform adaptive management of migratory fishes. While emphasis is given to Cambodia, the analysis is also applicable to other LMB countries, given that migratory fishes occur throughout the basin and migrate across borders. It is suggested that a robust research and monitoring agenda is required to prioritise knowledge needs and select appropriate methodologies to answer questions vital to inform sustainable migratory fish management in Cambodia. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptive management; fish migration; fisheries technology; fresh water; inland fisheries; Lower Mekong Basin",,"Loury, E.K.; FISHBIOUnited States; эл. почта: erinloury@fishbio.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",0969997X,,,,"English","Fish.

Airborne microbiological composition and abundance was examined inside five different fuel type buses (diesel (EURO IV and EURO V), hybrid diesel (HD), compressed natural gas (CNG), hybrid natural gas (HCNG) and electric vehicle (EV)) from Barcelona bus system, inside and outside the tourist bus and different periods of campaigns (summer: May–September and winter: November–March). Quantitative PCR was used to quantify total bacteria, Penicillium/Aspergillus and Cladosporium sp. and Kinetic Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Assay for endotoxins. The targeted 16S rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced to asses bacterial community composition and biodiversity. Regarding the targeted microorganisms, the results showed low bioaerosol concentrations, being fungi and endotoxins below the detection limit, although bacterial airborne has a geometric average of 103 equivalent E. Coli genomes/m3. Airborne bacterial community biodiversity showed that Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most abundant Phylum in the different sampled buses and in the two seasons (summer: May–September and winter: November–March). While regarding to genera taxonomic category, the different fuel type buses presented a high overlap degree, being Cutibacterium the most abundant and Paracoccus the one only detected inside. The different seasons showed that the different taxonomic genera decrease from summer: May–September to winter: November–March and in this case Paracoccus was the most abundant. Overall, biodiversity inside buses is greatly affected by the presence of humans inside, but also by the outdoor sources at the moment of the sampling, and the seasonal period, more than the type of bus. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Bioaerosols; Indoor air quality; Public buses; Tourist bus",,"Duchaine, C.; Centre de Recherche de L’Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie Et de Pneumologie de Québec (IUCPQ), Canada; эл. почта: Caroline.Duchaine@bcm.ulaval.ca",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",03935965,,AROBF,,"English","Aerobiologia",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104116990

In this study, GHG emissions and global warming factors (GWFs) from waste collection vehicles were calculated for four different fuel types (diesel, gasoline, compressed natural gas and electricity) in Kocaeli, Turkey. Results showed that GHG emissions were determined by using a model and manual calculations as 10,853 tons CO2-eq and 10,265 tons CO2-eq, respectively. If diesel is used, the GWF values for the model and manual calculations were determined as 18 kg CO2-eq ton1 and 17 kg CO2-eq ton1, respectively. Furthermore, when gasoline, CNG, and electricity were used, GWFs were calculated as 13.3 kg CO2-eq ton1, 9.2 kg CO2-eq ton1 and 2.6 kg CO2-eq ton1, respectively. This study demonstrated that alternative fuels, especially electricity, have a great potential to reduce GHG emissions. In addition, opening up new transfer stations or a new landfill site can be considered as important steps in reducing GHG emissions.

The aim of the work was to improve the situation with frequent failures and unavailability that occur on the modernized locomotive where a new diesel engine and new electronic control system was installed. Within the work, a simplified methodology for evaluating the outputs of diagnostic equipment was developped based on and applied to specific locomotive type and its diesel engine. The methodology resulted in a significant reduction of the time for assessing the condition of the vehicle’s diesel engine and more effective maintenance.

The objective of this study is to prepare biodiesel blends of three types: (i) primary, (ii) binary and (iii) ternary, and investigate their behaviors to identify the optimal blends that produce the lowest emissions and adequate performance with no significant engine modifications. Experimental investigations carried out in this study indicate that by increasing biodiesel quantity in the blend, a rise in brake thermal efficiency and a marginal increase in brake specific fuel consumption were deduced. P30 blend was superior among the biodiesel blends, showing a maximum thermal efficiency of 36.83%. Biodiesel blends were reported to emit lower NOx emissions at higher loads and increased NOx at low loads compared to diesel. Culminated values of NOx were shown by CS30 (601 ppm); similarly, binary blend PJ30 showed a curtailed amount of NOx (497 ppm) at 20 N-m loading. Lower emissions of unburnt hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide are noticed for biodiesel blends with values lying in a range of 35–40 ppm and 0.04%, respectively, while the smoke emissions escalated for biodiesel blends reaching up to 76% for PJCS20.

Both buses met the Euro VI exhaust emission norm. The current strong drive to diversify fuels in Poland and the creation of a large gas port in Swinoujście for LNG imports creates an excellent opportunity to use this fuel, also in road transport. Therefore, the attempt to identify the emission in operation, in first place possible applications, i.e. an LNG bus, comparatively with the emission of a Diesel bus. The operational research carried out concerned such a bus and has not yet been carried out in the country, hence their innovation, also methodological. The conducted research, in particular, was aimed at verifying differences in exhaust emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The study was carried out on one urban bus route performing trips on consecutive days in similar environmental conditions. The performed tests were not strictly type approval tests but only used for comparative purposes. Hence, it was necessary to determine the compliance factor for the relevant exhaust gas substances, with the use of an evaluation algorithm based on measurement windows. Based on these results, the assumption regarding compliance with the emission requirements for the tested buses was verified in real traffic conditions. The exhaust emission values (emission indicators) determined in this way did not exceed the permissible emission limit values for carbon monoxide, while for nitrogen oxides and non-methane hydrocarbons certain exceedances were found. © 2021 Maciej Gis et al., published by De Gruyter 2021.","alternative fuels; city buses; exhaust emissions; real driving emissions",,"Pielecha, J.; Poznan University of Technology, Piotrowo Street 3, Poland; эл. почта: jacek.pielecha@put.poznan.pl",,"De Gruyter Open Ltd",23915439,,OEPNC,,"English","Open Eng.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101642883

Among them, the Grueneberg ganglion (GG) located in the anterior nasal region comprises sensory neurons activated by given substances. In rodents, in which the GG has been best studied, these chemical cues mainly include heterocyclic compounds released by predators or by conspecifics. Since some of these substances evoke fear- or stress-associated responses, the GG is considered as a detector for alerting semiochemicals. In fact, certain behavioral and physiological reactions to alarm pheromones and predator-secreted kairomones are attenuated in the absence of a functional GG. Intriguingly, GG neurons are also stimulated by cool temperatures. Moreover, ambient temperatures modulate olfactory responsiveness in the GG, indicating that cross-talks exist between the transduction pathways mediating chemo- and thermosensory signaling in this organ. In this context, exploring the relevant molecular cascades has demonstrated that some chemosensory transduction elements are also crucial for thermosensory signaling in the GG. Finally, for further processing of sensory information, axons of GG neurons project to the olfactory bulb of the brain where they innervate distinct glomerular structures belonging to the enigmatic necklace glomeruli. In this review, the stimuli activating GG neurons as well as the underlying transduction pathways are summarized. Because these stimuli do not exclusively activate GG neurons but also other sensory cells, the biological relevance of the GG is discussed, with a special focus on the role of the GG in detecting alarm signals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Chemosensory; Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel; Guanylyl cyclase; Necklace glomeruli; Olfaction","hormones and hormone analogs; pheromone; predator secreted kairomone; unclassified drug; axon; brain region; chemical structure; chemoreceptor; cooling; environmental temperature; ganglion; gene expression regulation; glomerulus; Grueneberg ganglion; hormone structure; human; molecular interaction; nerve projection; nerve stimulation; neurotransmission; nonhuman; olfactory bulb; olfactory nerve; olfactory system; priority journal; protein function; Review; signal processing; temperature sense","Fleischer, J.; Institute of Biology and Zoology, Germany; эл. почта: joerg.fleischer@zoologie.uni-halle.de",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",0302766X,,CTSRC,"33404842","English","Cell Tissue Res.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099212937

Generally, the Wide gives a drastic reduction of NOX emissions due to the vaporization of water particles in the combustion chamber results in lower combustion temperature. On the other side, the WiDE causes a decline in thermal efficiency due to its lower low heating value. The combination of methane and hydrogen (hythane) gas samples has been used as secondary fuel for getting the promising reduction of exhaust emissions without reduction of thermal efficiency of the engine. Initially, experiments are conducted with Wide fuel with water concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 15% and the rest of the diesel fuel by volume. The physicochemical properties of the prepared fuels were measured using ASTM standards. The base test results revealed that the WiDE10 is shown higher brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and lower exhaust emissions when contrasted with the other emulsified fuel samples. Later, the Wide10 emulsion fuel is further examined as the primary direct fuel along with hythane as a secondary fuel. The hythane fuel is prepared in two samples like hythane10 and hythane20 by means of methane and hydrogen percentage on an energy basis. The hythane fuel samples are supplied to the diesel engine at two flow rates like 4 liters per minute (lpm) and 5lpm. The maximum BTE was found of the WiDE10 with hythane20 at 5 lpm is 28.02% at full of load condition which is 5.69% of the higher when contrasted with the WiDE10 operation in a single fuel mode. The maximum in-cylinder pressure is found for the WiDE10 with hythane20 at a flow rate of 5lpm because of the higher hydrogen content shows the higher the flame speed results in improved combustion phenomena. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","combustion; dual-fuel mode; Emulsion; hythane; surfactant","ASTM standards; Diesel engines; Dual fuel engines; Emulsification; Gas emissions; Methane; Physicochemical properties; Brake thermal efficiency; Combustion phenomena; Combustion temperatures; Exhaust pollutants; In-cylinder pressures; Low heating values; Thermal efficiency; Water concentrations; Hydrogen fuels","Gopidesi, R.K.; Radha Krishna Gopidesi, India; эл. почта: krishnaab4u@gmail.com",,"Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.",15567036,,,,"English","Energy Sources Recovery Util.

This paper offers novel empirical guidance to policymakers considering investments in electric urban buses. We determine the environmental benefit of using electric buses rather than diesel or Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) for urban transit. For diesel and CNG we calculate air pollution damages by combining emission rates with damage valuations from the AP3 integrated assessment model and the social cost of carbon. For electric buses we calculate air pollution damages by combining the damage valuations with estimates of the marginal increase in emissions from electricity usage. The environmental benefit is positive on average across all counties in the contiguous U.S. when comparing electric to either diesel or CNG. The environmental benefit of operating an electric bus fleet (rather than diesel) is about $65 million per year in Los Angeles and above $10 million per year in six other MSAs. Including the environmental benefit, we calculate the net present value (NPV) of bus investment. Relative to diesel, the NPV benefit of an electric bus is positive in about two thirds of urban counties. Relative to CNG, the NPV benefit is negative in all counties. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Electricity; Environmental policy; Transit buses","Air pollution; Buses; Compressed natural gas; Damage detection; Diesel engines; Electric automobiles; Electric utilities; Environmental protection; Fleet operations; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Environmental benefits; Integrated assessment models; Social cost of carbon; Technological change; The net present value (NPV); Transportation electrifications; Transportation sector; Urban transportation; air quality; atmospheric pollution; bus transport; carbon emission; electric vehicle; electrification; environmental policy; natural gas; public transport; transportation policy; United States; Nucleopolyhedrovirus","Yates, A.J.; Department of Economics and Environment, CB 3305 University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, United States; эл. почта: ajyates@email.unc.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092455207

The objective of this paper was to summarise information and insights from ZEB implementations across the United States (U.S.) to advance the state of practice and facilitate transit agencies’ transition to ZEBs. Information was obtained through a critical review of relevant literature from peer-reviewed journals and agency reports released by transit agencies and other relevant stakeholders, an online survey of several transit agencies that implemented or are planning to implement ZEBs, and interviews with transit agency representatives and other relevant stakeholders. This review focuses on ZEB in-service performance, cost, fuelling, and implementation strategies. In addition, challenges and lessons learned as reported by U.S. transit agencies are described. A comparison among the three technologies and conventional fuel buses (i.e. diesel and compressed natural gas) suggests that ZEBs outperform conventional buses in terms of fuel efficiency, but their procurement cost is higher. Battery electric buses present the highest fuel efficiency and lowest procurement, operation, and maintenance costs, and have been chosen by most transit agencies followed by fuel cell battery electric buses. While fuel cell hybrid plug-in buses have been implemented by several agencies over the past ten years, they have not gained popularity due to increased purchase and maintenance costs. Important factors for agencies to consider when implementing any of these ZEB technologies include: (1) fleet size: starting with a small fleet and gradually expanding; (2) technology type: understanding the technology and properly choosing the one that matches the needs and limitations of a service area (e.g. available space, existing schedule) as well as available resources and agency goals; (3) staff training: proper training for a suitable amount of time of drivers and maintenance personnel; and (4) stakeholder collaboration: having an effective level of collaboration, cooperation, and support between stakeholders. Overall, ZEBs are a viable and promising approach for reducing emissions from transit fleets. This review can assist in transit agencies’ transition to ZEB fleets by providing useful information and insights to ensure optimal technology choice and efficient implementations. It can also provide insights on ZEB implementation issues that warrant further research. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","battery electric bus; fuel cell bus; fuel cell plug-in hybrid bus; transit agency; zero emissions; Zero-emission bus technology","bus transport; comparative study; electric vehicle; emission control; local participation; stakeholder; sustainability; transportation planning; United States","Christofa, E.; University of Massachusetts, 130 Natural Resources Road, United States; эл. почта: echristofa@engin.umass.edu",,"Routledge",01441647,,,,"English","Transp.

In addition, small alternative bioenergy sources are forced to compete disadvantageously with conventional energy supply, hindering their more extended exploitation. Thus, smart strategies to prove the environmental/economic potential of biogas and sludge produced in biological wastewater treatment systems (Bio-WWTs) are required to promote them as truly sustainable energy sources. In this view, the present study depicts a refined methodological framework for a more appropriate appraisal of Bio-WWTs promoting bioenergy recovery. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and emergy analysis (EmA) methods were merged around the statement of some identified and stated Principle–Criteria of Sustainability (PCS) for this kind of “water-energy nexus.” As a result, a novel set of four single sustainability development indicators (SDIs) and one aggregated SDI were obtained to address sustainable conditions for valorization of bio-energy from agro-industrial Bio-WWTs. These indicators were made up of an environmental term coming from an LCA based on a system expansion approach as well as a second or “eco-economic” term obtained by means of EmA. This work introduces and shapes the “additionality” notion as an expression of overall sustainability and uses novel sustainability charts to interpret the obtained SDIs and their shifting or changes for different Bio-WWTs’ life cycle scenarios. The “proof of concept” of this methodology is discussed along the obtained results for two case studies in Colombia. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agro-industrial wastewater; Biogas; Emergy; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Sustainability indicators; Water-energy nexus","alternative energy; bioreactor; emergy; life cycle analysis; sludge; sustainability; valorization; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; Colombia; animal; Colombia; life cycle stage; motivation; wastewater; water management; Animals; Colombia; Goals; Life Cycle Stages; Waste Water; Water Purification","Meneses-Jácome, A.; Ingeniería en Energía (Energy Engineering Department), Avenida 42 No. 48-11, Edificio L, Oficina 2do.

Algae are a diverse collection of oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms with rapid growth capacity that utilise commonly available materials for growth. Biological CO2 mitigation using microalgae is an environmentally friendly and economical method. Besides this, algae are able to live in extreme environments containing high amounts of heavy metals, making this a useful way to treat wastewater. The biomass produced from algae also can be used as a source of energy, chemicals and food. However, to ensure that the optimum blooming capacity is reached for the production of high-yield biomass for bioenergy resources, growth factors such as absorbed CO2, nutrient availability, light energy, temperature, pH and agitation should be studied comprehensively.

To enhance rigor and reproducibility in task-based research, it is advantageous to have stimulus sets that are publicly available and well characterized. Food Folio by Columbia Center for Eating Disorders is a publicly available set of 138 images of Western food items. The set was developed for the study of eating disorders, particularly for use in tasks that capture eating behavior characteristic of these illnesses. It contains foods that are typically eaten, as well as those typically avoided, by individuals with eating disorders. Each image has now been rated across 17 different attributes by a large general United States population sample via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (n = 1054). Ratings included subjective attributes (e.g., tastiness, healthiness, and favorable texture) as well as estimates of nutrient content (e.g., fat and carbohydrate). Each participant rated a subset of stimulus set food items (46 foods) on all 17 dimensions. Additional description of the image set is provided in terms of physical image information and accurate nutritional information. Correlations between subjective ratings were calculated and an exploratory factor analysis and exploratory cluster analysis completed. Outcomes of the factor analysis suggested foods may be described along three latent factors of healthiness, tastiness, and umami taste; the cluster analysis highlighted five distinct clusters of foods varying on these same dimensions. Descriptive outcomes indicated that the stimulus set includes a range of foods that vary along multiple dimensions and thus is likely to be useful in addressing various research questions surrounding eating behavior and cognition in healthy populations, as well as in those with eating disorders. The provision of comprehensive descriptive information allows for stimulus selection that is optimized for a given research question and promotes strong inference. © Copyright © 2020 Lloyd, Shehzad, Schebendach, Bakkour, Xue, Assaf, Jilani, Walsh, Steinglass and Foerde.","cognition; eating; eating behavior; eating disorders; food; image; stimulus set",,"Lloyd, E.C.; Department of Psychiatry, United States; эл. почта: caitlin.lloyd@nyspi.columbia.edu

The white-eye genus Zosterops is a classical example of a ‘great speciator’, comprising c. 100 species from across the Old World, most of them insular. We achieved an extensive geographic DNA sampling of Zosterops by using historical specimens and recently collected samples. Using over 700 genome-wide loci in conjunction with coalescent species tree methods and gene flow detection approaches, we untangled the reticulated evolutionary history of Zosterops, which comprises three main clades centered in Indo-Africa, Asia, and Australasia, respectively. Genetic introgression between species permeates the Zosterops phylogeny, regardless of how distantly related species are. Crucially, we identified the Indonesian archipelago, and specifically Borneo, as the major center of diversity and the only area where all three main clades overlap, attesting to the evolutionary importance of this region. © Gwee et al.",,"Africa; article; Australia and New Zealand; Borneo; cladistics; eye; gene flow; human tissue; introgression; phylogenomics; phylogeny; animal; genetics; Indonesia; phylogeny; songbird; species differentiation; Animals; Gene Flow; Genetic Speciation; Indonesia; Phylogeny; Songbirds","Rheindt, F.E.; National University of Singapore, Singapore; эл. почта: dbsrfe@nus.edu.sg",,"eLife Sciences Publications Ltd",2050084X,,,"33350381","English","eLife",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099310983

The research question in this study is: how can we assess the main indicators of public transport’s competitiveness, which can motivate personal car owners with specific basic values to change the transportation mode for personal mobility? This conceptual research model combines the content analysis of publications and large-scale online survey of Moscow City’s car owners—potential consumers of public transport services—on a representative quota sample of 1263 respondents. The methodology includes the axiological approach for the identification of the main factors of consumer behavior of personal car owners in the city with combinations of the modified Schwartz’s methodology of the basic individual values evaluations. Secondary data manifested the changes in the behavior of car owners due to the fact that they value metropolitan environmental degradation and changed their transportation preferences to public transport even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the factor and cluster analysis of the value profile of the individuals, seven clusters of car owners were identified, and two large clusters were selected as target segments for public transport services. The conclusion was made that it is necessary to differentiate social and marketing programs to promote the competitiveness of public transport in the minds of consumers. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, various studies have investigated the growth of renewable energy in Malaysia, most commonly based on biogas and hydropower. In this article, the dynamics of Malaysia’s renewable energy development is critically examined by using the latest official national reports and other reliable resources. Results: The study reveals the influencing factors that shape renewable energy growth in a developing country endowed with substantial biomass resources, such as Malaysia. Likewise, it evaluates the evolution of renewable energy in the electricity sector. In 2017, renewable energy represented about 3.5% of the Malaysian electricity generation mix with 1122 MW of installed capacity. A closer look into the renewable energy resources, i.e. biomass, biogas, solar and small hydro power, revealed that over 47% of the grid-connected power generation came from solar photovoltaic (PV) energy. While solar PV capacity continues to accelerate, the development of other renewable resources, especially biomass, is seeing growth at a significantly slower pace. This article investigates the underlying causes of the skewed development rate as well as the potential strategies that may be adopted to promote a diversification of renewable energy resources. In light of this, introduction of a new national bioenergy policy is proposed, through which four essential programmes could be implemented: (i) enhanced bioenergy conversion efficiency and waste management, (ii) biomass co-firing in coal power plants, (iii) conversion of biogas to biomethane and bio-compressed natural gas (bio-CNG), (iv) large-scale biomass power plants. A total of 4487 MW of additional power could be connected to the grid upon successful implementation of a large-scale biomass power plant programme. Conclusions: The establishment of a comprehensive and inclusive national bioenergy policy will lead towards a sustainable future of renewable energy development in Malaysia. © 2020, The Author(s).","Biogas; Biomass; Co-firing; Electricity; Energy policy; Large-scale power plant; Renewable energy","Biogas; Climate change; Compressed natural gas; Developing countries; Ecology; Electric power transmission networks; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Natural gasoline plants; Palm oil; Planning; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Sustainable development; Waste management; Biomass power plants; Climate change mitigation; Electricity generation; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy source; Renewable resource; Solar photovoltaics; Substantial biomass; Biomass","Salleh, S.F.; Institute of Energy Policy and Research (IEPRe), Malaysia; эл. почта: Siti.Fatihah@uniten.edu.my",,"BioMed Central Ltd",21920567,,,,"English","Energy Sustainability Soc.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094631542

By promoting or impeding sperm velocity, females can control fertilization via postcopulatory cryptic female choice. In Chinook salmon, ovarian fluid (OF), which surrounds the ova, mediates sperm velocity according to male and female identity, biasing the outcome of sperm competition towards males with faster sperm. Past investigations have revealed proteome variation in OF, but the specific components of OF that differentially mediate sperm velocity have yet to be characterized. Here we use quantitative proteomics to investigate whether OF protein composition explains variation in sperm velocity and fertilization success. We found that OF proteomes from six females robustly clustered into two groups and that these groups are distinguished by the abundance of a restricted set of proteins significantly associated with sperm velocity. Exposure of sperm to OF from females in group I had faster sperm compared to sperm exposed to the OF of group II females. Overall, OF proteins that distinguished between these groups were enriched for vitellogenin and calcium ion interactions. Our findings suggest that these proteins may form the functional basis for cryptic female choice via the biochemical and physiological mediation of sperm velocity. © 2020 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

These stakeholders continue to tackle disruptions to supply chain systems through the introduction of strategy options for resilience. A better understanding of broader dimensions of potential disruptions to supply chains caused by uncertainties has become eminent, especially as currently experienced during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the outbreak in disrupting supply chains in the energy sector will, in the next decade, continue to be a likely concern for industry and research stakeholders. Balancing the increasing need for energy security to meet the continuous growth in energy demand through shortage reduction and increased uptime using optimization is the core of this research. This review paper provides an insight into recent studies in the field of natural gas supply chain resilience as a major player in the energy mix, and the continued disruption and subsequent shutdowns of plant nodes, which results in emission loss to the environment. This paper is motivated by the disparity between demand and supply triggered by the disruption of supply chain networks. Referenced in this paper are scientific work on supply chain resilience of biomass, water, power systems, and natural gas. Findings show that existing studies favor fewer system-based strategies in optimizing for resilience. This review concludes that an optimization is a useful tool to continuously achieve resilience in supply chain production, storage, and transportation activities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Disruption; Energy; Natural gas; Optimization; Resilience; Supply chain; Uncertainty","Energy policy; Energy security; Gas supply; Natural gas fields; Natural gasoline plants; Plant shutdowns; Demand and supply; Energy demands; Energy sector; Energy supply chains; Review papers; Supply chain network; Supply chain resiliences; Supply chain systems; Supply chains","Emenike, S.N.; University of Glasgow, United Kingdom; эл. почта: s.emenike.1@research.gla.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090948361

During its growth and development, different types of wastes are produced through agricultural, industrial, and anthropogenic activities besides increase in energy demand to keep its pace of growth to become a developed nation. Various strategies like landfill, incineration, gasification, and anaerobic digestion (AD) are available to treat as well as to produce energy from the wastes. Production of biogas through AD is one of the best available options due to low energy requirement and eco-friendly nature as compared with other methods. In India, waste to the energy sector may project to a market size of 14 billion ~USD by 2025 with an annual increase of around 7%. In order to capture this untapped source of energy scientific management of waste along with Government policies, schemes and incentives for waste management, renewable energy, agriculture, etc. and their implementations are crucial cornerstones for the promotion of biogas technology and to get renewable energy on sustainable basis. But still a number of challenges are being faced by its stakeholders in India to transform wastes into energy and to secure a clean and green future. Production process of gaseous fuels, management of wastes, its logistics, and recent advancements in Govt. policies and schemes are being discussed in this review article that may help its stakeholders to make India self-reliance in renewable energy along with sustainable growth and development.

Prolonged exposure to cAMP causes calmodulin-dependent feedback-adaptation of CNG channels and attenuates neural responses. On the other hand, the odour-source searching behaviour requires ORNs to be sensitive to odours when approaching targets. How ORNs accommodate these conflicting aspects of cAMP responses remains unknown. Here, we discover that olfactory marker protein (OMP) is a major cAMP buffer that maintains the sensitivity of ORNs. Upon the application of sensory stimuli, OMP directly captured and swiftly reduced freely available cAMP, which transiently uncoupled downstream CNG channel activity and prevented persistent depolarization. Under repetitive stimulation, OMP-/- ORNs were immediately silenced after burst firing due to sustained depolarization and inactivated firing machinery. Consequently, OMP-/- mice showed serious impairment in odour-source searching tasks. Therefore, cAMP buffering by OMP maintains the resilient firing of ORNs. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"cyclic AMP; limonene; olfactory marker protein; butorphanol; cyclic AMP; cyclic nucleotide gated channel; fragrance; medetomidine; midazolam; olfactory marker protein; buffering; cation; cell; induced response; olfactory cue; polarization; protein; sensory system; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; cAMP signaling; controlled study; firing rate; human; human cell; hyposmia; loose patch clamp; male; mechanical stimulation; mouse; nerve cell membrane steady potential; nerve cell stimulation; nonhuman; odor; olfactory receptor neuron; physical sensitivity; protein binding; sensory stimulation; animal; C57BL mouse; cilium; cytology; drug effect; genetics; HEK293 cell line; knockout mouse; membrane potential; metabolism; olfactory mucosa; olfactory receptor neuron; patch clamp technique; physiology; Mus; Animals; Butorphanol; Cilia; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Medetomidine; Membrane Potentials; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Midazolam; Odorants; Olfactory Marker Protein; Olfactory Mucosa; Olfactory Receptor Neurons; Patch-Clamp Techniques","Nakashima, N.; Department of Physiology, 67 Asahi-machi, Japan; эл. почта: nakashima_noriyuki@med.kurume-u.ac.jp",,"Nature Research",20411723,,,"32366818","English","Nat.

The features of modeling gas exchange processes based on gas dynamics equations are shown. The parameters of the gas flow are calculated by three conservation laws obtained by applying the general laws of physics to the elementary mass released in the flow, followed by a transition to the limit when the volume occupied by this mass tends to zero: momentum, mass, and energy. A mathematical model of the working process in the engine cylinder is created by the necessary conditions for calculating the entire gas exchange. Using a computer allows for a more accurate and complete description of all the main features. In the foreground is not the complexity and volume of calculations, but the accuracy of approximating the processes of fresh charge entering the engine cylinders, the air flow in the intake tract, the possibility of a comprehensive study of the effect on the filling process of each of the parameters of the intake tract design and gas distribution, and the features of the engine operation mode under study.

When evaluating engine filling, it is necessary to evaluate the boundary conditions at the time of opening the intake valve and the effective passage area in the channel neck, which, together with the valve lift, is the determining size in the gas distribution mechanism. The numerical values are a function of the ratio of the current valve displacement to the neck diameter. The filling losses associated with the heating of the air charge from the walls and the partial conversion of the kinetic charge into heat are estimated by the losses ?T. This value of the temperature increase when filling the internal combustion engine is made for the mode of the spring speed characteristic. Changes in the charge pressure at the end of the inlet are estimated by the loss of part of the kinetic energy with the transition to potential energy due to charge deceleration. The paper evaluates the gas injection from the cylinder into the intake system at partial loads due to an increase in the valve overlap zone. Which ultimately reduces the filling factor. Data are given on the increase in the filling coefficient due to the pre-charging process due to the expansion of the delay phase of the intake valve closing. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Estimation; Filling; Gas dynamics; Intake valves; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Potential energy; Quality control; Charging process; Dynamic factors; Gas distribution; Intake valve closings; Numerical values; Speed characteristics; Temperature increase; Valve displacement; Engine cylinders","Zholobov, L.A.; Department of Exploitation of Mobile Power Vehicles and Agricultural Machinery, Gagarin prospect 97, Russian Federation; эл. почта: jolobovlev@yandex.ru","Kovalev I.V.Voroshilova A.A.Testoyedov N.A.","IOP Publishing Ltd",17426588,,,,"English","J.

The emissions at two typical engine steady-state operating points were also added for comparison. Meanwhile, the engine working status was monitored during the whole trip. The results indicate that the small throttle opening and the rich air/fuel ratio make the very low engine combustion efficiency during cold-start phase, which leads to higher THC and CO emissions. During this stage, the CO2 is also high due to the absolutely high fuel consumption rather than the high combustion efficiency, due to the low NOx emission. By comparing this studied engine to others, the direction to improve the transient response especially under low loads was found. Compared with steady-state operation, both CO and CO2 during transient driving are lower, because at transient driving the combustion temperature is lower, leading to lower products amounts for those CO precursor (especially for HCO). The lower combustion temperature also leads to lower NOx emission, and the incomplete combustion leads to higher THC emission at cycle driving.

The most frequently reported negative impact is a deterioration in urban air quality. In this study, we performed a comprehensive assessment of the effects of the city lockdown policy in response to Covid-19 on air quality in Shanghai Municipality, China, and sought to identify a balance point between human activities and improving air quality. The first-level response (FLR) by Shanghai to control the spread of Covid-19 was to launch a lockdown, which remained in place from 24 January to 23 March, 2020. We compared airborne pollutant concentrations in different regions (downtown, suburbs) of Shanghai city in three periods (Pre-FLR, During-FLR, and Post-FLR) and in the corresponding periods in the previous year. The results showed that air quality improved significantly During-FLR compared with Pre-FLR, with the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO all decreasing significantly. The concentrations of all pollutants except O3 also decreased significantly compared with the same period in the previous year. There were also some differences in pollutant concentrations between the downtown region and the suburbs of Shanghai. However, we found that the concentrations of pollutants rebounded gradually when the restrictions on human activities ended after two months of lockdown. This study provides empirical evidence of the important effect of limiting human activities on air quality. For sustainable and clean future urban management in Shanghai and beyond, central government policy regulations requiring a low-carbon lifestyle and cleaner production in industries should be established. © 2020 by the authors.

We apply the integrated assessment model MEDEAS-World to study four global transportation decarbonization strategies for 2050. The results show that a massive replacement of oil-fueled individual vehicles to electric ones alone cannot deliver GHG reductions consistent with climate stabilization and could result in the scarcity of some key minerals, such as lithium and magnesium. In addition, energy-economy feedbacks within an economic growth system create a rebound effect that counters the benefits of substitution. The only strategy that can achieve the objectives globally follows the Degrowth paradigm, combining a quick and radical shift to lighter electric vehicles and non-motorized modes with a drastic reduction in total transportation demand. © 2020 The Authors","Decarbonization; Degrowth; Electric vehicles; Energy transition; Lithium","Decarbonization; Economic analysis; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum transportation; Climate stabilization; Economic growths; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Integrated assessment models; Non-motorized modes; Rebound effect; Technical limitations; Transportation demand; Nonmotorized transportation","de Blas, I.; Group of Energy, Spain; эл. почта: ignaciodeblas@eii.uva.es",,"Elsevier Ltd",2211467X,,,,"English","Energy Strateg.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction remain unknown. In this follow-up study, marine medaka embryos were exposed to 0 and 3.3 mg/L of PFBS under normoxia (6.9 mg/L) or hypoxia (1.7 mg/L) condition till 15 days post-fertilization. High-throughput transcriptomic sequencing was employed to filter differentially expressed genes and provide mechanistic insight into interactive action between hypoxia and PFBS. The results showed that hypoxia alone and the coexposure paradigm were similarly potent to modify transcriptional profiles, with the majority of genes significantly down-regulated. In contrast, transcriptional toxicity of PFBS was relatively milder. Functional annotation analyses found that hypoxia and coexposure groups mainly impacted phototransduction signaling by decreasing the transcriptions of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channels and retinol transport genes. However, this study demonstrated the first toxicological evidence that toxic effects of PFBS targeted the perception of chemical stimulus through olfactory and gustatory receptors. The addition of PFBS moderately exacerbated the toxic actions of hypoxia, which largely shaped the transcriptional pattern of coexposure group. In addition, gene interactive networks were constructed for hypoxia and coexposure groups, underlining the increased chromatin deacetylation and methylation to epigenetically repress genome-wide transcriptional initiation. Overall, PFBS and hypoxia interact to interrupt the embryonic development of sensory systems, which may compromise the individual fitness and survival, especially during early life stages when precocious perception of food and escape from predators are essential. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","DNA remodeling; Hypoxia; Marine medaka embryo; PFBS; Sensory system; Transcriptome","Acetylation; Alkylation; Fiber optic chemical sensors; Nucleotides; Topography; Toxicity; Transcription; Developmental toxicity; Differentially expressed gene; Embryonic development; Environmental pollutants; Functional annotation; Molecular mechanism; Post-fertilization; Transcriptional initiation; Sensory perception; perflubutane; perfluorobutane sulfonate; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; perflubutane; chemical pollutant; embryonic development; fertilization (reproduction); finfish; genome; hypoxic conditions; marine pollution; perception; sensory system; topography; toxicology; adult; agar gel electrophoresis; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; chromatin; concentration (parameter); controlled study; down regulation; embryo; environmental temperature; fertilization; follow up; gene expression; high throughput sequencing; limit of quantitation; nonhuman; olfactory receptor; Oryzias melastigma; phototransduction; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; taste bud; toxicity testing; transcriptomics; animal; chromatin; hypoxia; nonmammalian embryo; Oryzias; water pollutant; Oryziinae; Animals; Chromatin; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Fluorocarbons; Follow-Up Studies; Hypoxia; Oryzias; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Chen, L.; State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, China; эл. почта: lchenam@ihb.ac.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",02697491,,ENPOE,"32781212","English","Environ.

Although it has been almost 150 years since the introduction of internal combustion engine, researches seeking engineering solutions still continue. Driving quality, performance and fuel economy have been improved while emissions have been lowered significantly. But there has not been any unified analytical model that can capture the internal combustion engine as a complete system from thermodynamic, mechanical or chemical perspective per se. With experimental research methods usually too involving in terms of engineering costs, computational approaches to deliver numerical solutions have been inevitable as a research methodology – or even sometimes, is left as the only feasible method. In light of these concerns, this article reviews a few trending modelling methods of (1) analytical, (2) regression and (3) artificial neural network methods, and optimisation methods of (1) response surface methodology, (2) Taguchi method and (3) genetic algorithm which have been popularly employed in internal combustion engine research.

Nowadays manufacturers take shifts from manual operations to automation with consideration of productivity in man-hour, accuracy; timely delivery, safety, better finish, etc. The procurement of new machines or equipment or systems demands more investment. The case study was conducted in a leading valve manufacturing company. This research focuses on the valve end grinding operation. The following difficulties were exercised in loading and unloading of valves in the machine due to limited operator. That is the maximum stress for the workers in the loading and unloading process, further the time taken for the process is more, which affects the production rate. Accuracy of setting often error which causes rejection based on variation in critical parameters. In addition the safety for the workers involved in this process is very less. So in order to overcome the above difficulties, there is a need to design a more flexible system which will take care of the process and reduce the stress of the workers. The safety factor must also be concerned with the design. It was ensured that the proposed system increases the productivity, quality, accuracy, safety and comfort. © 2020 Author(s).",,,"Sathish, T.; Dept. of Mech.

The impact of improvement is very high if its application is high or its significant effects on tangible and intangible benefits. This research identified a part in the automobile clutch system which replaces a massive amount of components from its instantaneous precursor, spring of coil type and clutch cover of lever-type. Such component is none other than solo type diaphragm spring. Its cost is less due to its determined complication in shape and manufacturability. In most cases the mass of the component is the issue in automobile and in particularly such sensitive component of solo type diaphragm spring. Hence here it is focused for material validation.

Mechatronics play an important role in meeting such requirements, because ""Quality is Free"". With this aim the processes are studied for optimizing work method and time. The optimization of work method can be done by reducing work content by improving the processing methods and the time can be optimized by automating the process. This systematic approach of process improvement is illustrated with a case study. The case study has been carried out in a leading car manufacturing industry (Ford India Limited) The process is improved by designing a mechanism and was mechanized by applying Mechatronics concepts for obtaining higher accuracy and quick processing.

Business success increasingly depends upon sustainable innovation. Observing recent innovation best practices, the emergence of a new paradigm is traceable. Creating an innovative ecosystem has a multilayer effect: It contributes to regional digitalization, technological start-up emergence, open innovation promotion, and new policy enhancement retro-feeding the system. Public policy must create open innovation environments accordingly with the quintuple helix harmonizing the ecosystem to internalize emerging spillovers.

In this sense, the aim of this study is to present how open innovation can enhance sustainable innovation ecosystems and boost the digital transition. For that, firstly, a diachronic perspective of the sustainable innovation ecosystem is traced, its connection to open innovation, and identification of the university linkages. Secondly, database exploration and econometric estimations are performed. Then, we will ascertain how far open innovation frameworks and in particular the knowledge flows unveiled by the university promote smart and responsible innovation cycles.

Although these engines comply with the Tier III NOx emissions regulations when operating at the gas mode, additional measures are required to ensure such compliance at the diesel mode. Hence, this study aimed to optimise the settings of a marine four-stroke dual fuel (DF) engine equipped with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and air bypass (ABP) systems by employing simulation and optimisation techniques, so that the engine when operating at the diesel mode complies with the ‘Tier III’ requirements. A previous version of the engine thermodynamic model was extended to accommodate the EGR and ABP systems modelling. Subsequently, a combination of optimisation techniques including multiobjective genetic algorithms (MOGA) and design of experiments (DoE) parametric runs was employed to identify both the engine and the EGR/ABP systems settings with the objective to minimise the engine brake specific fuel consumption and reduce the NOx emissions below the Tier III limit. The derived simulation results were employed to analyse the EGR system involved interactions and their effects on the engine performance and emissions trade-offs. A sensitivity analysis was performed to reveal the interactions between considered engine settings and quantify their impact on the engine performance parameters. The derived results indicate that EGR rates up to 35% are required, so that the investigated engine with EGR and ABP systems, when operating at the diesel mode, achieves compliance with the ‘Tier III’ NOx emissions, whereas the associated engine brake specific fuel consumption penalty is up to 8.7%. This study demonstrates that the combination of EGR and ABP systems can constitute a functional solution for achieving compliance with the stringent regulatory requirements and provides a better understating of the underlined phenomena and interactions of the engine subsystems parameters variations for the investigated engine equipped with EGR and ABP systems. © 2020 by the authors.","Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and air bypass (ABP) systems; Marine dual fuel engine; Multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and design of experiments (DoE) optimisation; Performance-emissions trade-offs; Thermodynamic modelling","Brakes; Bypass ratio; Design of experiments; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuels; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Marine engines; Multiobjective optimization; Nitrogen oxides; Regulatory compliance; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Environmental sustainability; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Functional solution; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Optimisation techniques; Parameters variations; Regulatory requirements; Thermodynamic model; Dual fuel engines","Theotokatos, G.; Maritime Safety Research Centre, 100 Montrose Street, United Kingdom; эл. почта: gerasimos.theotokatos@strath.ac.uk",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092433203

The scenarios compared consider conventional containerisation systems, underground containerisation and pneumatic collection/transport systems. The results show that pneumatic systems have a greater impact on climate change, acidification, particulate matter and stratospheric ozone depletion due to their significant electricity consumption and the environmental impact of pipelines manufacture. However, in relation to terrestrial eutrophication and photochemical ozone formation, underground containers exhibit a greater impact. A general sensitivity analysis was carried out, for all of the scenarios analysed, and a specific one for the pneumatic scenario. Results show that the environmental impact of pneumatic systems and underground containerization is higher than that of conventional systems. These results are completely determined by the consumption of materials (in the two cases) and energy (for pneumatic scenario). This environmental conclusion has to be taken into account for policy making in urban areas, along with other social and economic aspects. In terms of climate change, the comparison allows us to conclude that pneumatic systems have a carbon footprint 119% higher than the lowest impact scenario (side-loading containers located in drop-off-points). Among the conventional pre-collection and collection/transport scenarios, the one with the greatest carbon footprint is the one that uses underground containers; 16% higher than the scenario with side-loading containers located at drop-off-points. Among the scenarios that use conventional containers on the surface, the door-to-door scenario has the greatest impact. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Collection and transport; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste; Pneumatic systems; Underground containers","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Containers; Decision making; Drops; Ecodesign; Emission control; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Ozone; Ozone layer; Packaging; Pneumatic control; Pneumatic equipment; Sensitivity analysis; Conventional systems; Decision making tool; Electricity-consumption; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Particulate Matter; Photochemical ozone; Stratospheric ozone depletion; Life cycle; climate change; decision making; design; eutrophication; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; photochemistry; sensitivity analysis; transport process; waste disposal; acidification; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; decision making; electricity; energy consumption; environmental impact; environmental policy; eutrophication; human; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; ozone layer; particulate matter; photochemistry; pipeline; pneumatic system; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomics; underground system; urban area; waste and waste related phenomena; waste disposal","Pérez, J.; Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, C/ José Gutiérrez Abascal, 2, Spain; эл. почта: javier.perez@etsii.upm.es",,"Elsevier B.V.",09213449,,RCREE,,"English","Resour.

Bicarbonate and calcium present in the female reproductive tract trigger capacitation in sperm, leading to acrosomal responsiveness and hyperactivated motility. Male decapacitating factors present in the semen avert premature capacitation, until detached from the sperm surface. However, their mechanism of action remains elusive. Here we describe for the first time the molecular basis for the decapacitating action of the seminal protein SPINK3 in mouse sperm. When present in the capacitating medium, SPINK3 inhibited Src kinase, a modulator of the potassium channel responsible for plasma membrane hyperpolarization. Lack of hyperpolarization affected calcium channels activity, impairing the acquisition of acrosomal responsiveness and blocking hyperactivation. Interestingly, SPINK3 acted only on non-capacitated sperm, as it did not bind to capacitated cells. Binding selectivity allows its decapacitating action only in non-capacitated sperm, without affecting capacitated cells. © Copyright © 2020 Zalazar, Stival, Nicolli, De Blas, Krapf and Cesari.","decapacitation factor; fertilization; membrane potential hyperpolarization; sperm capacitation; SPINK3","calcium channel; seminal plasma protein; seminal protein spink3; unclassified drug; acrosome reaction; Article; calcium cell level; calcium transport; cell membrane; hyperpolarization; incubation time; male; membrane potential; mouse; nonhuman; sperm; spermatozoon capacitation","Cesari, A.; Instituto de Investigaciones Biológicas (IIB), Argentina; эл. почта: acesari@mdp.edu.ar

Particularly the triggers for the molecular machinery, which recalls either the male or female developmental program, are highly variable and have evolved independently and repeatedly. Fish show a huge variety of sex determination systems, including both genetic and environmental triggers. The advent of sex chromosomes is assumed to stabilize genetic sex determination. However, because sex chromosomes are notoriously cluttered with repetitive DNA and pseudogenes, the study of their evolution is hampered. Here we reconstruct the birth of a Y chromosome present in the Atlantic herring. The region is tiny (230 kb) and contains only three intact genes. The candidate male-determining gene BMPR1BBY encodes a truncated form of a BMP1B receptor, which originated by gene duplication and translocation and underwent rapid protein evolution. BMPR1BBY phosphorylates SMADs in the absence of ligand and thus has the potential to induce testis formation. The Y region also contains two genes encoding subunits of the sperm-specific Ca2+ channel CatSper required for male fertility. The herring Y chromosome conforms with a characteristic feature of many sex chromosomes, namely, suppressed recombination between a sex-determining factor and genes that are beneficial for the given sex. However, the herring Y differs from other sex chromosomes in that suppression of recombination is restricted to an ∼500-kb region harboring the male-specific and sex-associated regions. As a consequence, any degeneration on the herring Y chromosome is restricted to those genes located in the small region affected by suppressed recombination. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Considered as such are city bus with engines fuelled with LNG and hybrid bus. This article, as shown above, provides a comparison of road exhaust emissions from three city buses: one with a CI engine fuelled with diesel fuel, and the other with a SI engine fuelled with LNG and Hybrid bus. Both vehicles (CI and LNG) conformed to Euro VI emission standard (hybrid bus EEV), and the tests were carried out in real traffic conditions. Equivocal opinions about differences in emissions from those types of buses, among others - CO2 and NOx emissions, were the underlying cause of the tests. The comparative study was carried out along the same urban routes during bus trips over the following days in similar traffic conditions. Exhaust road emission was determined based on the vehicle's curb weight and route length, and operating fuel consumption. Also, the study was consistent with the most requirements laid down in the regulation regarding estimates of fuel consumption consistency ratio during road tests from heavy-duty vehicles. For that reason, it was necessary to determine the conformity factor for relevant exhaust sub-stances in exhaust gases in window functions, based on which the assumption on the fulfilment of emission requirements for three buses in real traffic conditions was verified. The values thus established of emissions of exhaust substances from exhaust gases in tested city buses did practically not exceed permissible limit CO values, while for NOx and NMHC there are some exceedances.

HFC is mostly used in passenger cars and urban buses. HFC technology is also being introduced to railway transport. Hydrogen-powered trains are an attractive alternative to diesel trains, in particular on nonelectrified railways-where roughly 70% of the world's 200 000 locomotives operate today-and in the markets of Europe and the US (together about 55 000 diesel locomotives today). Besides avoiding carbon emissions, hydrogen trains reduce noise and eliminate local emissions of NOX and particulates. Since they use significant amounts of hydrogen, the required infrastructure is limited and can be immediately utilised. Hydrogen-powered trains are already being introduced for light-rail vehicles and regional railways-such as the trams produced by the China South Rail Corporation. Other models, including regional trains by Alstom, are expected to be deployed in the coming years. By 2030, one in ten trains sold for currently nonelectrified railways could be powered by hydrogen, by 2050, one in five trains running on nonelectrified railways or one in ten trains overall could run on fuel cells. Presently, two Coradia Lint trains are operated in Germany. In Poland by the end of 2018, 19 235 km of railways were used, of which 7 341 km (38%) were nonelectrified lines, mostly single-Track (63%). Commodity transport was performed with 1470 electrical locomotives, 2070 diesel locomotives and 170 other rail transport vehicles. The objective of the article is to analyse the rationality of introducing HFC technology in Poland e.g. in terms of reduced CO2 emissions, based on current French, Romania, Spanish and Dutch experiences in multiple units and Latvian, German and Polish in shunters or Estonian, German and Swedish in mainline locomotives. The case study presented in this article focuses primarily on reducing CO2 emissions from Multiple Units. © 2020 SAE International.

The study was performed by using life cycle assessment in accordance with international standard ISO 14040/44 for assessing the CO2 eq., SO2, and PM10 of the transportation means by exploiting data (i.e., vehicles features and environmental impacts) from 24 scientific papers from the literature that have been manually analyzed. The functional unit is defined as the impact per 1 passenger over 1 km. The study identified that planes are the most impacting for CO2 eq. with up to 380 g/pkm, while cars are the most impacting for SO2 with up to 1.78 g/pkm and PM10 with 0.98 g/pkm. Electric and hybrid models proved to be significantly better than others, while buses are the most sustainable in general. Referring to the overall European scenario, cars constitute up to 95% of the overall impacts. By comparing some improvements for reducing the impacts, it emerged that the limitation of diesel cars along with the increase of buses and trains are the most eoffective. The provided outcomes may be useful for legislators, manufacturers, and users for favoring the choice of the transportation means in a more environmentally conscious way. © 2020 by the authors.","Electric transportation; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Transportation impact","bus transport; car use; data interpretation; diesel engine; electric vehicle; environmental impact assessment; European Union; life cycle analysis; literature review; transportation infrastructure","Spreafico, C.; Department of Management Information and Production Engineering, Italy; эл. почта: christian.spreafico@unibg.it",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091163360

As an extremely ICT innovation, building information modelling (BIM) not only brings technical benefits to the AEC industry, but changes the innovation paradigm of the AEC industry towards an innovation ecosystem, which improve productivity and sustainability throughout the project life cycle. This article contributes to innovation ecosystem theory by exploring the structure of the BIM ecosystem and deriving its cultivation path. Then, as the leading city in China for developing BIM technologies, Shanghai was selected as the case study to elaborate on the cultivation path of the BIM ecosystem. The results indicate that three layers identified in the structure contribute to the understanding of the boundaries, units, and analytical focus of the BIM ecosystem, with the BIM platform being the core layer. This topology structure, with the BIM platform as the hub, promotes interdependency and symbiosis among participants in the cultivation of the BIM ecosystem, supporting the birth, expansion, maturity, re-innovation (or extinction), and sustainable development of the BIM ecosystem. This research complements and extends literature on the BIM ecosystem, and provides implications as to the construction, cultivation, and sustainability of BIM ecosystems for emerging economy firms. © 2020 by the authors.","Architecture engineering and construction (AEC) industry; Building information modelling (BIM); Cultivation; Ecosystem; Sustainability","building; construction industry; innovation; life cycle analysis; perception; sustainability; sustainable development; topology; China; Shanghai","Zhang, Y.; College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, China; эл. почта: 3130102512@zju.edu.cn",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090834580

While existing literature has explored how a hub firm develops or manages an innovation ecosystem, little attention has been paid to the strategic challenges in the development and management process. In strategic management, managerial cognitive capability has been proposed as a key factor that influences how firms make strategic changes and adapt to dynamic environments. Hence, from the perspective of managerial cognitive capability, this paper strives to investigate the development of an innovation ecosystem from the perspective of managerial cognitive capability. To do so, we conducted a qualitative case study of Xiaomi's innovation ecosystem from 2010 to 2019. The research adopts an interpretive approach and finds that (1) the evolution of the innovation ecosystem can be divided into incubation, growth, and regeneration periods, with developing core products, related products, and unrelated products as respective focus; (2) under rapid technological and market changes, it is critical to match the managerial cognitive capability of the hub-firm with its innovation ecosystem; (3) building innovation ecosystems enables the hub-firm to achieve sustainable competitive advantages. The study builds a model for the growth of innovation ecosystems and enriches theoretical research on innovation ecosystems and managerial cognitive capability. © 2020 by the authors.","Case study; Innovation ecosystems; Managerial cognitive capability; Strategic transformation; Xiaomi","cognition; competition (economics); innovation; leadership; market development; multinational enterprise; strategic approach; sustainability; technological development","Zhang, S.; School of Economics and Management, China; эл. почта: sixuan_zhang@buaa.edu.cn",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090464602

Sustainable development clashes with the transport sector because of the latter's high fossil fuels usage, consumption of natural resources and emission of pollutant and greenhouse gases. Electric mobility seems to be one of the best options to achieve both the sustainability goals and the mobility needs. This paper critically analysed weaknesses, strengths and application fields of electric mobility, proposing a real case application of an e-mobility bus fleet in Sorrento peninsula (Italy). The aim and the originality of this research was to propose a public transport design methodology based on a ""strong sustainability"" policy and applied to a real case study. To be precise, the renewing of the ""old"" bus fleet with a diesel plug-in hybrid one charged by a photovoltaic system was proposed, aiming to both improve environmental sustainability and perform an investment return for a private operator in managing the transport service. The proposed case study is particularly suitable because the peculiar morphology of the Sorrento peninsula in Italy does not allow other types of public transport services (e.g., rail, metro). Furthermore, this area, rich in UNESCO sites, has always been an international tourist destination because of the environment and landscape. Estimation results show that the new e-mobility bus service will be able to reduce the greenhouse gases emissions up to the 23%, with a financial payback period of 10 years for a private investor. © 2020 by the authors.","E-mobility; Electric vehicle; Environmental impacts; Local emissions; New technologies; Plug-in hybrid; Revenue-cost analysis; Strong sustainability; Sustainable mobility; Weak sustainability;MaaS","electric vehicle; natural resource; public transport; sustainability; sustainable development; tourist destination; transportation policy; UNESCO; Campania [Italy]; Italy; Napoli [Campania]; Sorrento Peninsula","Henke, I.; Department of Civil, Italy; эл. почта: ilaria.henke@unina.it",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090388695

The current disposal of solid waste is a burgeoning issue and it's in immediate need to shift the existing disposal processes to a sustainable manner. Circular economy (CE) is a conceptual model which is been used for better use of resources and minimization of waste in a closed loop approach which could be appropriate for waste management. In this context, the present review illustrates the effective use of biodegradable and non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste in a closed loop integrated refinery platforms for the recovery of bioenergy resources and for the production of value added products. The biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be treated by advanced biological processes with the simultaneous production of bioenergy such as biohydrogen, biomethane, bioelectricity, etc., and other value added products like butanol, ethanol, methanol etc. The scheme illustrates the closed loop approach, the bioenergy generated from the biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for the operation of internal combustion engines and the energy could be further used for processing the waste. The non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for construction and pavement processes. Overall the study emphasizes the paradigm shift of solid waste management concepts from linear economy to a circular economy following the “Zero Waste” concept. The study also explains the circular economy policies practiced for solid waste management that stimulates the economy of the country and identify the pathways to maximize the local resources. In addition the review addresses the advanced information and communication technologies to unfold the issues and challenges faced in the solid waste management. The smart governance of managing waste using the “Internet of Things” (IoT) is one of the great precursors of technological development that could lead innovations in waste management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Flux engines; Internet of things; Municipal solid waste; Waste to wealth; Zero waste","Electrophysiology; Internet of things; Pavements; Refining; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Advanced informations; Biodegradable fraction; Biological process; Issues and challenges; Municipal solid waste generation; Rapid urbanizations; Technological development; Value added products; Municipal solid waste; alcohol; biodiesel; biogas; butanol; compressed natural gas; hydrogen; methanol; natural gas; synfuel; unclassified drug; economic system; information and communication technology; municipal solid waste; technological development; waste disposal; acidogenesis; Article; bi fuel engine; bioelectrogenesis; bioenergy; biofuel production; biohydrogen; biomethane; biotransformation; circular economy model; conceptual model; dual fuel engine; energy recovery; energy resource; flex fuel engine; industry; integrated biorefinery; internet of things; linear economy model; machine; methanogenesis; municipal solid waste; policy; priority journal; recycling; solid waste management; solid waste; theoretical model; waste disposal; waste management; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management","Velvizhi, G.; CO<sub>2</sub> Research and Green Technology Centre, India; эл. почта: velvizhi.g@vit.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"32408201","English","Sci.

In April 2019, the European Parliament adopted new regulations on public procurement to encourage investment in clean buses—electric, hydrogen, or gas. Directive 2009/33/EC is to apply from the second half of 2021. The aim of this article is to make an attempt to simulate the number of zero-emission buses (ZEB) in European Union (EU) member countries in two time horizons: 2025 and 2030, and to forecast the number of clean vehicles in the precise time horizons, including before and after 2050. Research questions are as follows: (1) what will be the number of ZEBs in individual EU countries over the next few years; (2) which of the EU countries will reach by 2030 the level of 95% share of ZEBs in all buses, which are a fleet of public transport buses; and (3) in which year will which EU countries reach the level of 95% share of zero-emission buses. The method used is a Bass model. The conducted analyses demonstrate that, by 2050, only four of the EU members will be able to reach 95% level of share of clean buses in the city bus transport fleets. It is likely that other countries may not achieve this even by 2050. © 2020 by the authors.

Recently, zebrafish color preferences have gained much attention because of the easy setup of the instrument and its usefulness to screen behavior-linked stimuli. However, several published papers dealing with zebrafish color preferences have contradicting results that underscore the importance of method standardization in this field. Different laboratories may report different results because of variations in light source, color intensity, and other parameters such as age, gender, container size, and strain of fish. In this study, we aim to standardize the color preference test in zebrafish by measuring light source position, light intensity, gender, age, animal size to space ratio, and animal strain. Our results showed that color preferences for zebrafish are affected by light position, age, strain, and social interaction of the fish, but not affected by fish gender. We validated that ethanol can significantly induce color preference alteration in zebrafish which may be related to anxiety and depression. We also explored the potential use of the optimized method to examine color preference ranking and index differences in various zebrafish strains and species, such as the tiger barb and glass catfish. In conclusion, zebrafish color preference screening is a powerful tool for high-throughput neuropharmacological applications and the standardized protocol established in this study provides a useful reference for the zebrafish research community. © 2020 by the authors.","Color preferences; Toxicity assessment; Zebrafish behavior",,"Chen, K.H.-C.; Department of Biological Science and Technology, Taiwan; эл. почта: kelvin@mail.nptu.edu.tw

However, how neuronal activation by different stimuli can lead to distinct transcriptional responses is not well understood. We have been studying how microbial metabolites modulate gene expression in chemosensory neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans. Considering the diverse environmental stimuli that can activate chemosensory neurons of C. elegans, we sought to understand how specific transcriptional responses can be generated in these neurons in response to distinct cues. We have focused on the mechanism of rapid (<6 min) and selective transcriptional induction of daf-7, a gene encoding a TGF-β ligand, in the ASJ chemosensory neurons in response to the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. DAF-7 is required for the protective behavioral avoidance of P. aeruginosa by C. elegans. Here, we define the involvement of two distinct cyclic GMP (cGMP)-dependent pathways that are required for daf-7 expression in the ASJ neuron pair in response to P. aeruginosa. We show that a calcium-independent pathway dependent on the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) EGL-4, and a canonical calcium-dependent signaling pathway dependent on the activity of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit CNG-2, function in parallel to activate rapid, selective transcription of daf-7 in response to P. aeruginosa metabolites. Our data suggest that fast, selective early transcription of neuronal genes require PKG in shaping responses to distinct microbial stimuli in a pair of C. elegans chemosensory neurons.

Method: A literature search of online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Embase, and Ovid) was searched through August 1, 2019, by using the appropriate English keywords. Also, Iran Medex, Barkat, and Magiran databases were searched for Persian articles. Results: Four English and two Persian studies were included in this review. All the articles investigated the economic burden of mortality due to air pollution, in which five, one, and one studies used value of statistical life, compensation payment, and human capital approach. The economic burden of mortality due to air pollution was estimated at $ 316 million to $ 2630 million. Also, five studies (83%) investigated the economic burden of morbidity due to air pollution, in which three, two, and one studies used the cost of illness, percentage of mortality costs, and willingness to pay methods, respectively. The economic burden of morbidity due to air pollution was estimated at $ 236 million to $ 546 million. Conclusion: By systematically reviewing and emphasizing on different methods of measuring the economic burden of mortality and morbidity caused by air pollution, the results show that air pollution is a serious problem in Tehran. Nevertheless, appropriate methods should be used to measure costs to get robust and reliable results. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; Economic burden; Morbidity; Mortality; Systematic review","atmospheric pollution; compensation system; economic analysis; estimation method; human capital; Internet; literature review; morbidity; mortality; willingness to pay; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Scopus","Harati Khalilabad, T.; Department of Health Economics, Iran; эл. почта: Harati.t@iums.ac.ir",,"Springer",18739318,,,,"English","Air Qual.

In this article, the environmental trade-offs in road passenger transportation between conventional vehicles and electrified vehicles are compared, using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Hence, the relevance of a massive electrification approach can be questioned. Assessing a set of current midsize passenger cars and buses allows for investigation of potential environmental issues. This is the first detailed LCA concerning several hybridization levels for cars and buses, and it is based on real consumption data for two traffic conditions. Methods: We focused on the ISO standards (ISO 2006a, b) and analyzed the energy carriers’ life cycle and the vehicle’s life cycle. The functional unit is clearly defined as the transportation of one passenger over 1 km in specific driving conditions from a point A to a point B, without prejudice toward the path taken. Vehicle specifications were derived based on the available manufacturers’ data, literature, and French Institute of Petroleum (IFPEN) experts. For the use stage, two driving cycles were assessed: the “worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedure” (WLTP) cycle and an urban cycle. France was selected as the study area, and a sensitivity analysis was performed based on a European electricity charging mix for electrified vehicles. Results and discussion: Battery electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) exhibit the highest climate change (CC) mitigation potential, provided that the electricity mix has low carbon and that the PHEV is used with a fully-charged battery. With these conditions, PHEVs can perform even better than EVs. In that regard, PHEVs using only a thermic engine perform the worst in regard to CC indicator. It is also worth mentioning that electric buses are the best solution in urban traffic conditions for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Among powertrains, the electrified powertrains are even more important when performing in urban cycles. For other environmental indicators, such as particulate matter emissions, EVs perform worse than conventional thermic vehicles. Conclusions: The results underline the importance of considering vehicles’ life cycles for LCA in the transportation sector and the need for multicriteria environmental analysis. Therefore, electrification of the transportation sector should not be driven by a single CC indicator, as this may generate potential environmental drawbacks. It is also crucial to adapt public policies to the local context because the results are highly sensitive to the electricity charging mix. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Buses; Driving conditions; Electrified vehicles; Energy mix; Life cycle assessment; Passenger car; Road transportation","carbon; Article; battery electric vehicle; bus; car; car driving; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; electricity; energy recovery; environmental change; France; hybridization; life cycle assessment; motor vehicle; particulate matter; plug in hybrid electric vehicle; priority journal; public policy; sensitivity analysis; traffic and transport; traffic safety","Bouter, A.; IFP Énergies nouvelles, 1-4 av. de Bois Préau, France; эл. почта: anne.bouter@ifpen.fr",,"Springer",09483349,,IJLCF,,"English","Int.

Exhaust emissions from transit buses include carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). Key factors affecting bus emission rates have been evaluated separately or in limited combinations in prior studies, including bus size, fuel and powertrain, passenger load, driving cycle, and model year. However, bus emission rates are jointly affected by all of these factors. To systematically evaluate these factors, a transit bus emissions model (TBEM) was developed. TBEM is calibrated based on generic compressed natural gas (CNG) and diesel bus types represented in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator and empirical cycle average emission rates from the Integrated Bus Information System. The importance of the factors varies depending on the pollutant. For emission rates per vehicle-kilometer, model year is an important factor for NOx and PM, fuel and powertrain is an important factor for CO and THC, and driving cycle and bus size are important factors for CO2. For emission rates per passenger-kilometer, passenger load is generally an important factor for each pollutant. For a given fuel and powertrain and pollutant, smaller buses have lower emission rates per vehicle-kilometer than larger buses. However, a full large bus has lower emission rates per passenger-kilometer than a full small bus. There are tradeoffs among bus types regarding emission rates, especially for THC and PM. The comparison of bus emission rates is dependent on interactions between these key factors. For example, the effect of bus size and passenger load on emission rates is larger for lower speed driving cycles. For 2010 and newer model year buses and for moderate to high speed driving cycles, diesel buses have the lowest NOx emission rates whereas for low speed cycles, CNG buses have the lowest NOx emission rates. However, for 2007 to 2009 model year buses, CNG buses have the lowest NOx emission rates regardless of driving cycle. The study will be useful in helping transit planners and policy makers to develop strategies to reduce transit bus fleet emissions and in providing accurate emission factors for use in bus life cycle inventories and emission inventories. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bus size; Exhaust emissions; Passenger load; Transit bus","Bus transportation; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Compressed natural gas; Diesel engines; Environmental Protection Agency; Life cycle; Natural gas vehicles; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Powertrains; Average emission rate; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Emission inventories; High speed driving; Life Cycle Inventory; Motor vehicle emissions; Total hydrocarbons; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Fleet operations; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; fossil fuel; hydrocarbon; natural gas; nitrogen oxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; emission inventory; exhaust emission; fossil fuel; life cycle analysis; natural gas; nitric oxide; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; Article; calibration; carbon footprint; catalyst; combustion; comparative study; controlled study; environmental protection; exhaust gas; particulate matter; priority journal; United States; velocity; United States","Frey, H.C.; Department of Civil, United States; эл. почта: frey@ncsu.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",13522310,,AENVE,,"English","Atmos.

Motile male gametes (sperm cells) are an ancestral eukaryotic trait that has been lost in several lineages like flowering plants. Here, we made use of a phenotypic male fertility difference between two moss (Physcomitrella patens) ecotypes to explore spermatozoid function. We compare genetic and epigenetic variation as well as expression profiles between the Gransden and Reute ecotype to identify a set of candidate genes associated with moss male infertility. We generated a loss-of-function mutant of a coiled-coil domain containing 39 (ccdc39) gene that is part of the flagellar hydin network. Defects in mammal and algal homologues of this gene coincide with a loss of fertility, demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of flagellar function related to male fertility across kingdoms. The Ppccdc39 mutant resembles the Gransden phenotype in terms of male fertility. Potentially, several somatic (epi-)mutations occurred during prolonged vegetative propagation of Gransden, causing regulatory differences of for example the homeodomain transcription factor BELL1. Probably these somatic changes are causative for the observed male fertility defect. We propose that moss spermatozoids might be employed as an easily accessible system to study male infertility of humans and animals in terms of flagellar structure and movement. © 2020 University of Marburg.

Emerging evidence indicates that CNG channels are also involved in signaling pathways important for pain processing. Here, we found that the expression of the channel subunits CNGA2, CNGA3, CNGA4 and CNGB1 in dorsal root ganglia, and of CNGA2 in the spinal cord, is transiently altered after peripheral nerve injury in mice. Specifically, we show using in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time RT-PCR that CNG channels containing the CNGB1b subunit are localized to populations of sensory neurons and predominantly excitatory interneurons in the spinal dorsal horn. In CNGB1 knockout (CNGB1−/−) mice, neuropathic pain behavior is considerably attenuated whereas inflammatory pain behavior is normal. Finally, we provide evidence to support CNGB1 as a downstream mediator of cAMP signaling in pain pathways. Altogether, our data suggest that CNGB1-positive CNG channels specifically contribute to neuropathic pain processing after peripheral nerve injury. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CNGB1; Cyclic nucleotide gated channels; Knockout mice; Nerve injury; Neuropathic pain","cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; cyclic nucleotide gated channel; cyclic nucleotide gated channel A2; cyclic nucleotide gated channel A3; cyclic nucleotide gated channel A4; cyclic nucleotide gated channel B1; hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cAMP induced pain; controlled study; electrophysiology; experimental pain; heterozygosity; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; interneuron; membrane permeability; mouse; neuropathic pain; nociception; nonhuman; peripheral nerve injury; priority journal; protein expression; protein localization; quantitative analysis; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rotarod test; sensory nerve cell; signal transduction; spinal cord dorsal horn; upregulation","Kallenborn-Gerhardt, W.; Institute of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy, Biozentrum N260, Max-von Laue Straße 9, Germany; эл. почта: kallenborn@med.uni-frankfurt.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",00283908,,NEPHB,"32272140","English","Neuropharmacology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083298381

A field campaign at the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory (CVAO) in the tropics in September-October 2017 formed the core of this project that was jointly performed with the project MARSU (MARine atmospheric Science Unravelled). A suite of chemical, physical, biological and meteorological techniques was applied, and comprehensive measurements of bulk water, the sea surface microlayer (SML), cloud water and ambient aerosol particles collected at a ground-based and a mountain station took place. Key variables comprised the chemical characterization of the atmospherically relevant OM components in the ocean and the atmosphere as well as measurements of INPs and CCN. Moreover, bacterial cell counts, mercury species and trace gases were analyzed. To interpret the results, the measurements were accompanied by various auxiliary parameters such as air mass back-trajectory analysis, vertical atmospheric profile analysis, cloud observations and pigment measurements in seawater. Additional modeling studies supported the experimental analysis. During the campaign, the CVAO exhibited marine air masses with low and partly moderate dust influences. The marine boundary layer was well mixed as indicated by an almost uniform particle number size distribution within the boundary layer. Lipid biomarkers were present in the aerosol particles in typical concentrations of marine background conditions. Accumulation-and coarse-mode particles served as CCN and were efficiently transferred to the cloud water. The ascent of ocean-derived compounds, such as sea salt and sugar-like compounds, to the cloud level, as derived from chemical analysis and atmospheric transfer modeling results, denotes an influence of marine emissions on cloud formation. Organic nitrogen compounds (free amino acids) were enriched by several orders of magnitude in submicron aerosol particles and in cloud water compared to seawater. However, INP measurements also indicated a significant contribution of other non-marine sources to the local INP concentration, as (biologically active) INPs were mainly present in supermicron aerosol particles that are not suggested to undergo strong enrichment during ocean-atmosphere transfer. In addition, the number of CCN at the supersaturation of 0.30 % was about 2.5 times higher during dust periods compared to marine periods. Lipids, sugar-like compounds, UV-absorbing (UV: ultraviolet) humic-like substances and low-molecularweight neutral components were important organic compounds in the seawater, and highly surface-active lipids were enriched within the SML. The selective enrichment of specific organic compounds in the SML needs to be studied in further detail and implemented in an OM source function for emission modeling to better understand transfer patterns, the mechanisms of marine OM transformation in the atmosphere and the role of additional sources. In summary, when looking at particulate mass, we see oceanic compounds transferred to the atmospheric aerosol and to the cloud level, while from a perspective of particle number concentrations, sea spray aerosol (i.e., primary marine aerosol) contributions to both CCN and INPs are rather limited. © Author(s) 2020.",,"aerosol; air mass; biological production; cloud condensation nucleus; dust; marine environment; meteorology; organic matter; sea surface; Cape Verde [Macaronesia]; Bacteria (microorganisms)","Van Pinxteren, M.; Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS)Germany; эл. почта: manuela@tropos.de

Regions of high differentiation can arise due to divergent selection acting on selected loci, genetic hitchhiking of nearby loci, or through repeated selection against deleterious alleles (linked background selection); this divergence may then be further elevated in regions of reduced recombination. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from Europe and North America diverged &gt;600,000 years ago and despite some evidence of secondary contact, the majority of genetic data indicate substantial divergence between lineages. This deep divergence with potential gene flow provides an opportunity to investigate the role of different mechanisms that shape the genomic landscape during early speciation. Here, using 184,295 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 80 populations, we investigate the genomic landscape of differentiation across the Atlantic Ocean with a focus on highly differentiated regions and the processes shaping them. We found evidence of high (mean FST = 0.26) and heterogeneous genomic differentiation between continents. Genomic regions associated with high trans-Atlantic differentiation ranged in size from single loci (SNPs) within important genes to large regions (1–3 Mbp) on four chromosomes (Ssa06, Ssa13, Ssa16 and Ssa19). These regions showed signatures consistent with selection, including high linkage disequilibrium, despite no significant reduction in recombination. Genes and functional enrichment of processes associated with differentiated regions may highlight continental differences in ocean navigation and parasite resistance. Our results provide insight into potential mechanisms underlying differences between continents, and evidence of near-fixed and potentially adaptive trans-Atlantic differences concurrent with a background of high genome-wide differentiation supports subspecies designation in Atlantic salmon. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptation; conservation genetics; fish; genomics; population genetics","animal; Atlantic Ocean; Europe; genetic selection; genetics; genomics; molecular evolution; North America; Salmo salar; single nucleotide polymorphism; United States; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Europe; Evolution, Molecular; Genomics; North America; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Salmo salar; Selection, Genetic; United States","Lehnert, S.J.; Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Canada; эл. почта: sarah.lehnert@dfo-mpo.gc.ca

The nematode parasites (Nematoda: Filarioidea) that cause LF require both arthropod (mosquito) intermediate hosts and mammalian definitive hosts for their propagation. The invasion and migration of filarial worms through host tissues are complex and critical to survival, yet little is known about the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate directed migration in these medically important species. In order to better understand the role of chemosensory signaling in filarial worm taxis, we employ comparative genomics, transcriptomics, reverse genetics, and chemical approaches to identify putative chemosensory receptor proteins and perturb chemotaxis phenotypes in filarial worms. We find that chemoreceptor family size is correlated with the presence of environmental (extrahost) stages in nematode life cycles, and that filarial worms contain compact and highly diverged chemoreceptor complements and lineage-specific ion channels that are predicted to operate downstream of chemoreceptor activation. In Brugia malayi, an etiological agent of LF, chemoreceptor expression patterns correspond to distinct parasite migration events across the life cycle. To interrogate the role of chemosensation in the migration of larval worms, arthropod and mammalian infectious stage Brugia parasites were incubated in nicotinamide, an agonist of the nematode transient receptor potential (TRP) channel OSM-9. Exposure of microfilariae to nicotinamide alters intramosquito migration, and exposure of L3s reduces chemotaxis toward host-associated cues in vitro. Nicotinamide also potently modulates thermosensory responses in L3s, suggesting a polymodal sensory role for Brugia osm-9. Reverse genetic studies implicate both Brugia osm-9 and the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel subunit tax-4 in larval chemotaxis toward host serum, and these ion channel subunits partially rescue sensory defects in Caenorhabditis elegans osm-9 and tax-4 knock-out strains. Together, these data reveal genetic and functional diversification of chemosensory signaling proteins in filarial worms and encourage a more thorough investigation of clade- and parasite-specific facets of nematode sensory receptor biology.

Improving the environmental performance of HEIs is an important step to achieve nationwide impact reduction. Academic buildings are among the largest infrastructure units in HEIs. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the environmental performance of academic buildings during their operations. Identifying critical academic buildings posing high impacts calls for methodologies that can holistically assess the environmental performance of buildings with respect to water and energy consumption, and GHG emission. This study proposes a fuzzy clustering approach to classify academic buildings in an HEI and benchmark their environmental performance in terms of water, energy, and carbon flows. To account for the fuzzy uncertainties in partitioning, the fuzzy c-means algorithm is employed to classify the buildings based on water, energy, and carbon flow indicators. The application of the developed methodology is demonstrated by a case study of 71 academic buildings in the University of British Columbia, Canada. The assessed buildings are grouped into three clusters representing different levels of performances with different degrees of membership. The environmental performance of each cluster is then benchmarked. Based on the results, the environmental performances of academic buildings are holistically determined, and the building clusters associated with low environmental performances are identified for potential improvements. The subsequent benchmark will allow HEIs to compare the impacts of academic building operations and set realistic targets for impact reduction. © 2020 by the authors.","Academic buildings; Environmental performance; Fuzzy clustering analysis; Higher educational institutions; Metabolic flows; Performance benchmarking","algorithm; benchmarking; building; carbon emission; carbon footprint; energy use; fuzzy mathematics; greenhouse gas; operations technology; university sector; water use; British Columbia; Canada","Sadiq, R.; School of Engineering, 3333 University Way, Canada; эл. почта: rehan.sadiq@ubc.ca",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086092820

My argument is that the literature with emerging focus does not rely on the grand theories of social change in contrast to the literature with original focus. Based on this argument, I raise two questions: 1- what does MLP lack to study transitions in these societies. 2- What is the normative stand upon which the sustainability transition should be based. To address these questions, the paper used a post-structuralist tool box in the process of an action research workshop with a CLA structure. The case study was that of the car fuel socio-technical system in Iran. The paper concludes two points: 1- The coupling of Multilevel Perspective and Causal Layered Analysis can find facts which would have been hidden if the research were confined to the MLP framework. 2- Reflexiveness calls for societal platform to disclose and project discursive struggles and facilitate the inclusion of others.

APTI is calculated from parameters that are affected by air pollutants, such as ascorbic acid content, total chlorophyll content, relative water content and pH of leaf extract. In this study we report APTI values of two common tree species (Celtis occidentalis and Tilia sp.) in Debrecen, Hungary. We also ran a meta-analysis to compare APTI values among various global cities and land use types (industrial, roadside and urban) using robust ANOVA. APTI's relationship with city population and PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 μm) was analysed using regression modelling and Principal Component Analysis. We applied Random Forest Regression for statistical model building. We demonstrated that the tolerance of tree species is higher in industrial areas and in cities with high pollution levels than in control areas. We found a strong positive correlation between APTI and the size of cities. The cities showed a separation along the first principal component, which was also correlated with APTI and the size of cities.

Currently, for many manufacturers the task of reducing production costs is a key priority. In agriculture the essential expenditure item is made up of costs for mobile power facilities fuel. One way to decrease these costs is to use alternative, cheaper fuels. Natural gas is one of them. Diesel is the most common type of engine in agriculture. Though a lot of research on converting diesel engines to natural gas have been carried out, the problem of transition of high performance diesel engines of low dimension to natural gas is still understudied. Diesel D-245.7 (4CHN11/12.5) was taken as the object for the research. The aim of study is converting diesel to a gas-diesel process. Carrying out bench tests with recording regulating characteristics according to the fuel injection advance angle was one of the research stages. As the result of the bench tests there have been established the parameters of the combustion process, heat release characteristics, and effective indicators at different fuel injection advance angles when working on diesel and gas-diesel process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,"Kovalev I.V.Voroshilova A.A.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

It is assumed that at the peak of the parabola, the complex corresponds to a volume with finite dimensions.

It follows that you can use a statistical average from a set of complexes, which will allow you to get the same result. Statically, the reaction rates are considered with the assumption that the initial substances and activated complexes are found in the equilibrium state.

In the course of the analysis, a number of positive aspects were identified that characterize the increase in the efficiency of the research industry, namely, there has been an increase in labor productivity, overall savings in energy resources used for own needs have been noted, and environmental profiles of enterprises have improved. However, along with this, a number of negative trends are revealed, the most significant of which authors consider to be: the growth of unprofitable enterprises, the decrease in solvency and current financial stability due to the significant exposure of the industry to opportunistic and seasonal fluctuations, as well as the persistent negative impact of the industry on the environment. An important feature of the energy sector of Russian economy is the lack of positive dynamics in increasing renewable energy sources in the total volume of its production, which does not allow talking about a significant increase in environmental security in this industry. The authors associate the perspective directions of the Russian energy sector development with the need to increase the share of renewable energy sources, and the development of the industry using traditional sources should be based on the interconnection of three important components: economic feasibility, resource endowment, and environmental acceptance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,"Kovalev I.V.Voroshilova A.A.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Air samples of selected NMHCs and their derivatives were collected from four different sites (one traffic intersection, one industrial, and two residential) in Delhi and were analyzed on Gas Chromatograph (GC) to obtain their atmospheric concentrations. At each site, a survey among the roadside vendors was also conducted to obtain information about their bodyweight and exposure to outdoor ambient air. The study reveals that hazard quotient of 1,3-butadiene is greater than one at all the sites, with its maximum value occurring at the industrial site. The major contributors to the workplace cancer risk (WCR) are found to be 1,3-butadiene and chloroform. The overall WCR is observed to be the highest (9.4 × 10−4) at the traffic intersection site, followed by the industrial site (7.0 × 10−4). Cancer incidence data and the population data are also used to estimate the growth of cancer risk in Delhi from 2009 to 2016. Comparison of the WCR values of the four sites with the cancer risk estimated from the cancer incidence data shows that NMHCs and their derivatives are significant contributors to the overall cancer risk in Delhi.

Additionally, the hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI) and cancer risk (Risk) of NMHC species in the vehicle exhaust were calculated. Both the HI and Risk of these species in the exhaust from gasoline-powered vehicles greatly exceeded those from the other four types of vehicles, suggesting that using clean alternative fuels instead of gasoline benefits human health. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","CNG; Health risk assessment; LNG; LPG; Ozone formation potential; VOCs","Alternative fuels; Compressed natural gas; Gasoline; Hazards; Health; Health risks; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas vehicles; Risk assessment; Roadsides; Clean alternative fuel; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Emission characteristics; Environmental and health effects; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Non-methane hydrocarbons; Ozone formation potentials; Liquefied petroleum gas; alternative fuel; environmental impact; exhaust emission; health impact; health risk; liquefied natural gas; liquefied petroleum gas; ozone; public health; China","Fei, L.; Key Laboratory of Water and Air Pollution Control of Guangdong Province, China; эл. почта: feileilei@scies.org",,"AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research",16808584,,,,"English","Aerosol Air Qual.

External factors, such as temperature, background flows and ion composition, play an important role in fertilization success. Specific mechanisms guiding spermatozoa appear to be essential to maximize the sperm–egg encounter under these strenuous conditions. Although some existing data support the hypothesis that both the ovarian fluid and the eggs may release chemoattractants that significantly affect spermatozoa behaviour and the fertilization outcome, this hypothesis is still open to debate, as the existence of freshwater fish spermatozoa chemotaxis has yet to be demonstrated; in addition, specific mechanisms supporting spermatozoa guidance and gamete selection have not been elucidated. Is the natural selection of gametes determined by a combination of different physicochemical phenomena? Alternatively, is the natural selection of species-specific gametes biased towards the species-specific guidance mechanisms of their natural landscape? These questions have received more attention as new studies have revealed potential, distinct guidance mechanisms in freshwater fish reproduction. In this review, we discuss the empirical studies supporting different hypotheses about freshwater fish gamete guidance and highlight the synergistic combination of experiments and biomathematical modelling to explore these questions. Finally, we discuss the challenges in understanding the mechanisms behind sperm guidance in freshwater fish species, and we suppose that knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie spermatozoa selection and guidance in freshwater fish species may elucidate the impact of the traditional aquaculture practice of artificial fertilization on progeny quality and species sustainability. © 2019 The Authors.

Furthermore, static assessment models were used and most of the domestic evaluation studies were based on foreign data, leading to conclusions that were far different from the actual situations in China. To address the aforementioned problems, a dynamic assessment model was set up based on the Vensim software for dynamic quantitative evaluation and analysis. The model dynamically evaluated and analyzed the effect of lightweight trend of automobile products(in particular lightweight of material)on material, energy consumption, emission and cost throughout the automobile life cycle including material acquisition, material processing, parts processing and manufacturing, assembly, utilization and recycling. The conventional gasoline vehicle and pure electric vehicle developed from the same platform of a company were selected as research object. The results showed that various evaluation indexes of the pure electric vehicle had different degrees of reduction due to composite lightweight effect of aluminum and magnesium. However, evaluation indexes of the gasoline vehicle, including the life cycle PM, CO emission and environmental cost, Health Toxic Potential(HTP)and so on had respective increase. The lightweight effect of pure electric vehicle was remarkable. © 2020, Editorial Department of CIMS.

Much of this demand is met by private vehicles, of which conventionally powered two-wheelers significantly contribute to air pollution. The consumer adoption of alternative fuel powered two-wheelers has not been the subject of as much study as passenger cars. In particular, studies of consumer adoption of electric motorcycles, which are a rapidly emerging and an environmentally more sustainable alternative to conventional powered two-wheelers, are few. This study explores the extent of this research gap. The development of motorcycles is analyzed with a focus on Asia, which accounts for 80% of the global fleet. Powered two-wheelers are categorized in terms of regulatory, fuel and technical aspects. Studies of the adoption of electric motorcycles are reviewed.

Nevertheless, a comprehensive literature review is missing for the prospects of electric vehicles in developing countries. Such an overview would be instrumental for policymakers to understand the barriers and opportunities related to different types of electric vehicles (EVs). Considering the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was performed of the electronic databases Google Scholar andWeb of Science for the years 2010-2020. The electric four-wheelers, hybrid electric vehicles and electric two-wheeler constituted the electric vehicles searched in the databases. Initially, 35 studies identified in theWeb of Science that matched the criteria were studied. Later, 105 other relevant reports and articles related to barriers and opportunities were found by using Google Scholar and studied. Results reveal that electric four-wheelers are not a feasible option in developing countries due to their high purchase price. On the contrary, electric two-wheelers may be beneficial as they come with a lower purchase price. © 2020 by the authors.","Developing countries; Driving forces; Electric vehicles; Resisting forces","cost analysis; developing world; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; literature review; meta-analysis; policy making; World Wide Web","Rajper, S.Z.; Department of Economics, Belgium; эл. почта: sarmad.rajper@ugent.be",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082550637

Based on the model results, we forecast future residents’ urban transport CO2 emissions under several scenarios of different urban and transport policies and new energy technologies. We find nonlinear quadratic growth relationship between commuting CO2 emissions and per capita GDP, and the elasticities of household and individual commuting CO2 emission to per capita GDP are 1.90% and 1.45%, respectively. Developing job-housing balanced satellite cities and self-contained polycentric city can greatly decrease emissions from high emitters and can contribute to about 51–82% of the emission reductions by 2050 compared with the scenario of business as usual (BAU). Promotion of electric vehicles, electric public buses, metros, and improvement of traditional energy efficiency contributes to about 48–57% of the emission reductions by 2050 compared with the BAU. When these policies and technologies are combined, about 90% of the emissions could be reduced by 2050 compared with the BAU, and the emissions will be about 1.2–4.9 times of the present. The findings suggest that fostering polycentric urban form and job-housing balanced satellite cities is the key step for future transport CO2 emission reductions. Metro network promotion, energy efficiency improvement, and new energy type applications can also be effective in emission reductions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic growth; Electric vehicle; Polycentric urban form; Rail and metro; Satellite city; Tobit model","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Housing; Satellites; Subways; Urban growth; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emission reduction; Developing cities; Economic growths; Emission reduction; Energy efficiency improvements; New energy technologies; Urban form; Urban transportation; atmospheric transport; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; electric vehicle; emission control; factor analysis; Gross Domestic Product; metro system; numerical model; regression analysis; scenario analysis; urban morphology; urbanization","Wang, Y.; Department of Traffic Engineering, China; эл. почта: wyq21@vip.sina.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",13619209,,TRDTF,,"English","Transp.

At the textual surface, the analysis finds that China's shale gas (SG) is compared most frequently with coal and energy imports but rarely with conventional natural gas (CNG) and coalbed methane (CBM), representing a prominent structure of epistemological dominance and ignorance. Situated in this structure there are four prevailing, albeit defective, reasoning forms. The prevalence of those forms suggests that there is a “knowledge deficit” on the comparative advantage of China's SG. This deficit concretely refers to that, the attention paid to the comparative advantage of China's SG toward CNG and CBM, the number of lifecycle-comparisons between energies, and the knowledge about the US shale gas boom, are significantly insufficient. China's energy mix, air quality and energy dependence, the conspicuousness of energy burning, and the nature of human thinking are interwoven factors of this deficit. The epistemological structure and thus the “knowledge deficit” are unfavorable for optimizing China's SG strategy and may delay natural gas' penetration into China's energy mix.

In particular, natural gas has come to occupy a new identity in this discourse, shifting from what was once a negligible portion of the energy mix in the United States to one of the nation's most important energy resources. Though the “bridge fuel” metaphor was once fairly unambiguous in its meaning, the term has evolved over time to incorporate many visions of the future roles of coal and natural gas in the energy mix. To probe the variety of these meanings in public discourse, we assess the bridge fuel narrative in news articles and government publications as a means to understand the complexity and context of political debates over the unfolding future of natural gas. Using a qualitative coding scheme, we examine five different interpretations of the bridge fuel metaphor between 1988 and 2016. We argue that with its unique quality of facilitating both consensus-building and contestation, the bridge fuel metaphor's simplicity and accessibility belie its power to reveal changing expectations, values, and visions of the future of American energy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy policy; Energy transition; Fossil fuels; Natural gas; Policy metaphor; Renewable energy",,"Delborne, J.A.; Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources, Campus Box 8008, United States; эл. почта: Jason_Delborne@ncsu.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

The economic burden of air pollution on Iran’s economy was estimated to be 8 and 10 billion dollars in 2005 and 2010, respectively. Using air pollution models, including emission and dispersion models, has been proposed as a logical solution to overcome problems such as expensive measurement methods and in some cases, difficulty and impossibility of direct measurements. In this paper, IVE emission model was used for estimating emission amounts and emission factors of taxi fleet of Imam Khomeini Street, one of main and busiest streets in Tabriz, as a representative street and for studying effects of different scenarios. AERMOD dispersion model was used for investigating the dispersion pattern of emitted pollutants from this fleet and to estimate the effect of using local base emission factors and replacement of present taxi fleet by environmental friendly vehicles in this city. CO, CH4, and NOx pollutants with quantities of 108, 20.7, and 5.4 g/km have the highest emission factor among all pollutants. Amount of hourly emissions per each pollutant, daily emission amount by technology types, and daily emission amount of each technology by pollutant types were also examined. CO emission has the highest amount at 7–8 in the morning, and at noon hours, emission of NOx and VOC increases. Technologies with old fuel injection and emission control systems and higher mileage have higher level of pollution emission. Investigating dispersion of pollutants from this fleet in the atmosphere shows pollutants movement in the northwest direction. Performance statistics of AERMOD model, such as FB, NMSE, MG, VG, FAC2, and R by use of pollution level of two adjacent air pollution monitoring stations were determined to continue. Three air pollution scenarios are used to assay effects of using site-specific base emission factors; replacement of worn-out portion of fleet with two distinct technology types (gasoline fuel and CNG fuel) were investigated. As a result under the first and second scenarios, 6.4% and 3.9% decrease of GWP would be estimated respectively and under the third scenario, 7.8% increase of GWP relative to the present study was observed. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AERMOD dispersion model; Driving pattern; IVE software; Taxi fleet; Vehicle pollution","Compressed natural gas; Emission control; Fleet operations; Nitrogen oxides; Taxicabs; Urban transportation; Air pollution sources; Air-pollution monitoring stations; Dispersion modeling; Driving pattern; Environmental friendly vehicles; Performance statistics; Taxi fleets; Vehicle pollution; Air pollution","Zeinali Heris, S.; Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Faculty, Iran; эл. почта: s.zeinali@tabrizu.ac.ir",,"Springer",21993629,,,,"English","Emiss.

So far, a capability to unambiguously encode heat has been demonstrated only for the sensory triad of the spike bursting thermo- and two bimodal hygro-thermoreceptor neurons located in the antennal dome-shaped sensilla (DSS) in a carabid beetle. We used extracellular single sensillum recording in the range of 20–45°C to demonstrate that a similar sensory triad in the elaterid Agriotes obscurus also produces high temperature-induced bursty spike trains. Several parameters of the bursts are temperature dependent, allowing the neurons in a certain order to encode different, but partly overlapping ranges of heat up to lethal levels in a graded manner. ISI in a burst is the most useful parameter out of six. Our findings consider spike bursting as a general, fundamental quality of the classical sensory triad of antennal thermo- and hygro-thermoreceptor neurons widespread in many insect groups, being a flexible and reliable mode of coding unfavorably high temperatures. The possible involvement of spike bursting in behavioral thermoregulation of the beetles is discussed. By contrast, the mean firing rate of the neurons in regular and bursty spike trains combined does not carry useful thermal information at the high end of noxious heat. © Copyright © 2020 Merivee, Must, Nurme, Di Giulio, Muzzi, Williams and Mänd.","antennal dome-shaped sensilla; bimodal thermohygroreceptor neuron; insects; peripheral spike bursting; thermoreceptor neuron","Agriotes; article; controlled study; firing rate; high temperature; nerve cell; nonhuman; sensillum; spike; thermoreceptor; thermoregulation","Merivee, E.; Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonia; эл. почта: enno.merivee@emu.ee",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",16625153,,,,"English","Front.

Unlike common practice, we derive the cradle-to-grave inventories from an originally combustion engine VW Caddy that was disassembled and electrified in our laboratory, and its energy consumption was measured on the road. Ecoivent 2.2 and 3.0 emission inventories were contrasted exhibiting basically insignificant impact deviations. Ecoinvent 3.0 emission inventory for the diesel car was additionally updated with recent real-world close emission values and revealed strong increases over four midpoint impact categories, when matched with the standard Ecoinvent 3.0 emission inventory. Producing batteries with photovoltaic electricity instead of Chinese coal-based electricity decreases climate impacts of battery production by 69%. Break-even mileages for the electric VW Caddy to pass the combustion engine models under various conditions in terms of climate change impact ranged from 17,000 to 310,000 km. Break-even mileages, when contrasting the VW Caddy and a mini car (SMART), which was as well electrified, did not show systematic differences. Also, CO2-eq emissions in terms of passenger kilometers travelled (54-158 g CO2-eq/PKT) are fairly similar based on 1 person travelling in the mini car and 1.57 persons in the mid-sized car (VW Caddy). Additionally, under optimized conditions (battery production and use phase utilizing renewable electricity), the two electric cars can compete well in terms of CO2-eq emissions per passenger kilometer with other traffc modes (diesel bus, coach, trains) over lifetime. Only electric buses were found to have lower life cycle carbon emissions (27-52 g CO2-eq/PKT) than the two electric passenger cars. © 2020 by the author.","Battery production; Battery second use; Battery size; BEV (battery electric vehicle); Break-even mileages; Climate change impact; Diesel; Electric bus; LCA; Life cycle assessment; Passenger kilometers travelled; Real-world driving; Real-world life-cycle inventory; Traffic modes; Vehicle size effect","climate change; climate effect; combustion; diesel engine; electric vehicle; emission inventory; equipment; life cycle analysis; sensitivity analysis","Helmers, E.; Department of Environmental Planning and Technology, Trier.

They are further associated with adverse health impacts within urban ecosystems. In order to manage and control deteriorating urban air quality, an efficient and effective urban air quality management plan is required consisting of systematic sampling, monitoring and analysis; modelling; and control protocols. Air quality monitoring is the essential and basic step that develops foundation of any management plan. The present research article describes a comprehensive methodology for establishing a systematic and robust air quality monitoring network in LMICs and strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of urban air quality management frameworks. It also describes step-by-step procedures for chemical characterization of both organic and inorganic constituents of ambient particulate matter along with molecular markers, which are essential to identify the corresponding sources of particulate matter, an integral part of air pollution monitoring protocol. Additionally, it discusses the need for coupling low cost wireless sensor-based stations with a limited number of manual and conventional real time ambient air monitoring stations in order to make it cost effective, yet robust.

Different drivetrain technologies, such as hybrid or battery electric vehicles, electrified roads, liquefied natural gas and hydrogen, might offer solutions to this problem. To assess their ecological and economic impact, these concepts were simulated including a weight and cost model to estimate the total cost of ownership. An evolutionary algorithm optimizes each vehicle to find a concept specific optimal solution. A model calculates the minimum investment in infrastructure required to meet the energy demand for each concept. A well-to-wheel analysis takes into account upstream and on-road carbon dioxide emissions, to compare fully electric vehicles with conventional combustion engines. Investment in new infrastructure is the biggest drawback of electrified road concepts, although they offer low CO2 emissions. The diesel hybrid is the best compromise between carbon reduction and costs. © 2019 The Authors.

This study assesses the economic and carbon benefits of electric technology vehicles in the U.S., accounting for household-by-household behavioral variability and geographical differences in fuel and electricity prices. This finer resolution provides insight into subsets of the population for whom adoption is economically or environmentally favorable, allowing us to construct marginal abatement cost curves for CO2 that account for geographic, behavioral, and stock heterogeneities. Currently, low gasoline prices and high initial expense means that, without subsidies, few consumers benefit financially from electric technology vehicles (1.7% of drivers). However, improved technology dramatically and nonlinearly increases both the number of consumers that benefit and corresponding carbon emissions that could be abated without government subsidy. Our results clarify cost targets that electric vehicle technology must achieve in order to deliver net financial and subsidy-free environmental benefits.

In this article, we investigate how groups with lower social-economic status are disproportionally affected by outdoor air pollution. Based on a comparative case study of two heavily polluted urban areas around Beijing and Delhi, we find that people's economic welfare and political rights are affected disproportionally not only by toxic air pollutants, but also through various policy interventions, market activities, and social practices designed to reduce or adapt to air pollution. Drawing on the concepts of environmental justice and just transitions, we present an analytical framework for investigating the links between outdoor air pollution and social inequalities. The framework enables a better understanding of structural constraints, political constraints and protective constraints in the context of outdoor air pollution and their impacts on social vulnerabilities with particular relevance to fast industrialising countries. We also provide recommendations on how to design and implement air pollution policies and social interventions in a socially inclusive manner. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Ambient air pollution; Beijing; Delhi; environmental risk; social inequalities; social vulnerability","ambient air; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; environmental risk; policy approach; policy implementation; pollution effect; pollution exposure; pollution policy; socioeconomic status; vulnerability; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Delhi; India","Shen, W.; Institute of Development StudiesUnited Kingdom; эл. почта: w.shen@ids.ac.uk",,"Routledge",13549839,,,,"English","Local Environ.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075122408

Hence a renewable energy source is much required at the moment Wind energy is a renewable source of energy. today, the output power from wind turbines can be utilized in two ways, either by direct use of the mechanical shaft power (through a gear in gear ratio) or by letting the wind turbine power and electrical generator, and utilizing the generated power as electrical power. This paper brings a new possibility for the utilization of the wind generated power, for various electrical components inside a typical railway train through the batteries, charged by the wind energy harnessed by a wind turbine mounted at the top of the train coaches. This setup consists of duct, turbine, and generator. The setup is designed in such a way that it does not affect the performance of the train. Average velocity is estimated for the train and the suitable specification of generator is selected. The theoretical calculations of duct, turbine and pulley parameters are calculated and the whole setup is designed in CATIA, also by varying the inlet air velocity, the speed and torque of the turbine are calculated using CFX software. These parameters are used for calculating generator's speed and torque and are validated by comparing with the theoretical design calculations. Future advancements are discussed, and a path for experimental verification is proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Colonization by Piriformospora indica, a growth-promoting root endosymbiont, activates cytosolic Ca2+ in Arabidopsis roots. In this study, we examined the role and functional relevance of calcium channels responsible for Ca2+ fluxes. Expression profiling revealed that CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNEL 19 (CNGC19) is an early-activated gene, induced by unidentified components in P. indica cell-wall extract. Functional analysis showed that loss-of-function of CNGC19 resulted in growth inhibition by P.indica, due to increased colonization and loss of controlled fungal growth. The cngc19 mutant showed reduced elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ in response to P. indica cell-wall extract in comparison to the wild-type. Microbeassociated molecular pattern-triggered immunity was compromised in the cngc19 lines, as evidenced by unaltered callose deposition, reduced cis-(+)-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, jasmonate, and jasmonoyl isoleucine levels, and downregulation of jasmonate and other defense-related genes, which contributed to a shift towards a pathogenic response. Loss-of-function of CNGC19 resulted in an inability to modulate indole glucosinolate content during P. indica colonization. CNGC19-mediated basal immunity was dependent on the AtPep receptor, PEPR. CNGC19 was also crucial for P. indica-mediated suppression of AtPep-induced immunity. Our results thus demonstrate that Arabidopsis CNGC19 is an important Ca2+ channel that maintains a robust innate immunity and is crucial for growth-promotion signaling upon colonization by P. indica. © The Author(s) 2020.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Callose; Cell-wall extract; Cellotriose; CNGC19; Indole glucosinolates; Phytohormones; Piriformospora indica; Serendipita indica",,"Vadassery, J.; National Institute of Plant Genome Research, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, India; эл. почта: jyothi.v@nipgr.ac.in",,"Oxford University Press",00220957,,JEBOA,,"English","J.

Any city trying to become a smart and sustainable one must provide a better quality of life for its citizens and address the problem of degrading air quality and increasing pollutant emissions. The solution for these problems requires selection and decision-making among a number of candidate emission-control-alternatives that need to satiate a number of technical constraints, policy criteria and regulations. For a given pollutant and emission source, a number of control technologies are available; hence, it is coveted to choose the best combination among them to reduce emissions to a desired standard. Because of its applicability, flexibility and ease of computation in solving large-scale practical problems, dynamic programming-based approach appears to be the appropriate and feasible choice for optimal air pollution control technology selection for an urban metropolitan area. Current study develops a dynamic programming (DP) model that determines the optimal selection strategy, after defining different parameters, at a minimized total cost. The usage and applicability of the proposed model were illustrated with a representative case study of a simulated city with three major sources of pollution. It is inferred that DP is ideal for the ‘multiple sources—multiple control technologies—single air pollutant’ optimization problem. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Air pollution control; Dynamic programming; Optimization; Smart city; Technology selection","Air quality; Decision making; Emission control; Air pollution control technology; Control technologies; Decision making models; Optimization problems; Pollutant emission; Rapid urbanizations; Representative case; Technical constraints; Dynamic programming","Shiva Kumar, G.; Department of Civil Engineering, India; эл. почта: shivakumar00740@gmail.com",,"Springer",23662557,,,,"English","Lect.

Due to the demand for lightweight and strong nature of materials, aluminium is considered as largely utilized material for manufacturing components in industrial and other manufacturing sectors. However, aluminium materials are being researched through the decades for improvising the mechanical properties. Therefore, hybrid matrix composites are introduced to improve the mechanical properties by the addition of reinforcements. One of the recent advancements in hybrid metal composites is the introduction of nanoparticles in the composition mixture. In this research work, an aluminium hybrid metal matrix composite is prepared by the nano reinforcement particles. Aluminium is considered to be an efficient element for manufacturing and numerous level of hybridization is carried out in the metal processing. In this current research work, aluminium alloy 2219 is hybridized with nanoparticles of Titanium Carbide, Aluminium Oxide and Silicon Nitride with the proportion of 94% of the primary material with 6% of reinforcement material. The reinforcements are fabricated by the conventional processing of advanced method of casting process namely stirring-squeeze casting process for manufacturing the proposed reinforced material. The advantage of this squeeze casting process, it can limit the defects than conventional casting process. The fabrication process develops eight sets of cylindrical specimens of dimension 50 x 150 mm for testing under varied melt and die temperatures which are maintained at 800 °C and 400 °C and squeeze pressure of 100 Mpa during each level of fabrication. Mechanical testing is carried out after the fabrication process and tested the properties of prepared specimens under loading conditions. Tensile testing and hardness of the material are tested on universal testing machine and Brinell hardness with intender ball of 5 mm diameter under 250 kg loading condition. The statistical method of analysis is one of the easiest way analysis the error rate of the result obtained in the experimentation through machine learning process. Therefore, this research develops a statistical analysis method for optimizing the process parameters for better improvement in mechanical properties. The K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) are proposed for optimizing the process parameters of stirring-squeeze casting process. Conclusively, the result concludes with a comparative study of experimental and predicted outcomes. From the result of comparison, the proposed composition of material has highest level of mechanical properties for manufacturing components in a real-time scenario respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The MLSP is usually performed in a massively peening mode to induce uniform compressive residual stress and surface deformation across the entire specimens. After MLSP, tensile testing was carried out to obtain the tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and percentage elongation. The microstructural and surface topography investigations of the laser shock peened material were carried out using digital, optical microscopy and SEM equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and XRD. The results show that laser shock peened with confined ablation make the surface of CP-Ti with improved change in microstructure, increase in tensile strength, microhardness (73.08%), surface roughness and compressive residual stresses (-420 MPa) which prolongs the mastication ability and dimensional stability of dental implant restorative materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The temperature of fuel oxidation is assumed to be 1,400 °C while the pressure for carburetor and diesel engines is assumed to be 60 atm and 80 atm respectively. The studies have been carried out for natural and synthetic fuels such as hydrogen, ethanol, methanol, petroleum, diesel fuel and methane at the excess air coefficient corresponding to the fuel oxidation temperature of 1,400 °C. In the paper, the method for calculating the equilibrium composition based on the equilibrium constant and mass conservation equations has been applied. It is shown that with an increase in pressure from 1 atm to 60 atm for carburetor engines and up to 80 atm for diesel engines, the reaction of nitrogen dioxide formation may shift towards an increase in NO2. The formation of NO may be not affected by the increase in pressure by virtue of the fact that the reaction proceeds without changes in the amount. It has been determined that NO is the major atmospheric pollutant. However, it would be advisable to use more extensively the fuels characterized by the lowest output of nitrogen dioxide (methane and methanol), since nitrogen dioxide (NO2) related to the 2nd hazard class is appeared to be the most dangerous to humans. It has been revealed that the reduction in oxidation temperature using hydrogen as a fuel for electrochemical current generators may allow reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by more than an order of magnitude as compared to the best results for ICE. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Ethanol; Hydrogen; Methane; Methanol; Nitrogen oxides; Petroleum","Carburetors; Combustion chambers; Crude oil; Diesel engines; Equilibrium constants; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Gasoline; Hydrogen; Methane; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Atmospheric pollutants; Electrochemical currents; Equilibrium compositions; Excess air coefficient; Increase in pressure; Mass conservation equations; Nitrogen oxide emissions; Oxidation temperature; Hydrogen fuels","Shcheklein, S.E.; Ural Federal University Named After the First President of Russia B.N.

This article reviews the looming research on WAAM techniques and the commonly used metallic feedstock materials. The frequent defects that are produced in components during the WAAM process using different alloys are characterized including deformity, porosity, and cracking. Methods for enhancing the fabrication quality of the additively manufactured components are also discussed, with the consideration of the requirements of the distinct alloys. The implementation of the standardized Conventional Heat Treatment procedure to mitigate the defects in the WAAM process and in capturing the future possibilities that are efficient has been discussed. This paper concludes that the extensive application of WAAM still demonstrates many challenges, and these may need to be focused and solved in specific ways for different materials to produce an operational system in an acceptable time frame.

The improper disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) on open land is a burden to the government due to the health implications and the socioeconomic issues associated with it. In order to mitigate environmental degradation, health risk concern and public vexation, the study aims at identifying suitable sites for MSW disposal in Abuja Municipal Area Council and Bwari area council of Abuja which meets global specification and standards. The integration of Geospatial data: Landsat-7ETM+, NigeriaSat-X, ASTER-GDEM, base map, soil and geology maps and multi-criteria evaluation, was used to evaluate the relative importance of each criterion in the study. Each map layers were formed by using the spatial analysis potential of the ArcGIS10.1 software and final suitability map was created using the weighted overlay analysis. The results of the analysis identified six potential sites for sanitary landfill; however four out of the six sites were considered due to the land area size of the sites and its non-intersection with the Abuja land use plan. Also, results showed that none of the existing MSW disposal sites met the global standards considered. In view of the ecological and environmental challenges regarding MSW disposal sites in Abuja, this study shows that GIS is an effective tool in MSW management, which will assist decision makers to plan appropriately toward achieving an aesthetic, healthy and sustainable environment. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Dumpsite; GIS; Multi-criteria evaluation; Municipal solid waste; Sanitary landfill","GIS; health risk; land use change; land use planning; landfill; multicriteria analysis; municipal solid waste; software; spatial analysis; sustainable development; Abuja [Nigeria]; Nigeria","Aderoju, O.M.; Department of Geosciences, Rua Campo Alegre 687, Portugal; эл. почта: laideaderoju@gmail.com",,"Springer",1387585X,,EDSNB,,"English","Environ.

It has been proposed to expand everywhere the using of gas-cylinder cars in the transport complex. Russian legislation on the use of natural gas is analyzed. It has been established that the main criterion for increasing the fleet of gas-cylinder vehicles is the construction of gas stations. On the example of Tyumen (the Russian city), an experiment was conducted on the accounting of transit transport passing through its highways. It is concluded that an important aspect of sustainable urban development is the improvement of the environmental situation, including the using of natural gas as a motor fuel. And to expand its use, a rational territorial and quantitative location of the natural gas vehicle refilling stations is needed.

The graphs of changes in the parameters of the combustion process, heat release characteristics, and effective indicators are given. It is important to study the issues of converting diesel engines to natural gas, as diesel engine is the most common in the national economy. The most suitable way of converting diesel engines to natural gas is to implement a gas-diesel workflow, since it does not require a significant engine rework. Diesel D-245.7 was chosen as an object of study. In the course of the study, among other things, the load characteristics of this diesel engine were removed when working on the gas-diesel process. When analyzing the experimental data obtained for a gas-diesel process as compared to a diesel one, some features can be noted. The gas-diesel process shows an increase in the temperature and pressure of gases in the cylinder. Heat dissipation is much faster. This indicates the volumetric nature of the ignition and combustion of natural gas. Engine power during the transition to the gas-diesel process is maintained at the same level, while the consumption of diesel fuel due to replacement by natural gas is reduced several times. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Environmental technology; Gases; Ignition; Natural gas; Combustion pro-cess; Engine power; Heat release characteristic; Load characteristics; National economy; Temperature and pressures; Turbocharged diesel engine; Diesel engines","Grebnev, A.V.; Vyatka State Agricultural AcademyRussian Federation; эл. почта: lv99@mail.ru","Kovalev I.V.Voroshilova A.A.Borisova E.A.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17426588,,,,"English","J.

Although an increasing number of users can use natural gas, the coverage of the natural gas pipeline network remains low in some areas in China. A ""point supply"" pattern, which provides gas through liquefied natural gas (LNG), compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) supply stations, has been developed to solve the problem of gas unavailability in areas not covered by the pipeline network. This pattern flexibly supplies gas, whose cost is low and market determined. Thus, the substantial development of these gas supply stations has been promoted. This pattern will continue to play an important role in the future. However, no unified standards for the construction of these gas supply stations have been provided, resulting in various problems, such as unreasonable location, inadequate management, potential risk and imbalance between supply and demand. On the basis of these concerns, this research attempts to study the urban bearing capacity of gas supply stations, provide some new ideas for the construction and planning of urban gas supply stations, and help promote sustainable urban development. The pressure-state-response model is adjusted to the pressure-state-capability model, which is used as a basis for proposing an evaluation index system and calculation models for the comprehensive evaluation of the urban bearing capacity of gas supply stations on city and country scales. The proposed methodology is used in a case study of urban agglomerations in the Yangtze River Delta. © 2019 by the authors.","Bearing capacity; CNG stations; LNG stations; LPG stations; Press-State-Capacity model; Urban agglomerations in the Yangtze River Delta","agglomeration; bearing capacity; energy balance; gas pipeline; gas supply; liquefied natural gas; liquefied petroleum gas; pipeline; China; Yangtze Delta","Hong, J.; School of Journalism and Communication, China; эл. почта: hjwcn@whu.edu.cn",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083863413

In this paper, we determined the emission factors of primary pollutants and estimated the secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation potential of a China V heavy-duty diesel engine tested under ETC (European Transient Cycle) and ESC (European Stationary Cycle) with different types of fuels using an engine dynamometer. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emission factors were 55.7–121 mg/kwh, while primary PM emission factors were 15.0–26.8 mg/kwh. These values were substantially lower than those of older diesel vehicles that met pre-China V standards. Based on the SOA yields of the measured VOCs, the SOA formation potential of diesel engines were estimated to be 2.8–15.9 mg/kg fuel. The ratios of potential SOA/primary PM ranged from 0.07 to 0.16. We further showed that VOCs emission factors, SOA formation potential and the ratios of SOA/primary PM were highly dependent on the test cycle, whereas the primary PM emission factors on both test cycles and fuel quality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel particulate matter; Driving test cycles; Fuel quality; Secondary organic aerosol; vehicle emission; Volatile organic compounds","Aerosols; Air pollution; Diesel engines; Fuels; Gas emissions; Particulate emissions; Vehicles; Volatile organic compounds; Diesel particulate matters; Driving test cycle; Fuel quality; Secondary organic aerosols; Vehicle emission; Particles (particulate matter); fuel; volatile organic compound; aerosol formation; diesel engine; emission; exhaust emission; particulate matter; trace gas; volatile organic compound; Article; diesel engine; exhaust gas; particulate matter; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol","Jin, T.; Center for Urban Transport Emission Research, China; эл. почта: jints@nankai.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",13522310,,AENVE,,"English","Atmos.

Four isolated microbes with high machine oil degradation efficiency were selected to evaluate their characteristics on the oil degradation. All of them reached their highest oil degradation rate after 7 days of incubation. Most of them significantly increased their oil degradation rate by additional carbon or organic nitrogen source in the incubation medium.

Power-to-methane is one option for sector coupling in a future energy system. Here, a techno-economic analysis is presented that investigated different pathways with eight different scenarios. The first four use renewable hydrogen via electrolysis from wind combined with different CO2 sources, i.e., from biogas production, tail gas from power plants, provided by a supplier and from direct air capture. The remaining four scenarios based on conventional hydrogen and carbon dioxide sources are considered for the sake of comprehensive coverage. For all scenarios, a process analysis provides important insights. The economic analysis shows methane costs in the range of €3.51-€3.88 per kg for all optimized process schemes on the power to gas route. Therefore, no economic benefit can be achieved for a gas provider using power-to-methane in his gas grid. Nevertheless, with regard to the GHG reduction target of 80-95% through 2050, green solutions are of special interest. The results of the ecological analysis show a highly promising pathway that makes use of liquid manure. The avoidance of fertilizing soil by dispensing large amounts of liquid manure achieves improvements in acidification and eutrophication of soil and ground water. A switch from fossil diesel to fossil natural gas only yields a reduction of between 7%-22%. Good results were already achieved by applying municipal waste or dry manure offering an 87% GHG reduction. Liquid manure offers a credit of-78.1 g CO2,eq/MJf CH4 instead of GHG emissions on the order of 70.4 g CO2,eq/MJf CH4 using fossil CNG on a well-to-wheel basis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.","Methanation; Power to gas; Sector coupling; Techno economic analysis","Carbon dioxide; Electric power system economics; Energy resources; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Liquids; Manures; Methanation; Methane; Natural gasoline plants; Biogas production; Carbon dioxide sources; Ecological analysis; Economic benefits; Energy transitions; Renewable energies; Renewable hydrogens; Techno-Economic analysis; Economic analysis","Peters, R.; Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany; эл. почта: ra.peters@fz-juelich.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",22129820,,,,"English","J.

The dam, which was constructed 40 years ago, supplies water to many parts of the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area. To offset the impacts of potential dam failure due to seismic activities, as well as accidental and planned water spillages, about 100 m of lands around the dam and 30 m of riparian lands around River Densu were reserved. Despite planning prohibitions, these reservations have largely been encroached by homebuilders and business operators. Analyses of time-series rainfall data and hazard mapping showed that during periods of torrential rainfall, the dam and the river are overwhelmed with storm water hence exposing the Weija Township located downstream to flood hazards. Questionnaire surveys, in-depth interviews with selected homebuilders, and institutional consultations revealed that the spatial and institutional management dynamics, customary land ownership, along with the growing defiance of planning regulations were the key influences of floods in the Weija Township. The affected households have attempted to mitigate the effects of flooding by elevating structures with stones and sandbags, strengthening walls, constructing drains and pumping water out during flooding events, but with little success. However, given the lack of political will to remove the unauthorized structures constructed within the buffers and reservations, the challenge now is to minimize flood vulnerabilities by flood-proofing buildings, improving drains and channelizing portions of the river within the township. These structural measures should be complemented by flood vulnerability maps, early flood warning and evacuation systems, mandatory property insurance policies, and above all, improved institutional coordination and collaboration for flood management. The paper recommends a re-examination of Ghana’s urban land use planning and management of water bodies in urban areas. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Coping mechanisms; Encroachment; Flood vulnerability; Peri-urbanization; Terrain; Weija Dam","Construction industry; Dams; Flood control; Hazards; Insurance; Land use; Rain; Rivers; Surveys; Time series analysis; Urban planning; Water management; Coping mechanisms; Encroachment; Flood vulnerabilities; Peri-urbanization; Terrain; Floods","Owusu-Ansah, J.K.; Department of Planning, Ghana; эл. почта: koansah@msn.com",,"Springer Netherlands",03432521,,GEOJD,,"English","GeoJournal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055580062

In this study, the environmental and economic impacts of an integrated-state AD technology (i-AD) producing Compressed Natural Gas (noted as BioCNG) were investigated from dairy-manure, food-wastes, and miscanthus biomass feedstocks, and compared with that of stand-alone liquid-state (LS-AD) and solid-state (SS-AD) AD technologies. A coupled life-cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis (LCA‐TEA) approach was used to estimate the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of BioCNG ‒ a renewable alternative to fossil-CNG. The results illustrated that the Fossil Energy Ratios (FERs) for BioCNG were between 2.3 and 3.3 in the increasing order as LS‐AD &lt; i‐AD &lt; SS‐AD. The life-cycle GWPs to produce BioCNG via LS‐AD, SS‐AD, and i‐AD were −5.1, −15.1, and −12.0 kgCO2eq/GGE (Gasoline-Gallon-Equivalent) respectively. The MSP of BioCNG (without incentives) via LS‐AD ($2.9/GGE) was lower than that of both SS‐AD ($4.1/GGE) and i‐AD ($4.9/GGE). When the tipping-fee ($44/Mg), RIN(Renewable Index Number)-credit ($0.46/RIN), and carbon-credit($13.6/MgCO2eq) were considered, the MSP of BioCNG dropped by up to 70%, 45%, and 25% for LS‐AD, SS‐AD, and i‐AD, respectively.

The advantages and disadvantages of them complicate the decision-making process and compel us to develop adequate mathematical methods. Alternative fuel (compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and ethanol fuel mixtures), the standard prices and their ratios were investigated. A mathematical model to determine a critical ratio between alternative and conventional fuel prices had already been developed. The results of this were investigated. The results showed that the critical ratio is not a linear function on annual conventional fuel consumption costs. According to our simulation gaseous fuels were economically more attractive.

In this scenario, the purpose of the present research is to carry out an accurate and extensive LCA based analysis to compare the environmental impact, between conventional gasoline and hybrid vehicle powertrains. Two different powertrain scenarios were considered maintaining the same vehicle chassis. The performed analysis concerned resources and energy consumption as well as pollutant emission of each process, evaluating the impact of powertrain production, the vehicle use phase, and powertrain end of life scenarios. A large set of indicators-including human toxicity, eutrophication, and acidification-was considered. The study indicates that the potential of electrified vehicles basically depends on efficient production and recycling of the battery. We found that the conventional powertrain determines a higher Global Warming Potential (GWP) than hybrid powertrain (by almost 30%). Conversely, the water-related impact is higher in hybrid powertrain, and this is associated to the extraction and processing of the metal and mischmetal within the battery pack.

Abstract: Wild lima bean plants contain cyanogenic glycosides (CNGs) that are known to defend the plant against leaf herbivores. However, seed feeders appear to be unaffected despite the high levels of CNGs in the seeds. We investigated a possible role of CNGs in seeds as nitrogen storage compounds that influence plant growth, as well as seedling resistance to herbivores. Using seeds from four different wild lima bean natural populations that are known to vary in CNG levels, we tested two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: (1) seeds with higher levels of CNGs produce seedlings that are more resistant against generalist herbivores and, (2) seeds with higher levels of CNGs germinate faster and produce plants that exhibit better growth. Levels of CNGs in the seeds were negatively correlated with germination rates and not correlated with seedling growth. However, levels of CNGs increased significantly soon after germination and seeds with the highest CNG levels produced seedlings with higher CNG levels in cotyledons. Moreover, the growth rate of the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis was lower in cotyledons with high-CNG levels. We conclude that CNGs in lima bean seeds do not play a role in seed germination and seedling growth, but are associated with seedling defense. Our results provide insight into the potential dual function of plant secondary metabolites as defense compounds and storage molecules for growth and development. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cyanogenesis; Herbivory; Nitrogen storage; Secondary metabolites; Seed germination","cyanogenic glycosides; glycoside; nitrogen; animal; chemistry; genetics; germination; growth, development and aging; herbivory; immunology; metabolism; parasitology; Phaseolus; physiology; plant immunity; plant leaf; plant seed; secondary metabolism; seedling; Spodoptera; Animals; Germination; Glycosides; Herbivory; Nitrogen; Phaseolus; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaves; Secondary Metabolism; Seedlings; Seeds; Spodoptera","Benrey, B.; Institute of Biology, Rue Emile-Argand 11, Switzerland; эл. почта: Betty.Benrey@unine.ch",,"Springer Verlag",00320935,,PLANA,"31240396","English","Planta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068050209

A survey was conducted to obtain the opinion of vehicle drivers on environmental issues and on introduction of cleaner vehicles-hybrid and electric vehicles. The results show that the reason for small electric vehicle sales is the lack of recharging points and the high price. The production, life and recycling of batteries are the other major issues noted in the survey.

The effects of the amount of CNG added on the engine performance have been studied. Throughout the tests the effective performance and pollution emission indicators of ICE (Internal Combustion Engine), the cylinder pressure, etc. were measured. Under all operating conditions the diesel fuel consumption per hour and the rotation speed have remained constant. The amount of CNG added is variable. As a result of the research, relations have been established concerning the overall efficiency, the air to fuel ratio for steady-state performance and smoke opacity. An increase in CO, NOx and HC emissions has been recorded and at the same time the amount of CO2 released has decreased. Both the maximum pressure in the combustion chamber and the pressure rise rate increase which results in rising the engine performance harshness. When CNG has been added in quantity about 47% of the total amount of fuel, the peak value is achieved. The influence of the amount of added gas fuel on the calculated gross heat release rate has been determined. The maximum heat release rate does not change significantly. The nature of the combustion process does not change either. In conclusion, findings validate the possibility to achieve up to 30 % higher maximum rated power by adding 56% CNG mass fraction of the total amount of fuel. Provided the amount of CNG is up to 48% of the total amount of fuel, the ICE ecological indicators have not been deteriorated, furthermore the power has been increased by up to 20%. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Paraffin was selected as a base material in which the CuO-nanoparticle was dispersed. To check the thermal storage enhancement Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test was carried out. With the melting and solidification curve analysis we were able to infer that the latent thermal storage enhancement was increased drastically with the nanoparticle dispersed sample, than with the ordinary base material. The above nanofluid was subjected to laser flash analysis (LFA) to obtain the thermal conductivity enhancement rate.

In major cities and towns, it is most common private transport as it is fast and easy approach to the destination. But the prolonged drive in the two-wheeler leads to the potential health hazard and musco-skeletal disorder due to continuous exposure to the vibration caused during the ride and force transmitted to the vehicle body due to road irregularities. It is a challenge of automobile engineers to design a promising suspension system to overcome the risk of ride comfort during continuous driving. In this research, two-wheeler suspension system is modelled with a condition of bump and valley in a wavy road. The road surface is assumed to be wavy and the response of new suspension spring with different materials (stainless steel, tungsten and polymeric) along with viscous damper is analyzed and compared.

Numerous N-glycosylated proteins are found in the human gut, from both dietary and host sources, including immunoglobulins such as IgA that are secreted into the intestine at high levels. Here, we show that many mutualistic gut Bacteroides spp. have the capacity to utilize complex N-glycans (CNGs) as nutrients, including those from immunoglobulins. Detailed mechanistic studies using transcriptomic, biochemical, structural and genetic techniques reveal the pathway employed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) for CNG degradation. The breakdown process involves an extensive enzymatic apparatus encoded by multiple non-adjacent loci and comprises 19 different carbohydrate-active enzymes from different families, including a CNG-specific endo-glycosidase activity. Furthermore, CNG degradation involves the activity of carbohydrate-active enzymes that have previously been implicated in the degradation of other classes of glycan. This complex and diverse apparatus provides Bt with the capacity to access the myriad different structural variants of CNGs likely to be found in the intestinal niche. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"beta n acetylhexosaminidase; glucosaminidase; glycan; immunoglobulin; sialidase; bacterial protein; glycoprotein; polysaccharide; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterial survival; Bacteroides; Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; carbohydrate metabolism; cell surface; colon flora; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; gene control; gene locus; GH20 gene; intestine flora; nonhuman; periplasm; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein structure; RNA sequence; upregulation; Bacteroides; chemistry; enzymology; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene locus; genetics; growth, development and aging; human; intestine; metabolism; microbiology; symbiosis; X ray crystallography; Bacterial Proteins; Bacteroides; Crystallography, X-Ray; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genetic Loci; Glycoproteins; Humans; Intestines; Polysaccharides; Symbiosis","Bolam, D.N.; Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, United Kingdom; эл. почта: david.bolam@ncl.ac.uk",,"Nature Publishing Group",20585276,,,"31160824","English","Nat.

Abstract: Piriformospora indica, an endophytic basidiomycete, has been shown to increase the growth and improve the plants tolerance to stressful conditions, especially salinity, by establishing the arbuscular mycorrhiza-like symbiotic relationship in various plant hosts. In the present research, the effect of NaCl treatment (150 mM) and P. indica inoculation on growth, accumulation of nutrients, the transcription level of genes involved in ionic homeostasis (NHXs, SOS1 and CNGC15) and regulating water status (PIP1;2, PIP2;4, TIP1;1 and TIP2;2) in roots and leaves of tomato seedlings were investigated. The P. indica improved the uptake of N, P, Ca and K, and reduced Na accumulation, and had no significant effect on Cl accumulation in roots and leaves. The endophytic fungus also increased in K+/Na+ ratio in roots and leaves of tomato by regulating the expression of NHX isoforms and upregulating SOS1 and CNGC15 expression. Salinity stress increased the transcription of PIP2;4 gene and reduced the transcription of PIP1;2, TIP1;1 and TIP2;2 genes compared to the control treatment. However, P. indica inoculation upregulated the expression of PIP1;2 and PIP2;4 genes versus non-inoculated plants but did not have a significant effect on TIP1;1 and TIP2;2 expression. These results conclude that the positive effects of P. indica on nutrients accumulation, ionic homeostasis and water status lead to the increased salinity tolerance and the improved plant growth under NaCl treatment. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aquaporin; Ionic homeostasis; Lycopersicon esculentum; Mineral nutrition; Piriformospora indica; Salinity","potassium; sodium; water; Basidiomycetes; genetics; homeostasis; metabolism; microbiology; physiological stress; physiology; salinity; salt tolerance; symbiosis; tomato; Basidiomycota; Homeostasis; Lycopersicon esculentum; Nutrients; Potassium; Salinity; Salt Tolerance; Sodium; Stress, Physiological; Symbiosis; Water","Ghorbani, A.; Department of Biology, Iran; эл. почта: Ghorbani62a@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",07217714,,PCRPD,"31152194","English","Plant Cell Rep.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066504463

First, consumer-generated food waste is increasing monumentally since open dumping is still followed as a predominant practice, the negative environmental externalities associated with food waste disposal are growing beyond manageable proportions. Second, the dependency on conventional fuels like diesel to operate transit buses, which is one of the major causes for deteriorating urban air quality. A nexus established between food waste management and operation of transit buses can improve the sustainable performance of cities in developing nations. In this study, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) supported Social Cost-Benefit Analysis (SCBA) is performed by considering a hypothetical scenario of establishing a large food waste treating biomethanation plant in Mumbai, India. The food waste from the city is transported to a biomethanation plant where it is subjected to an anaerobic digestion (AD) process. The biogas produced as a byproduct is upgraded to compressed biomethane (CBM) and used as a vehicle fuel to operate transit buses within the city. The LCA results suggest that CBM buses can reduce greenhouse gas and particulate matter emissions by 60% compared to diesel or compressed natural gas (CNG) buses. Fossil depletion potential of CBM buses is 98% lower than diesel, suggesting CBM's importance in decoupling developing nations dependency on imported crude oil. The SCBA considers: (a) costs to stakeholders, i.e., fees for open dumping of food waste and cost of fuel for operating transit buses; and (b) social costs incurred by negative environmental externalities (obtained by monetizing LCA results) resulting from both, open dumping as well as fuel combustion. SCBA results indicate that the food waste-based CBM model can save 6.86 billion Indian rupees (USD 99.4 million) annually for Mumbai. The savings are made due to a reduction in stakeholder's costs (fuel) coupled with societal, i.e., environmental externality costs if entire transit bus fleet operates on CBM fuel instead of conventional fuel mix (33:67 diesel to CNG) currently used. Although the study is performed for Mumbai, the results will be replicable to any city of developing nations facing similar issues. © 2019 by the authors.","Compressed biomethane for transit buses; Food waste management in cities of developing nations; Life cycle assessment; Private and sustainable rate of returns; Social cost benefit analysis","anaerobic digestion; biogas; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; diesel engine; environmental economics; food web; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; methane; operations technology; India; Maharashtra; Mumbai","Upadhyayula, V.K.K.; Department of Chemistry, Sweden; эл. почта: krishna.upadhyayula@umu.se",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070478704

Whilst much effort has been made to prevent food waste, there is still a lack of attention and strategic approach in dealing with resource recovery and valorisation of food waste. This paper presents a systematic framework for sustainable organic waste management and valorisation in the UK through (i)review of current policy framework; (ii)analysis of resource recovery potential from food waste at national, community and organisational levels; (iii)proposition of alternative waste management strategies; and (iv)examination of challenges and opportunities with respect to economic, environment and social dimensions of sustainability of waste management strategies. The paper explores valorisation of source-segregated food waste and mixed waste from the supermarket and households into electricity and transportation fuels, through partially and completely decentralised configurations using anaerobic digestion and gasification technologies. This study demonstrates a potential for reducing the cost of electricity and greenhouse gas emissions of one supermarket store by 12% when adopting partially decentralised food waste anaerobic digestion strategy, and full substitution of fossil fuel based electricity with net surplus renewable electricity generation through complete decentralisation of mixed waste gasification. Therefore, a more integrated, circular and advanced technological approach in waste management should be undertaken as it can lead to a wider range of socio-economic and environmental advantages to the local community, highly essential in the UK. © 2019 The Authors","Anaerobic digestion; Circular economy; Food waste; Resource recovery; Systems thinking; Valorisation","Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Recovery; Retail stores; Sustainable development; Wastes; Circular economy; Food waste; Resource recovery; Systems thinking; Valorisation; Anaerobic digestion","Ng, K.S.; Department of Engineering Science, Parks Road, United Kingdom; эл. почта: kok.ng@eng.ox.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Perception of the generalist insect, Spodoptera litura, by Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) activates cytosolic Ca2+ elevation, which triggers downstream defense. However, not all the Ca2+ channels generating the signal have been identified, nor are their modes of action known. We report on a rapidly activated, leaf vasculature- and plasma membrane-localized, CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNEL19 (CNGC19), which activates herbivory-induced Ca2+ flux and plant defense. Loss of CNGC19 function results in decreased herbivory defense. The cngc19 mutant shows aberrant and attenuated intravascular Ca2+ fluxes. CNGC19 is a Ca2+-permeable channel, as hyperpolarization of CNGC19-expressing Xenopus oocytes in the presence of both cyclic adenosine monophosphate and Ca2+ results in Ca2+ influx. Breakdown of Ca2+-based defense in cngc19 mutants leads to a decrease in herbivory-induced jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine biosynthesis and expression of JA responsive genes. The cngc19 mutants are deficient in aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation and hyperaccumulate its precursor, methionine. CNGC19 modulates aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in tandem with BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID TRANSAMINASE4, which is involved in the chain elongation pathway of Met-derived glucosinolates. Furthermore, CNGC19 interacts with herbivory-induced CALMODULIN2 in planta. Together, our work reveals a key mechanistic role for the Ca2+ channel CNGC19 in the recognition of herbivory and the activation of defense signaling. © 2019 ASPB.",,"Arabidopsis protein; calcium; cyclopentane derivative; glucosinolate; jasmonic acid; messenger RNA; methionine; oxylipin; protein binding; animal; Arabidopsis; biological model; calcium signaling; cell membrane; cell membrane permeability; cytosol; down regulation; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; herbivory; metabolism; mutation; parasitology; physiology; plant leaf; signal transduction; Spodoptera; vascular bundle (plant); Xenopus; Animals; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Calcium; Calcium Signaling; Cell Membrane; Cell Membrane Permeability; Cyclopentanes; Cytosol; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucosinolates; Herbivory; Methionine; Models, Biological; Mutation; Oxylipins; Plant Leaves; Plant Vascular Bundle; Protein Binding; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction; Spodoptera; Xenopus","Vadassery, J.; National Institute of Plant Genome Research, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, India; эл. почта: jyothi.v@nipgr.ac.in",,"American Society of Plant Biologists",10404651,,PLCEE,"31076540","English","Plant Cell",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069620278

Among them, more attention has been paid to the use of the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) concept. The benefits of this combustion concept are the simultaneous reduction of fuel consumption, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and soot emission together with thermal efficiency improvement. However, there are still tough challenges in the successful operating of HCCI engines, such as controlling the combustion phasing, extending the operating rang, and high unburned hydrocarbon and CO emissions. In this study, experimental work were performed on a single cylinder engine and the simulation results were compared to the experimental data. The comparison showed the numerical data had a good agreement with experimental data. By increasing the ratio of reformer gas, the maximum pressure and maximum pressure rise rate are significantly increased. Keeping the air-fuel ratio constant and increasing the ratio of the reformer gas reduce the IMEP and heat efficiency, also increasing reformer gas blend fraction decreased HC and increased CO emissions considerably. In addition, using reformer gas expands the operating range lean limit and increases the possibility of engine well operation in this region. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Efficiency; Engine cylinders; Ignition; Nitrogen oxides; Combustion pro-cess; Experimental and numerical studies; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Homogeneous charge compression ignition engines; Simultaneous reduction; Single cylinder engine; Thermal efficiency improvements; Unburned hydrocarbons; Gas emissions","Pourfallah, M.; Mechanical Engineering Department, Iran; эл. почта: m.pourfallah@ustmb.ac.ir",,"Springer Verlag",09477411,,HMTRF,,"English","Heat Mass Transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053625842

Successful development of hydrogen economy means innumerable advantages for the environment, energy security, economy, and final users. One major key to wholly develop hydrogen economy is safe, compact, light and cost-efficient hydrogen storage. The conventional gaseous state storage system as pressurized hydrogen gas and liquid state storage system pose safety and cost problems to onboard applications; therefore, they do not satisfy the future goals for a hydrogen economy. Fortunately, solid-state storage systems based on metal hydrides have demonstrated great potentials to store hydrogen in large quantities in a quite secure, compact, and repeatedly reversible manner and thus, becoming increasingly attractive option for hydrogen applications. However, techno-economic feasibility of hydrogen storage systems is yet to be realized as none of the current metal hydrides fulfill all the essential criteria for a practical hydrogen economy, mainly because of low hydrogen storage capacity, sluggish kinetics and unacceptable temperatures of hydrogen absorption/desorption. This article gives a brief review of hydrogen as an ideal sustainable energy carrier for the future economy, its storage as the stumbling block as well as the current position of solid-state hydrogen storage in metal hydrides and makes a recommendation based on the most promising novel discoveries made in the field in recent times which suggests a prospective breakthrough towards a hydrogen economy. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Catalysis; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides; Nanoconfinement; Nanostructuring","Catalysis; Discovery wells; Energy security; Hydrides; Hydrogen fuels; Metals; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage capacities; Metal hydrides; Nano-structuring; Nanoconfinements; Solid state storage systems; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Techno-economic feasibility; Hydrogen storage","Abe, J.O.; Department of Chemical, South Africa; эл. почта: johnabe.fm@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",03603199,,IJHED,,"English","Int J Hydrogen Energy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065012566

Implementation of sustainable waste management in Zagreb should be performed through the introduction of source-separation of waste, and its utilization. One of the aspects is usage of biowaste as a feedstock for biomethane production. Produced biomethane could be distributed by dedicated network of filling stations within City area. The main objective of paper is presentation of environmental and economic benefits of proposed approach and citizen's involvement in separate collection of waste from households. In this sense, a survey has been conducted among residents in order to assess their behaviours regarding the separate collection of waste fractions. The main motivation is the reduction of waste fee, creation of new jobs, stimulation of local economy and biofuel production. This paper presented the fact that paper/cardboard, glass and packaging are most suitable waste fractions for separate collection, while biowaste is most demanding due to odours issue and lack of space.

Despite the crude oil price fluctuation, it has tended to increase. Moreover fossil fuel burning emits hazard compounds, including greenhouse gas. To solve them alternative fuels for vehicle have to be used. In due to properties, their usage impacts on the engine efficiency. The alternative fuel usage needs additional investment costs on the vehicle engines adaptation and fuel supply infrastructure. So, decisions must be based on mathematical apparatus. Three submodels were used in the suggested mathematical model: energy and economic indicator for fuels; energy and economic indicator for vehicles; criteria for investment projects. As a criterion of investment projects the profitability index has been grounded. The mathematical model and the algorithm for determining the feasibility of the alternative fuel utilization have been developed. The proposed algorithm includes the following stages: calculation of the fuel energy cost; calculation of the criteria for vehicles; determining the maximum value of investments; making decisions. Biofuels and gaseous fuels for some countries have been studied. The economic attractiveness of the alternative transport fuels has been presented. According to mathematical modeling, gaseous fuels are more economically attractive compared with liquid biofuels. Among gaseous fuels, LPG has a higher economic efficiency.

Sodium fertilization, which has been shown to promote eucalyptus growth compared to K-deficient trees, could partially mitigate this adverse effect of potassium. However, little is known about the influence of K and Na fertilization on the tree metabolic response to water deficit. The aim of the present study was thus to analyze the transcriptome of leaves sampled from Eucalyptus grandis trees subjected to 37% rainfall reduction, and fertilized with potassium (K), sodium (Na), compared to control trees (C). The multifactorial experiment was set up in a field with a throughfall exclusion system. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on leaves from two-year-old trees, and data analyzed using multifactorial statistical analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Significant sets of genes were seen to respond to rainfall reduction, in interaction with K or Na fertilization, or to fertilization only (regardless of the water supply regime). The genes were involved in stress signaling, primary and secondary metabolism, secondary cell wall formation and photosynthetic activity. Our focus on key genes related to cation transporters and aquaporins highlighted specific regulation of ion homeostasis, and plant adjustment to water deficit. While water availability significantly affects the transcriptomic response of eucalyptus species, this study points out that the transcriptomic response is highly dependent on the fertilization regime. Our study is based on the first large-scale field trial in a tropical region, specifically designed to study the interaction between water availability and nutrition in eucalyptus. To our knowledge, this is the first global transcriptomic analysis to compare the influence of K and Na fertilization on tree adaptive traits in water deficit conditions. © 2019 Favreau et al.

To date, no systematic review has assessed the effectiveness of interventions aiming to reduce ambient air pollution. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ambient particulate matter air pollution in reducing pollutant concentrations and improving associated health outcomes. Search methods We searched a range of electronic databases with diverse focuses, including health and biomedical research (CENTRAL, Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO), multidisciplinary research (Scopus, Science Citation Index), social sciences (Social Science Citation Index), urban planning and environment (Greenfile), and LMICs (GlobalHealth Library regional indexes, WHOLIS). Additionally, we searched grey literature databases, multiple online trial registries, references of included studies and the contents of relevant journals in an attempt to identify unpublished and ongoing studies, and studies not identified by our search strategy. The final search date for all databases was 31 August 2016. Selection criteria Eligible for inclusion were randomized and cluster randomized controlled trials, as well as several non-randomized study designs, including controlled interrupted time-series studies (cITS-EPOC), interrupted time-series studies adhering to EPOC standards (ITSEPOC), interrupted time-series studies not adhering to EPOC standards (ITS), controlled before-after studies adhering to EPOC standards (CBA-EPOC), and controlled before-after studies not adhering to EPOC standards (CBA); these were classified as main studies. Additionally, we included uncontrolled before-after studies (UBA) as supporting studies. We included studies that evaluated interventions to reduce ambient air pollution from industrial, residential, vehicular and multiple sources, with respect to their effect on mortality,morbidity and several air pollutant concentrations.We did not restrict studies based on the population, setting or comparison. Data collection and analysis After a calibration exercise among the author team, two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted data extraction, risk of bias assessment and evidence synthesis only for main studies; we mapped supporting studies with regard to the types of intervention and setting. To assess risk of bias, we used theGraphic Appraisal Tool for Epidemiological studies (GATE) for correlation studies, as modified and employed by the Centre for Public Health Excellence at the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). For each intervention category, i.e. those targeting industrial, residential, vehicular and multiple sources, we synthesized evidence narratively, as well as graphically using harvest plots. Main results We included 42 main studies assessing 38 unique interventions. These were heterogeneous with respect to setting; interventions were implemented in countries across the world, but most (79%) were implemented in HICs, with the remaining scattered across LMICs. Most interventions (76%) were implemented in urban or community settings. We identified a heterogeneous mix of interventions, including those aiming to address industrial (n = 5), residential (n = 7), vehicular (n = 22), and multiple sources (n = 4). Some specific interventions, such as low emission zones and stove exchanges, were assessed by several studies, whereas others, such as a wood burning ban, were only assessed by a single study. Most studies assessing health and air quality outcomes used routine monitoring data. Studies assessing health outcomes mostly investigated effects in the general population, while few studies assessed specific subgroups such as infants, children and the elderly. No identified studies assessed unintended or adverse effects. The judgements regarding the risk of bias of studies were mixed. Regarding health outcomes, we appraised eight studies (47%) as having no substantial risk of bias concerns, five studies (29%) as having some risk of bias concerns, and four studies (24%) as having serious risk of bias concerns. Regarding air quality outcomes, we judged 11 studies (31%) as having no substantial risk of bias concerns, 16 studies (46%) as having some risk of bias concerns, and eight studies (23%) as having serious risk of bias concerns. The evidence base, comprising non-randomized studies only, was of low or very low certainty for all intervention categories and primary outcomes. The narrative and graphical synthesis showed that evidence for effectiveness was mixed across the four intervention categories. For interventions targeting industrial, residential and multiple sources, a similar pattern emerged for both health and air quality outcomes, with essentially all studies observing either no clear association in either direction or a significant association favouring the intervention. The evidence base for interventions targeting vehicular sources was more heterogeneous, as a small number of studies did observe a significant association favouring the control. Overall, however, the evidence suggests that the assessed interventions do not worsen air quality or health. Authors’ conclusions Given the heterogeneity across interventions, outcomes, and methods, it was difficult to derive overall conclusions regarding the effectiveness of interventions in terms of improved air quality or health.Most included studies observed either no significant association in either direction or an association favouring the intervention, with little evidence that the assessed interventions might be harmful. The evidence base highlights the challenges related to establishing a causal relationship between specific air pollution interventions and outcomes. In light of these challenges, the results on effectiveness should be interpreted with caution; it is important to emphasize that lack of evidence of an association is not equivalent to evidence of no association. We identified limited evidence for several world regions, notably Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Southeast Asia; decision-makers should prioritize the development and implementation of interventions in these settings. In the future, as new policies are introduced, decision-makers should consider a built-in evaluation component, which could facilitate more systematic and comprehensive evaluations. These could assess effectiveness, but also aspects of feasibility, fidelity and acceptability. The production of higher quality and more uniform evidence would be helpful in informing decisions.

The stalemate between the rapid development of the vehicle industry and delayed vehicle emission control has become increasingly prominent. Vehicle emission has become a significant source of air pollution in China’s cities. Understanding the current barriers in the vehicle industry is necessary for the development of effective and sustainable measures and policy to manage vehicle-induced air pollution. This review provides insight into the circumstances and causes of vehicle-induced air pollution and outlines recent progress in policy-makers’ long-term strategies and regulations. The development of an integrated mechanism of social participation, technical revolution, and regulatory innovation in vehicles, fuel, and roads is suggested to break the stalemate between air pollution and the automobile boom in China; the implications of this review extend to other countries facing the similar atmospheric pollution problems.

Their habitat is shared by other nematodes, by beneficial and harmful bacteria, and nematode-trapping fungi. Not surprisingly, these nematodes can detect and discriminate among diverse environmental cues, and exhibit sensory-evoked behaviors that are readily quantifiable in the laboratory at high resolution. Their ability to perform these behaviors depends on,100 sensory neurons, and this compact sensory nervous system together with powerful molecular genetic tools has allowed individual neuron types to be linked to specific sensory responses. Here, we describe the sensory neurons and molecules that enable C. elegans to sense and respond to physical stimuli. We focus primarily on the pathways that allow sensation of mechanical and thermal stimuli, and briefly consider this animal’s ability to sense magnetic and electrical fields, light, and relative humidity. As the study of sensory transduction is critically dependent upon the techniques for stimulus delivery, we also include a section on appropriate laboratory methods for such studies. This chapter summarizes current knowledge about the sensitivity and response dynamics of individual classes of C. elegans mechano-and thermosensory neurons from in vivo calcium imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology studies. We also describe the roles of conserved molecules and signaling pathways in mediating the remarkably sensitive responses of these nematodes to mechanical and thermal cues. These studies have shown that the protein partners that form mechanotransduction channels are drawn from multiple superfamilies of ion channel proteins, and that signal transduction pathways responsible for temperature sensing in C. elegans share many features with those responsible for phototransduction in vertebrates. © 2019 Goodman and Sengupta.","C.Elegans; Mechanosensation; Thermosensation; WormBook","calcium; ion channel; Article; avoidance behavior; behavior; body surface; Caenorhabditis elegans; calcium cell level; cytoskeleton; epidermis; extracellular matrix; humidity; laboratory technique; mating; mechanical stimulation; mechanical stress; mechanoreceptor; mechanotransduction; neurite; nociception; nonhuman; phototransduction; physical stimulation; priority journal; proprioception; sensory nerve cell; signal transduction; thermal stimulation; thermoreceptor; touch; whole cell patch clamp; animal; Caenorhabditis elegans; mechanics; mechanotransduction; metabolism; physiological stress; physiology; sensation; signal transduction; temperature; temperature sense; Animals; Caenorhabditis elegans; Mechanical Phenomena; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Sensation; Sensory Receptor Cells; Signal Transduction; Stress, Physiological; Temperature; Thermosensing","Goodman, M.B.; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, United States; эл. почта: mbgoodmn@stanford.edu",,"Genetics Society of America",00166731,,GENTA,"31053616","English","Genetics",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065647064

The targets include: a) reducing the adverse environmental impact of cities (target 11.6), b) providing access to green spaces (target 11.7) and c) promoting resource-use efficiency in cities (target 11b). Nevertheless, cities, especially those in the global south, are struggling to sustain agriculture due to rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation. How to maintain (peri-) urban agriculture in cities and their peripheries in an era of increasing land scarcity is unclear in the conventional literature. In this regard, this study set out to determine appropriate practices globally that can foster the sustenance of urban and peri-urban agriculture and determine their applicability to the Ghanaian context. Even though Ghana remains the focus of the discussion, the generality of the characteristics of the cities in Sub-Saharan Africa makes the practices useful to Sub-Saharan African region. The study obtained the required data, through a review of literature, from databases such as Scopus, PubMed, MeSH and ProQuest. The authors complemented the literature from these conventional sources with literature from grey sources such as institutional websites and online media publications. The results of the literature review show that container gardening, backyard gardening, and farming on vacant lands and marginal lands can hold the key to preserving agriculture within the cities. However, these models are more appropriate for the production of vegetables and herbs. Therefore, urban and peri-urban agriculture may concentrate on the production of herbs and vegetables, to complement the food supply from rural agriculture. The Purchase of Development Right and expropriation and zoning of peri-urban land for agricultural purposes appear to be important strategies for promoting access to land for peri-urban agriculture. The strategies call for revisions of city legislation and the land use planning process to legitimise and promote agriculture in cities and their peripheries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Land access; Land scarcity; Sustainable cities; Urban and peri-urban agriculture; Urbanisation in Ghana","land use; land use planning; literature review; periurban area; sustainability; urban agriculture; urbanization; Ghana; Scopus","Amponsah, O.; Department of Planning, Ghana; эл. почта: o.amponsah.cap@knust.edu.gh",,"Elsevier Ltd",02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063349067

Methanol (MeOH) is one such product, and is one of the most widely used chemicals, employed as a feedstock for ≈30% of industrial chemicals. The starting materials are analogous to those feeding natural processes: water, CO 2 , and light. Innovative technologies from this effort have global significance, as they allow GHG recycling, while providing society with a renewable carbon feedstock. Light, in the form of solar energy, assists the production process in some capacity. Various solar strategies of continually increasing technology readiness levels are compared to the commercial MeOH process, which uses a syngas feed derived from natural gas. These strategies include several key technologies, including solar-thermochemical, photochemical, and photovoltaic–electrochemical. Other solar-assisted technologies that are not yet commercial-ready are also discussed. The commercial-ready technologies are compared using a technoeconomic analysis, and the scalability of solar reactors is also discussed in the context of light-incorporating catalyst architectures and designs. Finally, how MeOH compares against other prospective products is briefly discussed, as well as the viability of the most promising solar MeOH strategy in an international context. © 2019 The Authors.

Ltd., a subsidiary of thinkstep AG, Mumbai, India","Abstract: A comparative life cycle energy and environmental inventory has been developed for public road transport modes in metropolitan regions in India. The environmental performance of public bus transport (PBT) and intermediate public transport (IPT) modes, viz. taxi and auto-rickshaw, in Mumbai Metropolitan Region has been assessed and compared at off-peak, average and peak levels of vehicle occupancy. Moreover, the environmental performance of vehicles adhering to Bharat Stage (BS) emission norms has been assessed. The inventory captures both vehicle operation (tail-pipe emissions) and non-operation components (e.g. vehicle manufacturing, vehicle maintenance and fuel production). GaBi 6.5 has been used to assess the environmental impact in terms of global warming, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical ozone creation, abiotic depletion potential and primary energy demand. The functional unit of the study was defined as passenger kilometre travelled in 15 years, the service lifetime of the vehicle. The results show that tail-pipe emissions dominate the life cycle environmental impact of PBT (75% of 17.2 g CO2-eq/PKT), taxi (78% of 85 g CO2-eq/PKT) and auto-rickshaw (78% of 78 g CO2-eq/PKT). However, in case of vehicles adhering to BS-VI stringent emission norms, vehicle non-operation components dominate the life cycle environmental impact of public road transport modes. Therefore, vehicle non-operation components should be considered while addressing the environmental performance of public road transport modes. For all three occupancy levels, PBT is environment-friendly compared to IPT modes. However, the break-even point assessment highlights that the bus services should be operated with at least 11 passengers to make its global warming potential equivalent to IPT modes. In case of shared services of the taxi and auto-rickshaw, this equivalency increases to 23 and 29 passengers, respectively. Eventually, this study provides the benchmark that can lead regional transport planners to more informed and prioritized mitigation measures for improving the environmental footprint of public transportation in metropolitan regions in India.

In the present opinion, the CONTAM Panel concluded that this ARfD is applicable for acute effects of CN regardless the dietary source. To account for differences in cyanide bioavailability after ingestion of certain food items, specific factors were used. Estimated mean acute dietary exposures to cyanide from foods containing CNGs did not exceed the ARfD in any age group. At the 95th percentile, the ARfD was exceeded up to about 2.5-fold in some surveys for children and adolescent age groups. The main contributors to exposures were biscuits, juice or nectar and pastries and cakes that could potentially contain CNGs. Taking into account the conservatism in the exposure assessment and in derivation of the ARfD, it is unlikely that this estimated exceedance would result in adverse effects. The limited data from animal and human studies do not allow the derivation of a chronic health-based guidance value (HBGV) for cyanide, and thus, chronic risks could not be assessed. © 2019 European Food Safety Authority.

These consumer activity forces the industry to maintain the environment, and it began to trouble them to balance the monetary and economy against the social and environment factors while manufacturing. Thus, researchers are encouraged to develop new techniques to tackle these issues. The suggested technique should optimally maintain the environments issue and provide reasonable profit. Hence in this work, it aims to motivate unit manufacturing process to boost green manufacturing by effectively minimizing the resource. Surface grinding is one of the real time experimentations conducted in most of the industries. By penetrating greenness in the surface grinding, the environment hazard can effectively reduce. Thus in this paper, the unit process is used in the surface grinding, to effectively use the lubricant. An artificial intelligent optimization technique is proposed to control the various factors, which influence the greenness of the unit process in surface grinding.

To investigate their real-world gaseous emissions, we applied portable emissions measurement systems (PEMSs) to test 44 gasoline and 24 bi-fuel taxis in seven cities. Our real-world measurement results indicated that a major part of the tested China 3 and China 4 gasoline taxis, especially the samples with high mileage (&gt;300,000 km), far exceeded the corresponding emission limits of NOX, THC and CO. Only the newest China 5 gasoline taxis with relatively lower mileage had effective emission controls and the gaseous emissions were below the limits. Illegal tampering, malfunction and deterioration of three-way catalytic converters (TWC) are major reasons for high emissions from high-mileage taxis. First, China 4 gasoline taxis without TWC (purposely removed by drivers) increased their gaseous emissions than TWC-equipped counterparts by more than one order of magnitude. Second, bi-fuel taxis when using compress natural gas (CNG) had much higher NOX and THC emissions than those when using gasoline, which might be probably attributed to unsophisticated engine calibration and unfavorable TWC working conditions. Furthermore, TWC renewal could bring immediate and substantial emission reductions (up to 70%) for high-mileage taxis. However, such benefits from TWC renewal would become less significant as the mileage levels further increase. We also found a good correlation between CO and THC emissions for gasoline taxis, whose cold start effects were both significant. This study poses significant concerns regarding real-world emissions of high-mileage taxi fleets in China, which could consist of many gross emitters in the urban areas. Stringent in-use compliance programs and in particular frequent TWC renewals for high-mileage taxis should be implemented by policy makers in China. © 2018","Compressed natural gas (CNG); Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Real driving emissions (RDE); Taxi; Three-way catalyst (TWC)","Air pollution; Catalytic converters; Compressed natural gas; Deterioration; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Taxicabs; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Real drivings; Taxi; Three way catalysts; Air pollution control equipment; fuel; gasoline; natural gas; nitric oxide; tetrahydrocannabinol; carbon monoxide; emission control; emission inventory; natural gas; nitrogen oxides; policy implementation; pollution policy; traffic emission; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; calibration; China; concentration (parameters); correlational study; environmental factor; mileage; priority journal; taxi fleet; traffic and transport; urban area; China","Wu, Y.; School of Environment, China; эл. почта: ywu@tsinghua.edu.cn",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"30599345","English","Sci.

Knowledge of the genetic and genomic basis of these behaviors is therefore integral to a causal understanding of speciation. Acoustic behaviors are often part of the mating ritual in animal species. The temporal rhythms of mating songs are notably speciesspecific in many vertebrates and arthropods and often underlie assortative mating. Despite discoveries of mutations that disrupt the temporal rhythm of these songs, we know surprisingly little about genes affecting naturally occurring variation in the temporal pattern of singing behavior. In the rapidly speciating Hawaiian cricket genus Laupala, the striking species variation in song rhythms constitutes a behavioral barrier to reproduction between species. Here, we mapped the largest-effect locus underlying interspecific variation in song rhythm between two Laupala species to a narrow genomic region, wherein we find no known candidate genes affecting song temporal rhythm in Drosophila. Whole-genome sequencing, gene prediction, and functional annotation of this region reveal an exciting and promising candidate gene, the putative cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel-like gene, for natural variation in mating behavior. Identification and molecular characterization of the candidate gene reveals a nonsynonymous mutation in a conserved binding domain, suggesting that ion channels are important targets of selection on rhythmic signaling during establishment of behavioral isolation and rapid speciation. © 2019 by the Genetics Society of America.","Behavioral barrier; Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel; Genetic architecture; Interspecific variation; Laupala","cyclic nucleotide gated channel; cyclic nucleotide gated channel; insect protein; Article; assortative mating; Drosophila; evolution; genetics; genotype; genus; Laupala; music; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; quantitative trait locus mapping; singing; single nucleotide polymorphism; species differentiation; whole genome sequencing; animal; genetic variation; genetics; Gryllidae; male; molecular evolution; physiology; reproductive isolation; sexual behavior; vocalization; Animals; Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Speciation; Genetic Variation; Gryllidae; Insect Proteins; Male; Reproductive Isolation; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Vocalization, Animal","Xu, M.; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, United States; эл. почта: mx52@cornell.edu",,"Genetics Society of America",00166731,,GENTA,"30647070","English","Genetics",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062592750

Four scenarios were analyzed: two conventional scenarios that examined the impacts of using diesel as a vehicle fuel with typical LFG management practices and two that assessed the advantages/disadvantages of using LFG as a feedstock for producing two types of alternative vehicle fuels. Producing LFG-derived compressed natural gas (CNG) or electricity as an alternative fuel source for the fleet is generally found to be significantly more economically and environmentally advantageous than practicing one of the more conventional scenarios, especially as the value of financial incentives (e.g. RINs) increase. The LFG-to-CNG scenario offers the greatest financial benefit when these incentives are high. However, when financial incentives are not available, this scenario is not feasible to undertake in the system modeled, but an LFG-to-electricity scenario could still save $1.32 for every gallon of diesel that is replaced with the alternative fuel. Using LFG-derived electricity as a vehicle fuel substitute also offers greater financial benefits than using the same volume of LFG for more commonplace purposes, such as generating electricity that is fed to the grid. Additionally, from the LCA, this scenario has the lowest global warming potential of all four scenarios analyzed, with over a 50-fold reduction in CO2-equivalent emissions over the baseline scenario. © 2018","Compressed natural gas; Economic analysis; Electric vehicles; Electricity; Landfill gas; Life-cycle assessment","Alternative fuels; Biogas; Compressed natural gas; Economic analysis; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Electricity; Finance; Fleet operations; Gases; Global warming; Land fill; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Natural gas vehicles; Natural gasoline plants; Alternative vehicle fuels; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Economic and environmental assessments; Environmental life cycle assessment; Global warming potential; Landfill gas; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste (MSW); Renewable energy resources; compressed natural gas; diesel fuel; fuel; natural gas; unclassified drug; economic analysis; electric vehicle; environmental assessment; environmental economics; landfill; life cycle analysis; management practice; municipal solid waste; natural gas; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; economic aspect; electricity; energy conversion; environmental management; financial management; landfill; life cycle assessment; motor vehicle; waste","Townsend, T.G.; Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences, P.O.

The non-return-to-base nature of long-haul trucks requires a large natural gas refueling infrastructure, for which the costs and benefits have not yet been assessed. This paper assesses the spatial distribution, capacity, and economic feasibility of a national natural gas refueling infrastructure for long-haul trucks in the United States. For a small share of natural gas-powered trucks in the total fleet (1%-5%), a national liquefied natural gas (LNG) refueling infrastructure would require from 105 to 193 refueling stations at a capital investment of $263-$483 million (assuming a truck range of 320-960 km or 200-600 mi). The share of LNG trucks has to be greater than 15.2% (assuming the minimum truck range is 320 km or 200 mi), 12.4% (480 km or 300 mi), or 9.5% (960 km or 600 mi), so that the national infrastructure achieves net profits for baseline economic assumptions [$0.05=diesel gal. equivalent (DGE) profit margin, 7% discount rate, and 20 years]. Building a national compressed natural gas (CNG) refueling infrastructure requires more investment because a fast-fill CNG refueling station costs more and has lower capacity compared to an LNG counterpart. However, the CNG refueling infrastructure achieves better economic returns due to a higher assumed profit margin ($0.1=DGE). As the diesel price has the largest effect on the adoption of natural gas trucks, plans to build natural gas refueling infrastructures face significant challenges during times of low diesel prices. A practical strategy is to first target regional highway networks (such as those in California and Texas) to take advantage of high truck activities within regions, favorable market conditions, and supportive government policies. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Automobiles; Costs; Economic analysis; Fleet operations; Gases; Investments; Liquefied natural gas; Profitability; Trucks; Capital investment; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Costs and benefits; Economic feasibilities; Economic viability; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); National infrastructure; Natural gas price; Compressed natural gas; cost-benefit analysis; feasibility study; liquefied natural gas; spatial distribution; transportation infrastructure; trucking; United States","Tong, F.; Dept. of Engineering and Public Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave., United States; эл. почта: ftong@carnegiescience.edu",,"American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)",10760342,,,,"English","J.

Further, the effects of metro services on reducing CCE were explored, and comparative analysis on CCE between the inner sprawling suburbs and outer suburbs was conducted. It was found that: (i) the increases in CCE are several times larger than the increases in urban size, population, and economic developments; (ii) metro services reducing CCE near metro stations is not statistically significant, maybe because the proportions of car users near the metro stations are similar to the two cities’ average levels, which is caused by their higher household income and the longer travel time using the metro; (iii) in Beijing, there are smallest CCE in the outer suburbs due to job-housing balances, short distance and large percentage of non-motorized mode uses while largest CCE in the inner sprawl suburbs due to car trips with long distance. These findings indicate that to cope with the rapidly increasing CCE, more attention should be paid to developing strong industry and real-estate simultaneously; the improvement in the feeder bus and public bicycle systems should also be reinforced to reduce the total travel time of metro users; and satellite cities with job-housing balance are greatly needed. The implications will benefit efforts to reduce CCE and mitigate global climate change, and they also provide empirical evidence and reference values for other global cities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; China; Transport CO 2 emission by commuters; Travel pattern; Urban sprawl; Xi'an","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Housing; Rail motor cars; Real time systems; Subway stations; Travel time; Beijing; China; CO2 emissions; Travel patterns; Urban sprawl; Xi'an; Urban transportation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; commuting; comparative study; empirical analysis; travel time; urban development; urban sprawl; urban transport; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Shaanxi; Xian","Wang, Y.; Department of Traffic Engineering, P.O.

The trend was pushed by the state administrations of mainly EU countries and international organizations seeing LNG as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to diesel. Different infrastructural projects for the widespread use of LNG in transport have been launched around the world. The main goal of this paper was to analyze use of LNG as a fuel for heavy trucks. Different aspects of LNG chain were analyzed along with economical and ecological benefits of LNG application. Filling stations network for LNG were described for the purpose of comparative analysis of diesel and LNG heavy trucks. Conclusion has shown that using LNG as propellant fuel has numerous advantages over the use of conventional fuels. The higher initial investment of the LNG road vehicles could be amortized in their lifetime use, and in the long-term they are more affordable than the classic diesel vehicles. In addition to cost-effectiveness, LNG road vehicles reduce CO 2 emissions. Therefore, the environmental goals in transport, not only of the member states but worldwide, could not be met without LNG in heavy truck traffic. © 2019 by the authors.","Alternative fuels; Heavy truck traffic; Liquefied natural gas (LNG); Road transport","Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Cost effectiveness; Gas fuel purification; Natural gas transportation; Natural gas wells; Roads and streets; Truck transportation; Trucks; Comparative analysis; Ecological benefits; Environmentally friendly alternatives; Heavy-truck traffic; International organizations; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Road transports; State administration; Liquefied natural gas","Sedlar, D.K.; Faculty of Mining, Pierottijeva 6, Croatia; эл. почта: daria.karasalihovic-sedlar@rgn.hr",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061851491

Both physical/ chemical and biological technologies are available for the treatment of CH4 emissions, the later also allowing for the production of high-added value products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) at significantly lower raw material costs. Among CH4 biotechnologies, turbulent contactors such as stirred tank reactors or bubble column bioreactors have been the most employed for the methanotrophic production of PHAs under nutrient-limited conditions. However, the moderate biomass productivities achieved at the expense of high energy consumption in these systems has headed the most recent research towards the development of new bioreactor configurations and the implementation of strategies to enhance CH4 mass transfer, such as the internal gas recycling or the use of non-aqueous phases. Also, the specificity of type II methanotrophs to accumulate these bioproducts, mainly as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), has stimulated the development of novel enrichment procedures based on modifications in the nitrogen source and concentration, the oxygen content, the pH and the composition of micronutrients (e.g. Cu2+) to effectively select this type of methanotrophs. Finally, current research is focused on the use of co-substrates during methanotrophic cultivation to increase PHA yields and modify the composition of the biocomposite, thus enhancing the thermal and mechanical properties of the product and boosting its widespread production at industrial-scale. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

Pot experiments were conducted with five treatment groups, including control(CK, unfertilized), conventional nitrogen fertilizer(CN), A. sinicus + nitrogen fertilizer(CNG) A. sinicus + organic fertilizer + nitrogen fertilizer(CNGO), and A. sinicus + biochar-based fertilizer + nitrogen fertilizer(CNGC). The ef- fects of different fertilization treatments on the growth of early-season rice, Wuyou 156, were evaluated in uncontaminated and contaminat? ed soil, and the Cu absorption and transportation processes were examined in rice organs. The results showed that, compared with the CN treatment, the grain yield increased by 47.1% and 50.1% in uncontaminated and contaminated soil, respectively, with the CNG treatment. Compared with the CNG treatment, the CNGC treatment only increased the grain yield by 4.5% and 12.8% in uncontaminated and contami- nated soil, respectively. Under the application of inorganic fertilizer, Cu concentrations were the highest in rice roots and the total absorbed Cu was also at its maximum. In contaminated soil, there was a risk of heavy metal(Cu)pollution in brown rice for the CNG treatment; howev- er, the Cu content of brown rice for the CNGC treatment was lower than the related food hygiene standard(10.0 mg·kg-1). Further results in- dicated that the Cu transporting capacity from root to straw was clearly enhanced under the conditions of ploughed A. sinicus, while the Cu transporting capacity from straw to husk was inhibited in Cu-contaminated soil. Moreover, in contaminated soil, the mass fraction of avail- able Cu was at its maximum for the CN treatment. Compared with the CN treatment, the mass fraction of available Cu in soil for the CNGC treatment was reduced by 39.4%. Compared with the CK treatment, the mass fraction of available Cu in soil for the CNGC treatment was re- duced by 17.6%. In summary, in the case of ploughed A. sinicus, a fertilization method that uses a biochar-based fertilizer combined with a chemical fertilizer not only increased rice yield but also inhibited rice Cu absorption and transportation processes, thus reducing the Cu con- tent of rice grains. Thus, such a fertilization method could be applied for the improvement and remediation of Cu in contaminated rice soil. © 2019 Editorial Board of Journal of Agro-Environment Science.

A variety of feedstocks can be combined with different digestion techniques that each yields biogas with different trace compositions. California is expanding biogas production systems to help meet greenhouse gas reduction goals. Here, we report the composition of six California biogas streams from three different feedstocks (dairy manure, food waste, and municipal solid waste). The chemical and biological composition of raw biogas is reported, and the toxicity of combusted biogas is tested under fresh and photochemically aged conditions. Results show that municipal waste biogas contained elevated levels of chemicals associated with volatile chemical products such as aromatic hydrocarbons, siloxanes, and certain halogenated hydrocarbons. Food waste biogas contained elevated levels of sulfur-containing compounds including hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans, and sulfur dioxide. Biogas produced from dairy manure generally had lower concentrations of trace chemicals, but the combustion products had slightly higher toxicity response compared to the other feedstocks. Atmospheric aging performed in a photochemical smog chamber did not strongly change the toxicity (oxidative capacity or mutagenicity) of biogas combustion exhaust. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Anaerobic digestion; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Carbon dioxide; Feedstocks; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Indicators (chemical); Manures; Municipal solid waste; Renewable energy resources; Silicon compounds; Sulfur dioxide; Toxicity; Waste incineration; Biogas production systems; Chemical and biologicals; Combustion products; Greenhouse gas reductions; Halogenated hydrocarbons; Photochemical smog chambers; Renewable energy source; Sulfur containing compound; Biogas; biofuel; methane; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; California; food; manure; waste disposal; Anaerobiosis; Biofuels; Bioreactors; California; Food; Manure; Methane; Refuse Disposal","Kleeman, M.J.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, United States; эл. почта: mjkleeman@ucdavis.edu",,"American Chemical Society",0013936X,,ESTHA,"31479247","English","Environ.

In the conditions of Russia's fast-growing vehicle fleet, it is necessary to develop and implement effective measures to reduce the consumption of scarce oil fuels and stimulate the use of alternative eco-friendly fuels. The aim of this work is to assess the prospects for the use of alternative fuels and energy by cars in Russia. This paper outlines the main ways of reducing the gasoline and diesel fuel consumption by road transport, including the use of the motor fuel alternative types. As the most promising direction of alternative energy development in the road transport sector regarding Russia's conditions, a transition to gas-cylinder fuel is proposed. This study presents the main problems of road transport gasification and the ways to solve them.

Signalized traffic intersections are considered as urban hotspots due to their high air pollution levels which generally exceed the air quality standards specified by the regulatory agencies. The high air pollution levels mainly result from the idling of a large number of motor vehicles at these signalized intersections resulting in fuel losses and corresponding emissions leading to deteriorating air quality. There are ~950 signalized traffic intersections in Delhi city. A large number of the population works and lives close to these traffic intersections and are exposed to these air pollutants. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand the spatial-temporal distribution of vehicular emissions resulting because of the idling of motor vehicles at these intersections. In the present study, the fuel loss estimation due to the idling of vehicles was carried out at Lodhi Road intersection using idling fuel consumption data carried out on various test vehicles representing the Delhi traffic. The fuel loss was converted into emissions using fuel-based Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors. The emissions have been estimated in terms of greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions and indirect greenhouse gas (CO, NOx, and NMVOC). The results indicated that daily there was ~230 litre of petrol, ~100 litre of diesel and ~170 kg of compressed natural gas (CNG) loss due to idling at Lodhi Road intersection. The resultant emissions load estimated was ~1300 kg of CO2, 13 kg of NOx, 90 kg of CO per day. The spatial extent of vehicular pollutant has been assessed with the help of the CAL3QHC model. © 2019 WIT Press","CAL3QHC model; Emissions; Fuel loss; Idling; Signalized intersection",,,,"WITPress",1746448X,,,,"English","WIT Trans.

Preferably, these challenges are addressed with broad and interconnected solutions with the ambition of addressing several challenges simultaneously, in this paper referred to as multi-functional urban solutions. Implementation of multi-functional urban solutions requires well informed decisions, supported by knowledge about the potential contributions that the solutions can make to a more sustainable city as well as on issues that may hinder or facilitate their implementation. Thus, in this paper, we suggest a soft multi-criteria decision analysis method that can be used to gather and structure this knowledge. This method acknowledges the importance of incorporating local knowledge, is based on life-cycle thinking, and is flexible and open-ended by design so that it can be tailored to specific needs and conditions. The method contributes to existing practices in sustainability assessment and feasibility studies, linking and integrating potential and performance assessment with issues affecting solutions' feasibility of implementation. This method offers a way for local authorities, researchers and exporting companies to organize and structure the diverse range of knowledge to be considered for more informed decisions regarding the implementation of multi-functional urban solutions.

However, when the amount of data is large or the relationships between data are complex, traditional algorithms for movement patterns between zones become ineffective. We propose a new agglomeration algorithm, namely, the density-based movement patterns between zones (DBMPZ), to mine spatial clustering of movement patterns. To validate the proposed algorithm, we use a real-world dataset of subway commuters in Shanghai and some synthetic datasets to identify movement patterns between zones. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively mine movement patterns between zones with high precision, effectiveness, and efficiency. In addition, the proposed algorithm can also play an important role in other regions or types of transportation dataset by modifying the clustering procedure. © 2013 IEEE.","Movement pattern mining; spatial clustering; subway networks; zone analysis","Railroads; Urban transportation; Zoning; Clustering procedure; Movement pattern; Spatial clustering; Subway network; Synthetic datasets; Targeted advertisements; Transportation dataset; Transportation development; Clustering algorithms","Ji, G.; School of Computer Science and Technology, China; эл. почта: glji@njnu.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067261868

Optical and scanning electron microscope, an X-ray diffractometer with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, micro-hardness and digital surface roughness measuring testers are used to analyse the characterisation of both the unirradiated and irradiated specimens. The high surface micro-hardness is formed in the laser irradiated region of the sample during laser shock peening (LSP). In this case, high dislocation densities can produce. The LSP method involves with recoil pressure loading at the sample surface with minimum heating effects in the laser treated region. Hence in this work, the LSP of Ni–Cr and Co–Cr alloys is investigated to understand the influence of a power density, pulse density, pulse duration and irradiated laser spot diameter on the treated layer characteristics. The micro-hardness data is compared using ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey test. It is observed that the selected laser parameters have significant influence on the resulting surface characteristics.

The overall mean of total BTEX in all sites tested in this study was 5.21 µg/m 3 and it was found that the toluene level was the highest in all monitored sites. In terms of seasonal variations, BTEX concentrations were slightly higher in the winter than in the summer. This is plausibly due to higher chemical removal reaction rates of BTEX and to dust storm in the summer that eventually removes BTEX from the atmosphere. The diurnal patterns showed high records of BTEX concentrations in the morning (07:00–8:00 h) and during rush hours (19:00–21:00 h) in the evening, due to high volume of traffic and weak atmospheric dispersion and photochemical reactivity. Low records of BTEX concentrations were detected during midday, probably due to the high rate of photochemical reactions, to the increased mixing depth, to the upshifting of the urban boundary layer, and to the decreased traffic volume. Benzene/Toluene (B/T) and Xylene/ethylbenzene (X/E) ratios suggested that vehicular emissions were the main source of BTEX. Since individual pollutant exposure is associated with cancer risk (CR), BTEX concentrations are far from being safe for the population residing in these urban cities. According to individual hazard quotient (HQ), there is no serious threat of chronic non-cancer health effects in specific target organs for the urban cities population. A quite extensive review of BTEX in atmosphere was presented and it was found that the amount of BTEX in Kuwait was among the lowest compared with that of other cities in the world. © 2019, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","BTEX in ambient air; Health risk assessment; Seasonal and diurnal variations; Source apportionment; Spatial distribution",,"Al-Harbi, M.; Department of Environmental Technology Management, P.O.

Electric mobility is a potential solution to reduce the carbon footprint of city public transport. This paper analyzes the feasibility of this and computes the life cycle cost (LCC) of the procurement and operation of electric as opposed to diesel buses based on a functional unit of one bus driven 100 km per day. The research indicates that the total cost of ownership (TCO) of an electric bus, calculated over a life cycle of 25 years, is 5-10% less compared to a diesel bus. Sensitivity analysis is performed for the TCO of the electric bus in order to prepare a robust case to accommodate market fluctuations and the research assumptions. Component-wise analysis indicates several potential measures that may be taken to improve the viability and feasibility of electric buses. The research goal is to enable decision-making on the adoption of electric mobility by respective urban local bodies.

It was recently shown that other sources of molecular variations such as those resulting from transcripts or metabolites could be used to accurately predict complex traits. These endophenotypes have the advantage of capturing the expressed genotypes and consequently the complex regulatory networks that occur in the different layers between the genome and the phenotype. However, obtaining such omics data at very large scales, such as those typically experienced in breeding, remains challenging. As an alternative, we proposed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a high-throughput, low cost and non-destructive tool to indirectly capture endophenotypic variants and compute relationship matrices for predicting complex traits, and coined this new approach ""phenomic selection"" (PS). We tested PS on two species of economic interest (Triticum aestivum L. and Populus nigra L.) using NIRS on various tissues (grains, leaves, wood). We showed that one could reach predictions as accurate as with molecular markers, for developmental, tolerance and productivity traits, even in environments radically different from the one in which NIRS were collected. Our work constitutes a proof of concept and provides new perspectives for the breeding community, as PS is theoretically applicable to any organism at low cost and does not require any molecular information. © 2018 Montesinos-López et al.","Genomic; GenPred; Near InfraRed; Poplar; Prediction; Resources; Shared Data; Spectroscopy (NIRS); Wheat breeding endophenotypes","article; breeding; endophenotype; human; near infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; omics; Populus nigra; prediction; productivity; proof of concept; Triticum aestivum; wheat; genetics; genotype; plant breeding; Populus; proof of concept; quantitative trait; Genotype; Plant Breeding; Populus; Proof of Concept Study; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Triticum","Segura, V.; BioForA, France; эл. почта: vincent.segura@inra.fr",,"Genetics Society of America",21601836,,,"30373914","English","G3 Genes Genome Genet.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058146479

In this paper, the tribological properties of ferrous-based reinforcements are tested and compared with aluminum alloy (EN AlSi10Mg) as a base material for cylinder of air compressor. The ball-on-plate CSM tribometer is used to carry out these tests under dry sliding conditions and constant sliding distance, for three different values of sliding speed and normal load. The wear factor is analyzed by using Taguchi method as well as artificial neural network-based model, with the aim of finding the optimal parameters. The result of signal-to-noise ratio and analysis of variance shows that the best tribological properties were achieved with reinforcements. Material has the greatest impact on the wear factor (35.54%), followed by load (22.16%) and sliding speed (6.01%).

One of the causes is the presence of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) which is emitted by human activities. Oil and gas production (drilling, work over, and refinery) for energy consume will be followed by the associated gas. The associated gas will be flared due to safety and non-economic reasons. The objectives of this study are reviewing the environmental impact and utilize technologies from flaring gas. The impact of flaring gas can lead to a decrease in human health, increased GHG, changing the plant metabolism, and decrease the production of agricultural crops. Due to these, there are some technologies to reduce flaring such as: reinjection (EOR activities), PNG, LPG, LNG, CNG, NGH, GTE, and GTL.

Many helminths infect their hosts via an active, sensory-driven process in which environmentally motile infective larvae position themselves near potential hosts. For these helminths, host seeking and host invasion can be divided into several discrete behaviors that are regulated by both host-emitted and environmental sensory cues, including heat. Thermosensation is a critical sensory modality for helminths that infect warm-blooded hosts, driving multiple behaviors necessary for host seeking and host invasion. Furthermore, thermosensory cues influence the host-seeking behaviors of both helminths that parasitize endothermic hosts and helminths that parasitize insect hosts. Here, we discuss the role of thermosensation in guiding the host-seeking and host-infection behaviors of a diverse group of helminths, including mammalian-parasitic nematodes, entomopathogenic nematodes, and schistosomes.

A 2 × 2 factorial design was used for the trial. Two hundred and forty one-day-old female broilers were randomly assigned to four treatments: (1) negative-control broilers were fed by a basal diet and saline (NG); (2) positive-control broilers were fed by a basal diet and orally challenged with 108 CFU E. coli K88 (CNG); (3) ABP group broilers were fed by a basal diet containing ABPS (500 mg/kg of feed) and saline; (4) CABP group broilers were fed by a basal diet containing ABPS (500 mg/kg of feed) and orally challenged with 108 CFU E. coli K88. Growth performance, serum biochemical indexes, immune responses, intestinal mucosal morphology, and cecal microbial community structure were evaluated. The ABP group had greatest body weight (BW), average daily body weight gain (ADG), and intestinal villus height compared to other treatments (p &lt; 0.05). The CABP group had a higher villus height/crypt depth ratio (V/C) compared with other treatments (p &lt; 0.05). The expression levels of NF-κB were lower in the ABP group. The CNG group had higher Escherichia coli and Enterococcus contents in cecal samples compared to other treatments (p &lt; 0.05). Serum glucose, uric acid, TNF-α, and Secretory Immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) levels were higher in broilers challenged with E. coli (p &lt; 0.001) than that with saline. Broilers challenged with E. coli had reduced taxa richness in the cecal samples. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in cecal samples revealed that a lower proportion of Firmicutes and a higher proportion of Proteobacteria were detected in the broilers challenged with E. coli. Compared with the controls, dietary ABPS supplementation increased serum total protein, albumin, and S-IgA levels, but decreased serum glucose, uric acid, and TNF-α levels in broilers (p &lt; 0.05). Diet supplemented with ABPS increased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and the abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, and altered cecal microbiota community structure. These results suggest that ABPS can promote growth performance and improve intestinal morphology and microbiota community structure in broilers challenged with E. coli K88. © 2018 by the authors.","Achyranthes bidentata polysaccharides; Cecal microbiota; Escherichia coli K88; Immune response; Intestinal mucosal morphology","Anthropometry; Body fluids; Dietary supplements; Glucose; Immune system; Morphology; Organic acids; Polysaccharides; RNA; Broiler chickens; Community structures; Expression levels; Growth performance; Immune response; Microbial community structures; Microbiotas; Negative control; Escherichia coli","He, J.; College of Animal Science and Technology, China; эл. почта: jianhuahy@hunau.net",,"MDPI AG",20734360,,,,"English","Polym.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056099735

Because of its relatively compact structure and its direct access to amygdalar and hypothalamic nuclei, the accessory olfactory pathway provides an ideal system to study sensory control of complex mammalian behavior. During the last several years, many studies employing molecular, behavioral, and physiological approaches have significantly expanded and enhanced our understanding of this system. The purpose of the current review is to integrate older and newer studies to present an updated and comprehensive picture of vomeronasal signaling and coding with an emphasis on early accessory olfactory system processing stages. These include vomeronasal sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ, and the circuitry of the accessory olfactory bulb. Because the overwhelming majority of studies on accessory olfactory system function employ rodents, this review is largely focused on this phylogenetic order, and on mice in particular. Taken together, the emerging view from both older literature and more recent studies is that the molecular, cellular, and circuit properties of chemosensory signaling along the accessory olfactory pathway are in many ways unique. Yet, it has also become evident that, like the main olfactory system, the accessory olfactory system also has the capacity for adaptive learning, experience, and state-dependent plasticity. In addition to describing what is currently known about accessory olfactory system function and physiology, we highlight what we believe are important gaps in our knowledge, which thus define exciting directions for future investigation. © 2018 The Author(s).","accessory olfactory bulb; accessory olfactory system; pheromones; social behavior; vomeronasal organ; vomeronasal sensory neurons","formylpeptide receptor like protein; receptor; unclassified drug; vomeronasal type 1 receptor; vomeronasal type 2 receptor; pheromone; pheromone receptor; accessory olfactory bulb; accessory olfactory system; adaptive learning; chemoreceptor; experience; functional connectivity; human; learning; nerve projection; nervous system parameters; nonhuman; olfactory bulb; olfactory system; phylogeny; priority journal; protein expression; protein family; Review; sensory nerve cell; sensory stimulation; signal detection; signal transduction; state dependent plasticity; stimulus response; vomeronasal chemoreceptor; vomeronasal organ; animal; axon; cytology; mouse; nerve cell; odor; physiology; signal transduction; Animals; Axons; Mice; Neurons; Olfactory Bulb; Pheromones; Receptors, Pheromone; Signal Transduction; Smell; Vomeronasal Organ","Spehr, M.; Department of Chemosensation, Worringerweg 3, Germany; эл. почта: m.spehr@sensorik.rwth-aachen.de",,"Oxford University Press",0379864X,,CHSED,"30256909","English","Chem.

A public health emergency was declared. Delhi's smog was the result of an existing ambient urban air-pollution problem, significantly worsened by smoke blowing in from numerous agricultural fires burning across neighbouring Punjab and Haryana states. Post-summer monsoon regional air-flow patterns, decreasing autumn temperatures, high-pressure stability, temperature inversion and light local winds helped to produce climatic conditions that were conducive to smog build-up and subsequently prevented it from readily dispersing. Well-intentioned measures introduced by the authorities saw only partial improvement in city air quality after three weeks.

These last years, the role of epigenetics in the response to environmental variations has been established in several model plants at the genotype level but little is known at the level of natural populations grown in pedoclimatic sites. Here, we focused on three French natural populations of black poplar, a key pioneer tree from watersheds, planted in common garden and subjected to controlled variations of water availability. We estimated common genetic parameters such as narrow-sense heritability (h2), phenotypic differentiation index (PST), and the overall genetic differentiation index (FST) from genome-wide SNPs to evaluate the extent of epigenetic variations. Indeed, global DNA methylation levels from individuals exposed to drought or irrigated in a common garden were used. We found that the three populations were not distinguished by their levels of DNA methylation. However, a moderate drought was associated to a significant decrease in DNA methylation in the populations. Narrow-sense heritability and PST estimates of DNA methylation were similar to those found for biomass productivity. Heritability and PST were higher when trees were subjected to drought than in control condition. Negative genetic correlations between global DNA methylation and height or biomass were detected in drought condition only. Altogether, our data highlight that global DNA methylation acts as a genetic marker of natural population differentiation under drought stress in a pedoclimatic context. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","DNA methylation; FST; h2; PST; Poplar; Water availability",,"Maury, S.; LBLGC, France; эл. почта: stephane.maury@univ-orleans.fr",,"Springer Verlag",16142942,,,,"English","Tree Genet.

Two light-duty diesel trucks (LDDTs) and two heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs) filled with four mixed fuels with blend ratios of 0% (neat diesel), 5% (B5), 20% (B20), and 100% (B100) (biodiesel in traditional fossil diesel) were tested. The results show that the total fuel consumption (biodiesel + traditional fossil diesel) did not clearly decrease, but blending biodiesel into traditional fossil diesel could clearly decreased the consumption of traditional fossil diesel, reduce the countries’ dependence on oil imports. Converting waste cooking oil into biofuel and blending with diesel is a three-win alternative, dealing simultaneously with greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, food security, and energy security. The CO, HC, NOX and PM2.5 emissions for all of the tested vehicles decreased with increasing biodiesel content in the blend, with the exception of PM2.5 and NOX for D3, the NOX emissions showed a decrease with increasing biodiesel content in the blend for most vehicles in this study. The effect of emission reduction for all biodiesel blending proportions under highway (HW) condition is better than that under Non-highway (NHW) condition. The degree of reduction in CO, HC, NOX, and PM2.5 emission increased with increasing biodiesel content in the blend under HW section. Under the NHW section, the emission factors for lower biodiesel blend proportions (below 12.5%) especially for B5 were higher than those for neat diesel. The biodiesel blend reduced CO, HC, NOX and PM2.5 emissions compared with neat diesel under different driving modes except for individual condition (especially for B5 under acceleration mode).

We argue that this should mainly be reflected in the concentrations of defense compounds in the plant parts that are used for consumption and not necessarily for other parts of crop plants. We tested this hypothesis for domesticated lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), by comparing its chemical defenses against a leaf herbivore, the beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua), and a seed predator, the beetle Zabrotes subfasciatus. For seeds and leaves we determined the concentrations of cyanogenic glycosides (CNGs) in cultivated varieties and wild populations and evaluated the preference and performance of the herbivores when exposed to leaves and seeds from wild and cultivated plants. Concentrations of CNGs were significantly different between wild and cultivated plants. In the leaves the concentration of CNGs in the cultivated varieties were more than double that of the wild leaves. In contrast, seeds from cultivated plants had up to 20 times lower CNG concentration compared to seeds from the wild populations. Insect preference and performance do not parallel the chemical data. Larvae of S. exigua preferred wild leaves but had higher survival on cultivated leaves. The beetles, however, strongly preferred seeds from cultivated plants and females developed more quickly on these seeds. We conclude that domestication of P. lunatus has altered the concentration of CNGs in both the seeds and the leaves in opposite directions. This results in differential effects on the herbivores that attack these two plant structures. The contrasting effect of domestication on different plant tissues can be explained by the fact that bean plants have been specifically selected for human consumption of the seeds. Tissue-specific effects of plant domestication on plant defenses can be expected for other crops as well. © 2018 Gesellschaft für Ökologie","Cyanogenic glycosides; Domestication; Herbivore; Seed predator",,"Benrey, B.; Institute of Biology, Rue Emile-Argand 11, Switzerland; эл. почта: Betty.Benrey@unine.ch",,"Elsevier GmbH",14391791,,BAEAC,,"English","Basic Appl.

Ireland has the highest number of newly registered diesel vehicles in Europe with a share of 43.57% in the overall fleet which is expected to increase to 73.9% by 2025. This will have significant health and financial impacts, especially in the urban areas. The present study quantifies the environmental, financial and health burdens from cars, Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs) and buses in Dublin under the existing conditions and estimates the potential impact of the increasing numbers of diesel cars, LCVs and buses following the current trend projected over the next decade. As a preventative measure, the present study examines the impact of banning diesel vehicles older than 20 years from 2018 through the initiation of a phase-out policy. Furthermore, the impacts of a policy to ban new diesel vehicle sales from the year 2025 is also estimated. In both future scenarios, the preventative measures show significant savings in terms of reductions in NOx and PM2.5 emissions which were found to be 47% and 52% respectively in the year 2030 compared to the year 2015 levels. Additionally, this reduction will amount to savings of 300 DALYs and €43.8 million.

We show that C. elegans avoids Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) in part by detecting PA14-produced NO. PA14 mutants deficient for NO production fail to elicit avoidance and NO donors repel worms. PA14 and NO avoidance are mediated by a chemosensory neuron (ASJ) and these responses require receptor guanylate cyclases and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels. ASJ exhibits calcium increases at both the onset and removal of NO. These NO-evoked ON and OFF calcium transients are affected by a redox sensing protein, TRX-1/thioredoxin. TRX-1’s trans-nitrosylation activity inhibits the ON transient whereas TRX-1’s de-nitrosylation activity promotes the OFF transient. Thus, C. elegans exploits bacterially produced NO as a cue to mediate avoidance and TRX-1 endows ASJ with a bi-phasic response to NO exposure. © Hao et al.",,"cyclic nucleotide; guanylate cyclase; nitric oxide; recombinant DNA; thioredoxin; virulence factor; agents interacting with transmitter, hormone or drug receptors; thioredoxin; Article; avoidance behavior; behavior; Caenorhabditis elegans; fluorescence microscopy; gene expression; gene mutation; nitrosylation; nonhuman; Pseudomonas infection; radiation exposure; sensory nerve cell; transgene; animal; animal behavior; Caenorhabditis elegans; calcium signaling; chemoreceptor cell; drug effect; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; protein processing; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Caenorhabditis elegans; Calcium Signaling; Chemoreceptor Cells; Neurotransmitter Agents; Nitric Oxide; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Thioredoxins","Zhang, Y.; Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, United States; эл. почта: yzhang@oeb.harvard.edu",,"eLife Sciences Publications Ltd",2050084X,,,"30014846","English","eLife",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052069368

The growth of compressed natural gas as an alternative fuel to petrol and diesel can be accelerated by implementing strategies that result in the economical operation of the distribution infrastructure. Economic scheduling of power consumption is a useful strategy for reducing the cost of energy for both industrial and domestic consumers who operate in time-of-use based electricity pricing environments. In this paper, an optimal energy management strategy is proposed for the operation of a compressed natural gas fuelling station. The compressor energy consumption, being the main component of the total operating cost of the fuelling station, presents a cost saving opportunity through which optimal scheduling of operation can be used to lower cost of operation of the station. The developed model shows potential average savings of 59.3% in daily electricity costs while maximizing compressor life through minimization of compressor cycling. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Compressed natural gas; Demand response; Fast-fill; Optimization","Carbon dioxide; Compressors; Costs; Diesel engines; Energy management; Energy utilization; Fueling; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Global warming; Natural gas vehicles; Natural gas wells; Optimization; Propulsion; Scheduling; Carbon dioxide emissions; Cost of operations; Demand response; Economic scheduling; Economical operation; Electricity pricing; Optimal scheduling; Time-of-use tariffs; Compressed natural gas; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; demand analysis; diesel engine; economic conditions; electricity; energy planning; natural gas; optimization; price determination; strategic approach","Zhang, L.; Centre of New Energy Systems, South Africa; эл. почта: lijun.zhang@up.ac.za",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

As ever larger amounts of electricity are produced to support overall economic growth, this creates environmental justice challenges as people in the coal-producing areas are exposed to perilous air pollution levels. Federal technocrats shape the environmental governance of coal, prioritizing energy security and de-emphasizing the environmental health risks associated with coal extraction and processing. We argue that these technocrats render the pollution technical to continue the expansion of the nation's energy supply. In response, pollution-affected people in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh increasingly attempt to take technical approaches to contest high levels of pollution to counter the government's claims about acceptable levels of pollution. This tactic relies on an increased ability to counter expert pollution data collection and analysis. The approach requires connections with wider civil society networks who have the technical and legal knowledge required to quantify and judicially contest air pollution practices. Given conditions of great regulatory uncertainty in spite of well-developed legal norms, we conclude that a strategy based on long-term community cohesion and awareness-building, combined with independent air pollution monitoring by the impacted stakeholders, are crucial for sustained coal pollution mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Coal; Environmental justice; India; Judicialization",,"Oskarsson, P.; Swedish University of Agricultural SciencesSweden; эл. почта: patrik.oskarsson@slu.se",,"Elsevier Ltd",2214790X,,,,"English","Extr.

The increase in the demand for alternative fuel is currently driven by the requirement of decreasing engine fuel consumption and fulfilling the stringent engine exhaust emissions pollutant regulations. In order to effectively tackle the aforementioned concerns, it appears that through engine experimental analysis alone for both engine performance and exhaust emissions is insufficient. Recently, the need for engine modelling based on statistical and machine learning methodologies through response surface and artificial neural network technique, respectively, are non-trivial to provide a better decision support analysis. Therefore, the present study reviews the extent to which the application of these methods in various alternative fuel in both spark and compression ignition engine to investigate their viability. The paper also describes herein the ways to determine the accuracy and the significance of model fitting for both methodologies. It was demonstrated from the review that most of the research yield favourable results of engine modelling prediction for both of the methods.

New technologies are diffusing into the vehicle fleet in response to fuel efficiency and emission standards. Fuel economy and emissions regulations have been effective in reducing total emissions of key pollutants. Real-world fuel use and emissions are consistent with official values in the US but not in Europe or countries that adopt European standards. Portable emission measurements systems, which revealed a recent emissions cheating scandal, have a key role in regulatory programs to ensure conformity between “real driving emissions” and emission standards. The global vehicle fleet will experience remarkable growth, especially in Asia. Vehicles emit precursors to several important secondary pollutants, including ozone and secondary organic aerosols, which requires a multipollutant emissions and air quality management strategy. Gasoline and diesel are likely to persist as key energy sources to mid-century.

This article aims to capture the more recent progress made by the oil palm industry and to discuss the possible path research and development will take in the coming years. In 2017, palm oil and palm kernel oil production recorded close to one-third (75.17 million tonnes) of world total oils and fats production from a planted area of 19.04 million hectares, mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia. Malaysian palm oil alone fetched RM 46.12 billion export revenue from its India and European Union markets. The continuous growth of the industry is made possible through implementation of key strategies covering the whole process chain, from upstream to downstream. Intensified mechanisation, integrated pest and Ganoderma management, advanced breeding and biotechnology as well as good agricultural practices help boost oil palm yields for both plantations and smallholdings. In the palm oil milling sector, focus such as by-products valorisation, biogas (productivity, trapping and utilisation as a form of energy) and wastewater management, i.e. palm oil mill effluent for final discharge compliance ensures that the industry meets its sustainable goals. Palm oil is generally used for edible purpose, however about 20% goes into higher value non-food applications such as palm biodiesel. The beneficial nutritional aspects of palm oil are evident based on its positional distribution and fatty acids composition, while its quality enhanced via technology integration/mitigation and analytical elucidations. Facing strong competition from petrochemicals, palm-based oleochemicals are strategically aimed at producing value-added products for niche and new markets. It is apparent that synergising conventional and disruptive technologies at every level of the palm oil supply chain is desirable and essential to thrust the industry forward. As a commodity, palm oil has not only emerged as an important food source, but has proven to be effectively utilised for feed, fuels and chemicals, to name a few, in developing a sustainable and balanced circular economy. © 2018 Lembaga Minyak Sawit Malaysia.

The ownership of CNG vehicles in China has ranked the first in the world for many years. However, due to difficulties such as approval of land, CNG filling stations are difficult to meet the increasing demand for refueling. Therefore, the boxplot method was used to study more than 0.25 million CNG refilling records from a secondary CNG filling station in Tianjin to improve the refilling efficiency in this article. The study found that there were about 2.5% abnormal refilling behaviors based on volume, initial pressure and final pressure separately. To verify those results, another unsupervised learning method of kernel density estimation was used to estimate the probability density of each attribute. Finally, it was found that repeated refilling actions were the main reasons of abnormal behaviors detected based on volume attribute. The results suggested that the way to reduce abnormal CNG refilling behaviors was to avoid repeated refilling actions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Filling stations; Probability density function; Site selection; Abnormal behavior; CNG vehicles; Empirical studies; Final pressure; Initial pressure; Kernel Density Estimation; Probability densities; Unsupervised learning method; Unsupervised learning","Li, Y.; College of Engineering and Technology, China; эл. почта: liyang005@163.com",,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Results showed that a significant decrease in moisture content, organic carbon, available nitrogen, and potassium was observed in nearby road side soils. However, pH was observed to be on neutral side and available phosphorus recorded high concentration. The concentration of heavy metals Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ estimated was also significantly high. Furthermore, concentration of Pb2+ at high vehicular load subzones was observed to be highest (1.168 mg/Kg) followed by Zn2+ (0.896 mg/Kg), Ni2+ (0.649 mg/Kg), Cu2+ (0.415 mg/Kg), and Cd2+ (0.079 mg/Kg). An inter-zone analysis revealed that the concentration of the heavy metals (Pb2+ &gt; Ni2+ &gt; Cd2+) was observed to follow the trend, Z-I &gt; Z-II &gt; Z-III.

PAH derivatives are components with hydrogen on the aromatic ring substituted by carbonyl-, nitro- and hydroxyl-functional groups (N-PAH, O-PAH or OH-PAH), or a group of heterocyclic PAHs containing one sulfur atom in place of a carbon atom in the aromatic ring. PAHs and their derivatives can be either introduced in the atmosphere directly in this form as primary pollutants, or formed by homogenous and heterogeneous oxidation reactions. During the last decades, interest on studying PAH derivatives has increased because derivatives may be more harmful than parent compounds. PAH derivatives have been detected in the atmospheric particulate matter in numerous cities worldwide. PAH derivatives enter living organisms by inhalation, oral ingestion and dermal contact. In vivo and in vitro experiments together with epidemiological studies have shown the toxic effects of PAH derivatives, notably for compounds present in airborne and diesel exhaust particles. Here we review the sources, the mechanisms of formation, the physicochemical properties, the analytical methods, and the toxicological effects of PAHs and their derivatives in airborne particulate matter. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","N-PAHs; O-PAHs; OH-PAHs; Particulate matter; PASHs; Toxicity",,"Abbas, I.; Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission – NCSRLebanon; эл. почта: imane.abbas@cnrs.edu.lb",,"Springer Verlag",16103653,,,,"English","Environ.

According to different usage processes, we set three scenarios including S1-hydrogen production, S2-electricity generation, and S3-vehicle fuel to evaluate their environmental impacts. Furthermore, in order to satisfy better city development, an optimization analysis was made to identify the optimal distribution structure of LNG. Methods: The environmental impact analysis of LNG was conducted using life cycle assessment and CML2001 method. LCA was performed based on the ISO 14040 standard using GaBi 5.0 software. Four impact categories (i.e., global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), and photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP)) were considered. Sensitivity analysis was also made by means of GaBi 5.0 software. Crystal Ball software was applied to make the optimization analysis for different LNG usage scenarios. The minimum environmental impact factor was taken as the objective function to confirm the optimal distribution structure of LNG. Results and discussion: The LCA results indicate that the environmental impacts of the gasification and usage stages far outweigh that of the transportation stage, and the highest environmental impact category for each scenario is GWP. The largest contribution factor to GWP of S1 is the production supply of imported electricity, whereas the largest contribution factor to GWP of S2 and S3 is the emissions. The optimization analysis indicate that when imported LNG is allocated 25% for hydrogen production, 73% for electricity generation and 2% for vehicle fuel, the GWP and cost of the total LNG usage are both minimum. Conclusions: Environmental analysis on different LNG usage scenarios allows the identification and selection of comprehensive LNG usage plans with the minimum environment impacts and lowest cost. For different LNG usage scenarios, the GWP of LNG used for vehicle fuel is the highest and for hydrogen production is the lowest. The production supply of imported electricity and the emissions are the two largest contribution factors to LCA results as well as the sensitivity analysis results of the three scenarios. The optimization analysis method and results can provide technology reference for scientific urban planning of LNG application and allocation. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment; Liquefied natural gas (LNG); Optimization analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Usage","fuel; hydrogen; liquefied natural gas; ozone; acidification; Article; city; city planning; controlled study; electricity; environmental impact; eutrophication; exhaust gas; gasification; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; motor vehicle; photochemical ozone creation potential; photochemistry; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; software; technology","Zhang, Y.; Key Laboratory of Industrial Ecology and Environmental Engineering (MOE), China; эл. почта: zhangyun@dlut.edu.cn",,"Springer Verlag",09483349,,IJLCF,,"English","Int.

Transit agencies have planned to add a significant number of alternative-fuel buses to their current transit fleets. This study is to inform policy makers who may allocate public funds for alternative-fuel bus projects to make a smarter decision in this regard. For each of the eight alternative-fuel buses, technologies introduced by the ACT, fuel efficiency, life-cycle cost (LCC) and emission are estimated and compared with the available information for the ultralow-sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel buses. A case study in the State of Delaware is presented to demonstrate how the proposed approaches can be employed to evaluate the relative importance of the most viable alternative-fuel transit buses according to the predefined set of criteria.

Therefore, in order to avoid the explosion in the rush-repair process, the gas in the tunnel needs to be discharged. Thus, it is necessary to study the leakage law and ventilation scheme of gas in the tunnel. Based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) theory, this paper takes Yanyingshan tunnel of China-Myanmar gas pipeline for instance, Fluent software is used to establish the leakage model of the gas pipeline and fan model in the tunnel. The influence of different factors on the leakage diffusion law and the influence of fan locations and number of fans on gas concentration are analyzed. It can be concluded that: (1) Leakage location, leakage area and pipeline pressure have great influence on the gas leakage and diffusion, leakage hole direction and leakage form have little influence on the gas leakage and diffusion. (2) Set the block valve at both ends of the tunnel can effectively reduce the duration of leakage jet. (3) In order to make ventilation efficient, the fan should be arranged in a higher position and needs to be at a distance from the top of the tunnel. (4) Parallel use of two fans has better ventilation effect than single fan. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Computational fluid dynamics; Gas pipeline; Leakage; Tunnel; Ventilation scheme","Computation theory; Computational fluid dynamics; Diffusion in liquids; Gas pipelines; Gases; Pipelines; Tunnels; Ventilation; Diffusion law; FLUENT software; Gas concentration; Leakage locations; Leakage model; Pipeline leaks; Pipeline pressures; Ventilation effects; Leakage (fluid)","Huang, K.; School of Petroleum Engineering, China; эл. почта: swpuhk@126.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",18755100,,,,"English","J.

The major challenge for the policy makers is to reduce/manage the elevated air pollution level and related acute and chronic health impacts. Air pollution continues to be a nightmare for Delhiites despite implementation of several diversified source interventions. However, the efficacy of these interventions in the reduction of air pollution level did not evaluate before their implementation in the city. The present study has made an attempt towards the quantitative evaluation of selected management strategies in the reduction of air pollution in Delhi city. The results indicate that efficient cleaning of road dust, restricted use of coal based tandoors in hotels/restaurants and together can reduce the PM2.5 concentrations at selected locations up to 25%. The NOx concentration can reduce by restricting the use of diesel generator sets and coal based tandoors in the hotels up to 6%. Results also indicated that individual sources are not sufficient in controlling the increasing air pollution in the city.

In 2014, a typical temperate grassland on the Xilin River of Inner Mongolia was taken as the research site, and soil respiration was measured in the following treatments: addition of water alone (CK), addition of water + N fertilizer [CN, 2.5 g•( m2•a)-1], addition of water + labile C [CG, 24 g•( m2•a)-1], and addition of water + N fertilizer+ labile C [CNG, 2.5 g•( m2•a)-1+24 g•( m2•a) -1], and the correlations of soil respiration with soil temperature, soil moisture, soil dissolved organic C (DOC), and soil microbial biomass C (MBC) were analyzed. During the first water application event (FWE) with the frequency of natural precipitation, cumulative CO2 efflux over 168 hours significantly increased in the CG and CNG treatments, whereas there was no such change in the CN treatment. In addition, soil MBC contents in the CG and CNG treatments were significantly higher than that in the CK and CN treatments, and the correlation of average soil respiration rate with soil MBC content among these treatments was positively significant (P&lt;0.05). In contrast with during the FWE, cumulative CO2 efflux over 168 hours and soil MBC content significantly decreased during the second water application event (SWE) with no natural precipitation (P&lt;0.05), whereas soil DOC content significantly increased (P&lt;0.05). The cumulative CO2 efflux over 168 hours significantly decreases in the CN and CG treatments (P&lt;0.05).During both the water application events, soil respiration rate had a positive relationship with soil temperature and soil volume water content (P&lt;0.05). Therefore, it is proposed that the distribution of natural precipitation influences soil water content, which controls the effects of exogenous C and N on soil respiration in semiarid grassland ecosystems. © 2018, Science Press.

However, currently lacking are practical ways to quantify the sensitivity of species and community composition to these often-confounded climatic forces. Here we conducted long-term (16 yr) nocturnal-warming (+0.6°C) and reduced precipitation (−20% soil moisture) experiments in a Mediterranean shrubland. Climatic niche groups (CNGs) – species ranked or classified by similar temperature or precipitation distributions – informatively described community responses under experimental manipulations. Under warming, CNGs revealed that only those species distributed in cooler regions decreased. Correspondingly, under reduced precipitation, a U-shaped treatment effect observed in the total community was the result of an abrupt decrease in wet-distributed species, followed by a delayed increase in dry-distributed species. Notably, while partially correlated, CNG explanations of community response were stronger for their respective climate parameter, suggesting some species possess specific adaptations to either warming or drought that may lead to independent selection to the two climatic variables. Our findings indicate that when climatic distributions are combined with experiments, the resulting incorporation of local plant evolutionary strategies and their changing dynamics over time leads to predictable and informative shifts in community structure under independent climate change scenarios. © 2017 The Authors.

Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is considered as a moderately salt-sensitive species and thus soil salinity can be a limiting factor for peanut cultivation. To gain insights into peanut plant physiology in response to salt stress and alleviation, we comprehensively characterized leaf relative electrolyte leakage (REC), photosynthesis, leaf transpiration, and metabolism of plants under salt stress and plants that were subjected to salt stress followed by salt alleviation period. As expected, we found that REC levels were higher when plants were subjected to salt stress compared with the untreated plants. However, in contrast to expectations, REC was even higher compared with salt treated plants when plants were transferred from salt stress to standard conditions. To decipher REC variation in response to salt stress, especial during the recovery, metabolite, and transcript variations were analyzed by GC/MS and RNA-seq method, respectively. Ninety two metabolites, among total 391 metabolites identified, varied in response to salt and 42 metabolites responded to recovery specially. Transcriptomics data showed 1,742 in shoots and 3,281 in roots transcript varied in response to salt stress and 372 in shoots and 1,386 transcripts in roots responded specifically to recovery, but not salt stress. Finally, 95 transcripts and 1 metabolite are indicated as candidates involved in REC, photosynthesis, transpiration, and Na+ accumulation variation were revealed by using the principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis. This study provides valuable information on peanut response to salt stress and recovery and may inspire further study to improve salt tolerance in peanut germplasm innovation. ©2018 Cui, Sui, Duan, Liu, Han, Liu, Wan and Li.","Correlation analysis; Metabolomics; Peanut; Recovery; Salt stress; Transcriptomics",,"Wan, S.; Biotechnology Research Center, China; эл. почта: wansb@saas.ac.cn",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",1664462X,,,,"English","Front.

The analysis addressed both fuel cycle and vehicle manufacturing cycle for the following vehicle types: gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), flex fuel vehicles, compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Gasoline ICEVs using current technology have C2G emissions of ∼450 gCO2e/mi (grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per mile), while C2G emissions from HEVs, PHEVs, H2 FCEVs, and BEVs range from 300-350 gCO2e/mi. Future vehicle efficiency gains are expected to reduce emissions to ∼350 gCO2/mi for ICEVs and ∼250 gCO2e/mi for HEVs, PHEVs, FCEVs, and BEVs. Utilizing low-carbon fuel pathways yields GHG reductions more than double those achieved by vehicle efficiency gains alone. Levelized costs of driving (LCDs) are in the range $0.25-$1.00/mi depending on time frame and vehicle-fuel technology. In all cases, vehicle cost represents the major (60-90%) contribution to LCDs. Currently, HEV and PHEV petroleum-fueled vehicles provide the most attractive cost in terms of avoided carbon emissions, although they offer lower potential GHG reductions. The ranges of LCD and cost of avoided carbon are narrower for the future technology pathways, reflecting the expected economic competitiveness of these alternative vehicles and fuels. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Compressed natural gas; Costs; Efficiency; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Natural gas vehicles; Vehicles; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Economic assessments; Economic competitiveness; Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Internal combustion engine vehicles; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Vehicle manufacturing; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; carbon dioxide; fuel; natural gas; petroleum; gasoline; Article; carbon footprint; combustion; cost effectiveness analysis; economic evaluation; greenhouse gas; life cycle; motor vehicle; United States; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; motor vehicle; Gasoline; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Motor Vehicles; United States; Vehicle Emissions","Elgowainy, A.; Argonne National LaboratoryUnited States; эл. почта: aelgowainy@anl.gov",,"American Chemical Society",0013936X,,ESTHA,"29298387","English","Environ.

Given the large revenue service potential of alternative fuel buses within the urban space, they are good candidates for emissions reductions when they are employed as part of a comprehensive urban transit planning process. The determination of the most appropriate alternative fuel bus asset for a given application is not necessarily that straightforward. The typical bus fleet is developed over a broad time horizon with each asset being acquired to meet a certain agency need or to close a perceived gap in the delivery of public transportation service. Therefore, as new assets are considered, it is critical for the fleet manager to consider as many factors of the fleet infrastructure to better ensure the positive impact that the newly acquired asset will have on fleet performance relative to the overall service goals and objectives of the fleet. This study investigates a broad range of alternative fuel bus technologies and the associated factors that will inform the decision-making process. Further, this work utilizes the inventory and understanding of the range of technology factors and leverages the perspective knowledge of industry experts on each of these factors to develop an expert systems decision-making philosophy to aid in the adoption of industry standards, best practices, consistency and sustainability in fleet asset management over time. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","alternative fuel bus; emissions reductions; environmental sustainability; Expert system; transit","alternative fuel; best management practice; decision making; emission control; energy efficiency; knowledge; management practice; numerical model; philosophy; planning process; public transport; sustainability; transport vehicle; urban planning","Li, M.; Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, United States; эл. почта: lmx@udel.edu",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",13504509,,IJSDB,,"English","Int.

Efforts have been made in the definition of new policies to reduce the environmental impacts of this sector. However, an integrated and consistent assessment of the most promising policies is required, using specific European indicators. For that matter, a life-cycle analysis was applied to the road passenger transport, for the European Union with 27 countries (EU27) in 2010, following a basket-of-products methodology and considering three main stages: production, use, and end-of-life of vehicles. Simapro 8 software was used, along with Ecoinvent 3 database and the impact assessment method International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) 2011 Midpoint+. Changes in vehicle production processes, vehicle constitution, and energy sources for vehicle propulsion were analyzed. The policies resulting in a decrease in all impact categories are the use of smaller or lightweight vehicles by positively influencing use, production, and end-of-life of vehicles. The use of more recent vehicles technology or diesel vehicles show substantial reductions in, respectively, five and eight impact categories (out of 15), justifying their adoption in the European fleet. Generally, the most notorious policies compared to the actual transport paradigm, like compressed natural gas (CNG), biofuels, or electric vehicles use, show the greatest reduction in climate change (up to 46%) but also a very significant rise of impacts in the categories that in the conventional basket-of-products already resulted in the worst indicators after normalization. © 2018 by the authors.

Aphids are excellent models for evaluating the importance of selection in faster-X evolution because their peculiar life cycle and unusual inheritance of sex chromosomes should generally lead to equivalent effective population sizes for X and autosomes. Because we lack a high-density genetic map for the pea aphid, whose complete genome has been sequenced, we first assigned its entire genome to the X or autosomes based on ratios of sequencing depth in males (X0) to females (XX). Then, we computed nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions ratios (dN/dS) for the pea aphid gene set and found faster evolution of X-linked genes. Our analyses of substitution rates, together with polymorphism and expression data, showed that relaxed selection is likely to be the greatest contributor to faster-X because a large fraction of X-linked genes are expressed at low rates and thus escape selection. Yet, a minor role for positive selection is also suggested by the difference between substitution rates for X and autosomes for male-biased genes (but not for asexual female-biased genes) and by lower Tajima's D for X-linked compared with autosomal genes with highly male-biased expression patterns. This study highlights the relevance of organisms displaying alternative chromosomal inheritance to the understanding of forces shaping genome evolution. © The Author(s) 2018.

We examined the influence of hillslope topography on ecosystem productivity, structure, and photosynthetic activity across a range of water and energy availability using three independent methods in a forested watershed (Montana, USA): 308 tree cores; light detection and ranging quantification of stem density, basal area, foliar biomass, and total biomass; and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI; 1984–2012). Multiple linear regression analysis across three conifer species revealed significant increases in measured basal area increment growth rates (from 56 to 2,058 mm2/yr) with increasing values of the topographic wetness index and decreases in the climatic water deficit. At the watershed scale, we observed strong gradients in total biomass (e.g., 52 to 75 Mg/ha), which increased from ridgelines to convergent hollows. The most predominant topographic organization of forest biomass occurred along locations of climatically driven water limitations. Similarly, an analysis of growing season EVI indicated enhanced photosynthetic activity and a prolonged growing season in convergent hillslope positions. Collectively, these analyses confirm that within water-limited landscapes, meter-scale differences in topographic position can mediate the effects of the local energy balance and contribute to large differences in local hydrometeorological processes that are a necessary consideration for quantifying spatial patterns of ecosystem productivity. Further, they suggest that local topography and its topology with regional climate may become increasingly important for understanding spatial patterns of ecosystem productivity, mortality, and resilience as regional climates become more arid. ©2018.

However, these receptors require lipid membranes for functioning under physiological conditions, which prevents their utilization in the production of cell-free in vitro chemical sensing systems. Here, we report the development of a cell-free biomimetic sensing platform using virus-like particles (VLPs) with intact ligand-gated Ca2+ channels and genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GECI). We observed that targeting GECI to the plasma membrane was essential for efficient loading GECI in the VLPs. Although the physiological Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+] maintained in the cells was low (∼10 nM), the concentration in the VLPs was high. This prevented the detection of the increase in [Ca2+] caused by binding of the ligand to the receptor. To address this problem, we employed Lyn-R-CEPIA1, which had low affinity for Ca2+, and a membrane targeting sequence. Thus, we succeeded in monitoring the activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNG) on the VLPs by measuring the increase in fluorescence of Lyn-R-CEPIA1. Our VLP-based sensing system can act as a fundamental platform for all kinds of ligand-gated channels. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","biomimetic sensor; Ca2+ indicator; chemical sensor; ligand-gated ion channel; virus-like particle","Biomimetics; Cell membranes; Chemical sensors; Electrochemical sensors; Fluorescence; Ligands; Nucleotides; Physiology; Viruses; Biomimetic sensors; Chemical receptors; Chemical sensing systems; Cyclic nucleotide; Fluorescence signals; Ligand-gated ion channels; Physiological condition; Virus-like particles; Indicators (chemical); calcium; calcium channel; cyclic nucleotide gated channel; ligand gated ion channel; biomimetics; fluorescence; metabolism; procedures; virion; Biomimetics; Calcium; Calcium Channels; Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels; Fluorescence; Ligand-Gated Ion Channels; Virion","Nagai, T.; Department of Biotechnology, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Japan; эл. почта: ng1@sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp",,"American Chemical Society",23793694,,,"29256249","English","ACS Sensors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041217189

Besides, by engaging mainly fossil fuels in the city transport, we are responsible for air pollution in urban areas. On the other hand, passengers transport (private and public, individual and mass) may contribute substantially to reduce the negative impact on the environment by application of alternative fuels and declining of the use of fossil fuels. The main alternative fuels for drive systems in transport are the following: electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels. Synthetic fuels are option as a technology. Some of them are very effective but too expensive technologies. Another way is introduction of flexible transport (from door to door, on demand, etc.) which application enables to decrease the number of cars in urban centers to avoid congestions and the negative impact on the environment. This paper points out that public transport has a special role in the process of decreasing fossil fuel dependence, and the necessity for rapid alternative technology implementation, as well as development of the public transport system itself. Proposed is the introduction of public passenger transport from door to door that offers a comfort comparable to personal cars (specifically for handicapped persons) and helps to lowering congestions on the roads. © 2018, Serbian Academic Center.

Shippers (producers or traders), transport service providers, businesses and private households favour road transport, because of logistic and financial reasons. Delivery and pick-up vehicles are mainly powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). ICE is a major source of ambient air pollution by NOX and PM10 and of global warming (CO2). More recent and well-maintained engines have much lower emissions of NOX and PM10 than older and less well maintained ones, but their CO2-emission has not been reduced as much. With (local) freight transport growing exponentially, these emissions are likely to rise. The aim of the paper is to estimate how a combination of logistic, technical and policy choices may reduce emissions of CO2, NOX and PM10. The authors follow an integrative, interdisciplinary approach, because the past has taught that alignment of decisions by companies and government is inevitable to effectively deal with the root causes of these emissions. The main research question is as follows: What is needed to reduce the key emissions by regional goods delivery? This was addressed by literature analysis and micro simulation. The latter was used to compare the emissions of diesel, CNG and electricity to power trucks and truck-vans combinations in a region to inner-city delivery scenario. CNG is currently the better option in terms of emissions for the whole trip, largely because of the Dutch grey electric power mix. Replacing the city leg of the trip by vans leads to more emissions, more vehicles, higher parking needs and logistic complexity. Full electric trucks and vans cut out the local air pollution, which is beneficial, but not the emissions by power plants. A green(er) electric power mix is necessary to go to zero emission regional goods delivery. © 2018 WIT Press.","CO2-emission; Fuel consumption; Goods delivery; Practical implications; Technology",,,,"WITPress",20563272,,,,"English","Intl.

These alternatives to the conventional petroleum fuels include biofuels, electricity, natural gas and synthetic fuels produced from coal and natural gas. However, it is very important to point out, that inter-fuel competition is determined not only by the development of technologies, but also by such parameters as availability, fuel cost, consumer preferences and government legislations, all of which vary greatly across the globe. In other words, the very same technologies can be capable of radically altering the fuel mix in some countries while having little to none impact in the others. The topic of the inter-fuel competition development in the transportation sector holds much importance for Russia, as the country’s fuels mix is almost totally dominated by the petroleum products. The diversification of energy sources for transport may positively influence energy security and domestic fuels market stability; reduce the strain on ecology, especially in major cities; all the while increasing Russian oil and petroleum products export potential. The article presents results of the research for prospects of the developments in Russian transport sector fuel mix. The research was carried out using the tools of economic and mathematical modeling under various scenario assumptions. The analysis has shown that natural gas and, to a lesser extent, electricity hold the best prospects as petroleum products substitutes in the long-term. Their cumulative share in the total energy consumption of the road transport sector has the potential of reaching as high as 26% by 2040. Yet, the extent of substitution largely depends on the government actions for infrastructure development and tax incentives for alternative vehicle owners. © 2018, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

One of the main arguments for using of alternative motor fuels are ecological reasons. The aim of the paper was to perform environmental and economic analyses of possibilities of the use of alternative drives in the logistics of metallurgical enterprises, to evaluate the most beneficial fuel from this point of view, and to perform an analysis of obstacles of the following development of the alternative fuel, including proposal for their removal. The method of investigation was, first of all, analysis, synthesis and statistical evaluation of information which was obtained by studying of scientific papers, literature and legal documents at different levels of the state, EU and worldwide institutions. To find a reply to the question related to the impact of the fuels to the living environment, the Life Cycle Assessment analysis was used. According to the economic and ecological analysis, the paper evaluated CNG as one of the most beneficial alternative fuels; and the conclusion of the paper includes evaluation of obstacles of the following development of the CNG and a proposal of possibility of their removal. Besides of that, possibilities of expansion of the manufacturing enterprise's production schedule while using the expansion of CNG in the market as suitable fuel were specified in the conclusion.

At the same time, huge amounts of coal, oil, and natural gas are burnt daily to generate electricity and power to run domestic, workplace, and industrial appliances. The excessive and un-managed use of fossil fuels has not only put pressure on already limited resources, but has also resulted as major contributor of environment pollution. The scientific community has been continuously searching for the renewable and alternate sources of fuel on one hand and an amicable solution to manage the waste on the other hand. These two biggest challenges before the world presently, if diagnosed and managed scientifically, can provide solution to each other by providing clean renewable energy from solid and liquid waste materials. Waste-to-energy technologies physically convert waste matter into more useful forms like bioethanol, biobutanol, biogas, biohythane, CNG, and syngas through various processes such as combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, or biological treatments. The processes like anaerobic digestion and fermentation and combinations of various technologies can be used to tackle the rising demand of energy. Utilizing these wastes would not only provide supply of fuels on sustainable basis but would also be helpful in conserving our environment. The selection of appropriate raw material and efficient technology for biofuel production is of immense importance in order to produce high-quality product with reduced environmental impact.

The composition of the NG used and its physic-chemical properties are presented in the article. In order to determine and to optimize the amount of the NG supplied for motor diesel engines, the authors of the article have tested them on the electro-brake testing bench SAK-N670, which has a balanced pendulum and the weighing machine ""Rapido"". At the same time, the toxicity level of the exhaust gases (EG) was determined using an automatic gas analysis system ""ASGA-T"", and the smoke intensity of the exhaust gas was estimated using an optical-electric reflectometer ""Bosch EFAW-68A"". It has been experimentally established that for the NG using in the tested motor vehicles diesel engines, it is necessary to maintain the following ratio of components: gas should be 80%, diesel fuel filling should be 20%. When converting diesel engine 4F 11.0/2.5 installed on trucks and tractors of urban public utilities to NG, and while the simultaneous use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in it at a rate of 20% (EGR is applied to eliminate the increased nitrogen oxides as a result of using NG), the content of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in EG is reduced by 30.0-30.1%, carbon soot is reduced by 82.0-88.7%; carbon dioxide (CO2) is decreased by 31.6-35.6%. When converting a diesel engine 4FC 11.0/12.5 installed on city passenger buses to NG, in the EG a decrease in NOx content by 5.5-35.1% occurs; carbon soot decreases by 88.2-92.0%; carbon monoxide (CO) decreases by up to 21.6%. The conversion of these motor diesel engines to work on NG, in addition to improving the environmental performance of their EG indicators, also helps to save oil motor fuel in the amount of 80%. © 2018 Publishing House ""O- Kratkoe"".

Natural gas use, particularly for electricity generation, has increased in recent years due to enhanced resource availability from non-traditional reserves and pressure to reduce greenhouse gasses (GHG) from higher-emitting sources, including coal generation. While lower than coal emissions, current natural gas power generation strategies primarily utilize combustion with higher emissions of GHG and criteria pollutants than other low-carbon generation options, including renewable resources. Furthermore, emissions from life cycle stages of natural gas production and distribution can have additional detrimental GHG and air quality (AQ) impacts. On the other hand, natural gas power generation can play an important role in supporting renewable resource integration by (1) providing essential load balancing services, and (2) supporting the use of gaseous renewable fuels through the existing infrastructure of the natural gas system. Additionally, advanced technologies and strategies including fuel cells and combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) systems can facilitate natural gas generation with low emissions and high efficiencies. Thus, the role of natural gas generation in the context of GHG mitigation and AQ improvement is complex and multi-faceted, requiring consideration of more than simple quantification of total or net emissions. If appropriately constructed and managed, natural gas generation could support and advance sustainable and renewable energy. In this paper, a review of the literature regarding emissions from natural gas with a focus on power generation is conducted and discussed in the context of GHG and AQ impacts. In addition, a pathway forward is proposed for natural gas generation and infrastructure to maximize environmental benefits and support renewable resources in the attainment of emission reductions. © 2018 The Authors","Air quality; Co-benefits; Fuel cells; Greenhouse gas; Methane; Natural gas","Air quality; Carbon; Climate change; Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Cooling systems; Emission control; Fuel cells; Gas generators; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Natural gas well production; Pollution; Proven reserves; Co benefits; Combined cooling heating and power; Electricity generation; Environmental benefits; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Natural gas power generations; Natural-gas production; Resource availability; Gas emissions","Brouwer, J.; Advanced Power and Energy Program, United States; эл. почта: jbrouwer@uci.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03601285,,PECSD,,"English","Prog.

SMEs are the engine drivers of economic growth, one of which is manufacturing. The challenge is that government from various countries in developing and underdeveloped countries, mandated agencies in their respective areas, to ensure that there is economic progress for these SMEs, but productivity remains low in the manufacturing SMEs. When SMEs do not perform well, productivity of manufacturing SMEs declines and unemployment increases. Thus, an increase in unemployment results in a drop of GDP in the country and can become a global and economic crisis.

We consider the following options for a 40-foot and a 60-foot transit bus: a conventional bus powered by either diesel or a biodiesel blend (B20 or B100), a diesel hybrid-electric bus, a sparking-ignition bus powered by Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), and a battery electric bus (BEB) (rapid or slow charging). We estimate life cycle ownership costs (for buses and infrastructure) and environmental externalities caused by greenhouse gases (GHGs) and criteria air pollutants (CAPs) emitted from the life cycle of bus operations. We find that all alternative fuel options lead to higher life cycle ownership and external costs than conventional diesel. When external funding is available to pay for 80% of vehicle purchase expenditures (which is usually the case for U.S. transit agencies), BEBs yield large reductions (17–23%) in terms of ownership and external costs compared to diesel. Furthermore, BEBs’ advantages are robust to changes in operation and economic assumptions when external funding is available. BEBs are able to reduce CAP emissions significantly in Pittsburgh's hotspot areas, where existing bus fleets contribute to 1% of particulate matter emissions from mobile sources. We recognize that there are still practical barriers for BEBs, e.g. range limits, land to build the charging infrastructure, and coordination with utilities.

The study exhibits that capital Himalayan cities experienced rapid growth (830.92%) with high population increase (333.45%) during the observation period (1972–2015). The significant urban growth was observed in the cities of western and middle Himalayan region viz., Srinagar (9.36 km2–142.19 km2), Kathmandu (11.38 km2–92.58 km2) and Dehradun (4.1 km2–50.09 km2) in the higher altitudes due to remarkable increase in the population (0.5–1 million persons) during 1972–2015. On the contrary, Itanagar (7.19 km2), Gangtok (7.09 km2), Shimla (3.04 km2) and Thimphu (2.93 km2) observed less urban growth with moderate to low population growth (i.e., 0.05 to 0.15 million persons). The Shannon entropy based study exhibits that the cities viz., Kathmandu, Gangtok and Itanagar observed comparatively more dispersed urban growth during later period (1991–2015) as compared to the previous period (1972–1991) whereas, the remaining cities observed comparatively less dispersed urban growth during later period. The temporal land consumption pattern exhibits low density urban growth in Srinagar, Dehradun and Kathmandu, as observed with decrease in population density and increasing land consumption during 1972–2015 as compared to other cities, wherein urban densification was evident with increase in population density and decrease in land consumption. The cities in central and western Himalayan region observed high urban growth as compared to cities in eastern Himalayan region. The result shows that the capital cities contributes insignificant proportion (0.5%; 314 km2) of urban area in Himalayan region and accommodating large (ca. 4 million) population during 2015. The study indicates unplanned and haphazard growth in all capital Himalayan cities, leading towards urban densification as well as dispersion in the periphery with varied pattern and intensity. The specific trends and patterns of urban and population growth are governed by geographical as well as socio-economic-political factors at local to regional scale. The high population pressure induced higher risk to the urban residents as well as constrained urban growth over higher vulnerable zones. The study necessitates implementation of suitable urban planning methods considering socio-economic and physico-cultural characteristics of the region. © 2017","Geoinformatics; Himalayan cities; Shannon Entropy; Urban growth","GIS; land use; population density; socioeconomic conditions; urban area; urban growth; urban population; urban sprawl; Arunachal Pradesh; Bagmati; Bhutan; Dehradun; Gangtok; Himachal Pradesh; India; Itanagar; Jammu and Kashmir; Kathmandu; Nepal; Shimla; Sikkim; Srinagar [Jammu and Kashmir]; Thimphu; Uttarakhand","Kumar, A.; Centre for Land Resource Management, India; эл. почта: amit.iirs@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",01436228,,,,"English","Appl.

The aim of this study was to explore the diversity of flower-foraging insects involved in pollen transfer in mountain semi-natural grasslands. Insects actively collecting pollen and/or nectar were caught in spring in six mountain semi-natural grasslands displaying a floristic richness gradient. Individual determinations of insects were made at the finest possible taxonomic scale and pollen loads were removed from the insect body. Using next-generation DNA sequencing, pollens were identified through the ribosomal DNA cistron using the ITS2 database and the ITS plant rDNA cistron sequences from Genbank. A total of 236 flower-foraging insects were collected. Diptera represented 82% of the total catches distantly followed by Hymenoptera (15%) and Apoidea (bees) (11%). Visual observations revealed that Diptera foraged on 16 of the 21 flower species visited by insects. DNA metabarcoding showed that 82% (191) of all of the collected insects were carrying pollen and 44% (104) were carrying two genera of plants or more. Our results demonstrate that Diptera are potential key-pollinators in mountain semi-natural grasslands that cannot be overlooked by the scientific community. However difficulties of taxonomic determination due to severe shortage of experts for Diptera have to be urgently overcome. Further studies on the link between pollen transfer and actual pollination in a global change context are also required. Moreover, our results support the idea that DNA metabarcoding provides accurate information about the plants-insects networks but it also pointed out sensitive issues, especially the necessity to build reliable national barcode databases. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","DNA barcoding; Flower-foraging insects; Plant-pollinator interactions; Pollen loads; Semi-natural grasslands","DNA; flower; foraging behavior; grassland; insect; mountain environment; plant-pollinator interaction; pollen; pollination; Apoidea; Diptera; Hexapoda; Hymenoptera","Galliot, J.-N.; EPGV US 1279, France; эл. почта: jean-noel.galliot@inra.fr",,"Springer International Publishing",1366638X,,,,"English","J.

Methods and Results: An open photobioreactor was inoculated with an indigenous microalgae sample from the Texcoco Soda Lake. A microalgae community was adapted to fix CO2 from synthetic biogas through different culture conditions reaching a maximum of 220 mg CO2 l−1 per day. Picochlorum sp. and Scenedesmus sp. were identified as the prominent microalgae genera by molecular fingerprinting (partial sequencing of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes) but only the first was detected by microscopy screening. Changes in the microalgae community profile were monitored by a range-weighted richness index, reaching the lowest value when biogas was upgraded. Conclusions: A robust microalgae community in the open photobioreactor was obtained after different culture conditions. The specialization of microalgae community for CO2 fixation under H2S presence was driven by biogas upgrading conditions. Significance and Impact of the Study: The alkaline conditions enhance the CO2 absorption from biogas and could optimize specialized microalgae communities in the open photobioreactor.

However, understanding the sources and transport of Nr species has been a challenge due to limited observations of atmospheric deposition of the key Nr species across India. In this study, wet deposition of atmospheric inorganic Nr species was investigated during the year 2013 at two regionally representative sites: Delhi (an urban site) and Jaunpur (a rural site). These sites are located in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region, which is one of the most populated and fertile regions of India. The average NH4+ concentrations in rain water were found to be 25.4 μeql−1 and 98.5 μeql−1 at the rural and urban sites, respectively, whereas average NO3− concentrations were 12.4 μeql−1 and 28.7 μeql−1 at the rural and urban sites (respectively). The annual average wet deposition fluxes of NH4+ and NO3− at Delhi were calculated as 10.45 and 3.05 kgN ha−1 yr−1 respectively, whereas at Jaunpur the fluxes were 3.19 and 1.56 kgN ha−1 yr−1 respectively. In order to assess the Nr deposition, our estimates showed 486% increase in NO3− (from 0.52 to 3.05 kgN ha−1 yr−1) while 283% NH4+ (2.72–10.44 kgN ha−1 yr−1) between 1994 and 2013 at Delhi, clearly indicating the effect of urbanization and Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change.

In particular, we addedland cover variables into the clustering to reflect not only simple climate but also social factorsinfluencing biological habitats. In total, 53 bioclimatic variables were constructed, and principalcomponents were generated using correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA).The iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm (ISODATA) was used to cluster theprincipal components and land cover variable. The constructed bioclimatic zones were assignedcodes and descriptive names based on aridity, seasonality, and naturality, and their environmentalcharacteristics were identified.

The basic premise for engine adaptation was the addition of a small amount of CNG to reduce exhaust gas opacity and particulate matter emission. At this assumption, diesel oil remained the basic fuel, with contribution amounting to 0,70-0,85 of total energy delivered to the engine. The dual fuel engine was examined using an original controller installed in the Diesel engine FPT 1.3 MJT which controlled the diesel fuel dose. The dose of the injected natural gas was controlled by changing the opening time of gas injectors at constant pressure in the gas collector. The examined issues included the exhaust gas opacity, and the total number and fractional distribution of the emitted particles. The measurements were performed at twenty selected measuring points corresponding to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test. The performed tests have demonstrated a positive effect of gas addition on exhaust gas opacity and particulate matter emission. Depending on test conditions, the exhaust gas opacity was reduced by 10÷92%, and the total number of particles by 30÷40%. The performed tests have revealed that a small addition of gas can reduce the load of the DPF filter, extend its lifetime, and increase engine reliability. Longer time intervals between successive DPF filter regenerations improve ecological properties of the engine.","Diesel engine; dual fuel engine; emission; natural gas; opacity; particulate matter","Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Engines; Exhaust gases; Fuel filters; Fuels; Gases; Natural gas; Neutron emission; Opacity; Particulate emissions; Dual fuel diesel engine; Ecological property; Engine reliability; Filter regeneration; Fractional distribution; New european driving cycles; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter emissions; Dual fuel engines","Stelmasiak, Z.; University of Bielsko-Biała, Willowa 2, Poland; эл. почта: zstelmasiak@ath.bielsko.pl",,"De Gruyter Open Ltd",12332585,,,,"English","Pol.

Even greater resilience is achievable through the mining of resistance alleles from compatible wild sunflower relatives, including numerous extremophile species. Here we report a high-quality reference for the sunflower genome (3.6 gigabases), together with extensive transcriptomic data from vegetative and floral organs. The genome mostly consists of highly similar, related sequences and required single-molecule real-time sequencing technologies for successful assembly. Genome analyses enabled the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the Asterids, further establishing the existence of a whole-genome triplication at the base of the Asterids II clade and a sunflower-specific whole-genome duplication around 29 million years ago. An integrative approach combining quantitative genetics, expression and diversity data permitted development of comprehensive gene networks for two major breeding traits, flowering time and oil metabolism, and revealed new candidate genes in these networks. We found that the genomic architecture of flowering time has been shaped by the most recent whole-genome duplication, which suggests that ancient paralogues can remain in the same regulatory networks for dozens of millions of years. This genome represents a cornerstone for future research programs aiming to exploit genetic diversity to improve biotic and abiotic stress resistance and oil production, while also considering agricultural constraints and human nutritional needs. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Yet little rigorous work has been developed that quantitatively assesses the effects of transit access or egress by automobiles. This research evaluates the life-cycle impacts of first-and-last mile trips on multimodal transit. An environmental life-cycle assessment of transit and automobile travel in the greater Los Angeles region is developed to evaluate the impacts of multimodal transit trips by utilizing existing transportation life-cycle assessment methods. First-last mile automobile trips with transit may increase multimodal trip emissions significantly, mitigating potential impact reductions from transit usage. In some cases, multimodal transit trips with first-last mile automobile use may have higher emissions than competing automobile trips. In the near-term, first-last mile automobile trips in some Los Angeles transit services may account for up to 66% of multimodal greenhouse gas emissions, and as much as 75% of multimodal air quality impacts. Fossil fuel energy generation and combustion, low vehicle occupancies, and longer trip distances contribute most to increased multimodal impacts. Supply chain analysis indicates that life-cycle air quality impacts may occur largely locally (in Los Angeles) or largely remotely depending on the propulsion method and location of upstream life-cycle processes. Reducing 10% of transit system greenhouse emissions requires a shift of 23–50% of automobile first-last mile trips to a neutral emissions mode. © 2017","Air quality; First-last mile; Greenhouse gas; Life-cycle assessment; Multimodal; Transit","Air pollution; Air quality; Crashworthiness; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Mass transportation; Quality control; Supply chains; Transit time devices; Environmental life cycle assessment; Greenhouse emissions; Last mile; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multi-modal; Public transportation; Supply chain analysis; Transit; Automobiles; air quality; automobile; emission inventory; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; public transport; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States","Hoehne, C.G.эл. почта: chris.hoehne@asu.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",13619209,,TRDTF,,"English","Transp.

Considering this, real-time temporal variation in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations were measured in various types of rural household kitchens. Observed average concentrations of PM2.5, CO, percent relative humidity (%RH) and temperature (T) in five different kitchen types were 549.6 μg/m3, 4.2 ppm, 70.2% and 20 °C respectively. Highest CO and PM2.5 concentration were found in household performing cooking in indoor kitchens (CO: 9.3 ppm; PM2.5: 696.5 μg/m3) followed by outdoor kitchens (CO: 5.8 ppm; PM2.5: 539.5 μg/m3). The concentration of PM2.5 and CO varied according to the fuel type and highest concentration was observed in kitchens using cowdung cakes followed by agricultural residue &gt; firewood &gt; biogas &gt; Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). Results revealed that the pollutants concentration varied with kitchen type, fuel type and the location of kitchen. An exposure index was developed to calculate the exposure of cook, non-cook and children below 5 years. Analysis of exposure index values shows that cooks, who use solid biomass fuel (SBF) in indoor kitchen, are four times more exposed to the harmful pollutants than the cooks using clean fuel. Further, using indoor PM2.5 concentrations, hazard quotient was calculated based on evaluation of intake concentration and toxicological risk, which also shows that SBF users have higher health risks (hazard quotient &gt; 1) than the clean fuel (LPG) users. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Children; Exposure index; Hazard quotient; Rural kitchen; Solid biomass fuel; Time-activity pattern","Agricultural wastes; Air pollution; Biohazards; Biomass; Carbon monoxide; Developing countries; Fuels; Health risks; Liquefied petroleum gas; Particles (particulate matter); Biomass fuels; Children; Exposure index; Hazard quotients; Time activity patterns; Kitchens; carbon monoxide; fuel; carbon monoxide; air exposure; air quality; atmospheric pollution; child health; concentration (composition); developing world; hazard assessment; health risk; household survey; indoor air; rural area; air analysis; air pollutant; air quality; Article; biomass; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cooking; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; health hazard; household; human; human impact (environment); humidity; indoor air pollution; kitchen; particulate matter; risk assessment; vulnerable population; analysis; cooking; environmental monitoring; indoor air pollution; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Carbon Monoxide; Cooking; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter","Ravindra, K.; School of Public Health, India",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"28209408","English","Sci.

Institute affiliated with the Max Planck Society, Ludwig-Erhard-Allee 2, Bonn, 53175, Germany","Sperm are ubiquitous and yet unique. Genes involved in sexual reproduction are more divergent than most genes expressed in non-reproductive tissues. It has been argued that sperm have been altered during evolution more than any somatic cell. Profound variations are found at the level of morphology, motility, search strategy for the egg, and the underlying signalling mechanisms. Sperm evolutionary adaptation may have arisen from sperm competition (sperm from rival males compete within the female’s body to fertilize eggs), cryptic female choice (the female’s ability to choose among different stored sperm), social cues tuning sperm quality or from the site of fertilization (internal vs. external fertilization), to name a few. Unquestionably, sperm represent an invaluable source for the exploration of biological diversity at the level of signalling, motility, and evolution. Despite the richness in sperm variations, only a few model systems for signalling and motility have been studied in detail. Using fast kinetic techniques, electrophysiological recordings, and optogenetics, the molecular players and the sequence of signalling events of sperm from a few marine invertebrates, mammals, and fish are being elucidated. Furthermore, recent technological advances allow studying sperm motility with unprecedented precision; these studies provide new insights into flagellar motility and navigation in three dimensions (3D). The scope of this review is to highlight variations in motile sperm across species, and discuss the great promise that 3D imaging techniques offer into unravelling sperm mysteries. © 2017, The Author(s).","Chemotaxis; Flagellar beat; Klinotaxis; Sperm morphology; Steering","animal; bacterial phenomena and functions; biodiversity; chemotaxis; evolution; fertilization; flagellum; gene expression; genetic polymorphism; male; marine biology; physiology; reproduction; signal transduction; spermatozoon motility; spermatozoon tail; three dimensional imaging; ultrastructure; Animals; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Chemotaxis; Fertilization; Flagella; Gene Expression; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Marine Biology; Polymorphism, Genetic; Reproduction; Signal Transduction; Sperm Motility; Sperm Tail","Alvarez, L.; Center of Advanced European Studies and Research (caesar).

The proposed methodological procedure was applied to the past and present situation in Spain, taking the city of Madrid as a characteristic example. The boundaries of the system include both the fuel life cycle (FLC) and the vehicle life cycle (VLC), the emissions for which are calculated using the GlobalTRANS tool developed at the Technical University of Madrid (UPM). In the city of Madrid, MSW transport vehicles run solely on compressed natural gas (CNG). The fleet's carbon footprint (CF) is 25.1 kg CO2 eq/tMSWcollected, 92% of which stems from the FLC and the remaining 8% from the VLC. In terms of the FLC, 86% of the impact comes from the Tank-to-Wheel (TtW) stage and 14% from the Well-to-Tank (WtT) stage. The raw material extraction, manufacturing and transport processes account for 67% of total VLC greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The situation in the city of Madrid in 2013 is compared to that in other Spanish cities and to past scenarios in Madrid, when vehicles ran on diesel. The DIESEL scenario yields emissions that are 18.5% higher than those of the CNG scenario, which means the CF would rise to 29.7 kg CO2 eq/tMSW. A possible future scenario where CNG is replaced by purified biogas from the anaerobic digestion of municipal waste (BIOGAS scenario) was also evaluated. In this case, CF is 92% lower. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; GHG emissions; Life cycle assessment; Waste collection vehicles","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Compressed natural gas; Crashworthiness; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Natural gas vehicles; Raw materials; Solid wastes; Tanks (containers); Vehicles; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); GHG emission; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Raw material extraction; Technical universities; Transport process; Transport vehicles; Waste collection; Carbon footprint; carbon footprint; climate change; diesel; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; traffic emission; transport process; Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Spain]; Spain","Pérez, J.; Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, C/ José Gutiérrez Abascal, 2, Spain; эл. почта: javier.perez@etsii.upm.es",,"Elsevier Ltd",13619209,,TRDTF,,"English","Transp.

Electromethanogenesis provides a novel approach to waste treatment, carbon dioxide fixation and renewable energy storage into a chemically stable compound, such as methane. This has become an important area of research since it was first described, attracting different research groups worldwide. Basics of the process such as microorganisms involved and main reactions are now much better understood, and recent advances in BES configuration and electrode materials in lab-scale enhance the interest in this technology. However, there are still some gaps that need to be filled to move towards its application. Side reactions or scaling-up issues are clearly among the main challenges that need to be overcome to its further development. This review summarizes the recent advances made in the field of electromethanogenesis to address the main future challenges and opportunities of this novel process. In addition, the present fundamental knowledge is critically reviewed and some insights are provided to identify potential niche applications and help researchers to overcome current technological boundaries. © 2017 by the authors.","BES technology; Biocathode; Bioelectrochemistry; Methane; Methanogenesis; Microbial electrolysis cell; Power-to-gas","biogas; methane; methane; applied research; biocatalyst; biofuel production; carbon dioxide fixation; chemical oxygen demand; electric current; electrochemistry; electrode; electrolysis; electron transport; electroporation; gas diffusion; greenhouse effect; inoculation; methanogen; microbial community; nonhuman; physical chemistry; renewable energy; Review; scale up; technology; waste management; bioenergy; biosynthesis; biotechnology; microbiology; procedures; research; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Biotechnology; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Electrolysis; Industrial Microbiology; Methane; Renewable Energy; Research; Waste Management","Puig, S.; Laboratory of Chemical and Environmental Engineering (LEQUIA), Campus Montilivi, Carrer Maria Aurèlia Capmany, 69, Spain; эл. почта: sebastia@lequia.udg.cat",,"MDPI AG",16616596,,,"28425974","English","Int.

Increased salinization of arable land is expected to have devastating global effects and would lead to 30% land loss within the next 25 years and up to 50% by the middle of the twenty-first century. Plants growing in saline conditions generally last to three distinct stresses, ionic, osmotic, and oxidative. The toxic effects of specific ions such as Na+ and Cl-, prevalent in saline soils, disrupt the structure of enzymes and other macromolecules, damage cell organelles, disrupt general metabolic activities, inhibit protein synthesis, and induce ion deficiency. Plants exposed to low water potential face the problem of physiological drought condition. Moreover, salinity creates nutrient imbalance in the plant due to decreased and differential uptake of nutrients and/or their translocation to the shoot and leaf tissues, rendering the plants weak and unproductive. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous soil microorganisms that build up symbiotic associations with the majority of higher plants, establish a direct physical link between soil and plant roots, constitute an integral component of the natural ecosystems, and predominantly exist in the saline environment. The extraradical hyphae of AMF run several meters away from the depletion zone, increase root surface area and facilitate nutrient absorption by the plant. Indeed, AMF improve physiological processes and general metabolic activities of the plant and help in the mitigation of physiological drought, which is often imposed under saline conditions. Therefore, the application of AMF could offer a cheaper and cost-effective alternative to counteract the problem of salinity. In this review chapter, we have discussed the factors influencing soil salinization and possible approaches to overcome the problem of salinity stress. The underlying physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which mycorrhizal plants could improve salt tolerance has also been described. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Mycorrhizal fungi; Reactive oxygen species; Salinity tolerance; Soil salinization",,"Saxena, B.; Department of Botany, India; эл. почта: bhoopg@yahoo.com",,"Springer Singapore",,9789811041150; 9789811041143,,,"English","Arbuscular Mycorrhizas and Stress Toler. of Plants",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033357520

At the molecular level, toothed whales have high percentages of pseudogenic olfactory receptor genes, but species that have been investigated to date retain an intact copy of the olfactory marker protein gene (OMP), which is highly expressed in olfactory receptor neurons and may regulate the temporal resolution of olfactory responses. One hypothesis for the retention of intact OMP in diverse odontocete lineages is that this gene is pleiotropic with additional functions that are unrelated to olfaction. Recent expression studies provide some support for this hypothesis. Here, we report OMP sequences for representatives of all extant cetacean families and provide the first molecular evidence for inactivation of this gene in vertebrates. Specifically, OMP exhibits independent inactivating mutations in six different odontocete lineages: four river dolphin genera (Platanista, Lipotes, Pontoporia, Inia), sperm whale (Physeter), and harbor porpoise (Phocoena). These results suggest that the only essential role of OMP that is maintained by natural selection is in olfaction, although a non-olfactory role for OMP cannot be ruled out for lineages that retain an intact copy of this gene. Available genome sequences from cetaceans and close outgroups provide evidence of inactivating mutations in two additional genes (CNGA2, CNGA4), which imply further pseudogenization events in the olfactory cascade of odontocetes. Selection analyses demonstrate that evolutionary constraints on all three genes (OMP, CNGA2, CNGA4) have been greatly reduced in Odontoceti, but retain a signature of purifying selection on the stem Cetacea branch and in Mysticeti (baleen whales). This pattern is compatible with the ‘echolocation-priority’ hypothesis for the evolution of OMP, which posits that negative selection was maintained in the common ancestor of Cetacea and was not relaxed significantly until the evolution of echolocation in Odontoceti. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Anosmia; Cetacea; Echolocation; Odontoceti; Olfaction; Olfactory marker protein","mitochondrial DNA; olfactory marker protein; animal; classification; evolution; genetics; molecular evolution; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; physiology; toothed whale; Animals; Base Sequence; Biological Evolution; DNA, Mitochondrial; Dolphins; Evolution, Molecular; Olfactory Marker Protein; Phylogeny","Springer, M.S.; Department of Biology, United States; эл. почта: mark.springer@ucr.edu",,"Academic Press Inc.",10557903,,MPEVE,"28193458","English","Mol.

In this study, compressed natural gas (CNG), mixed with various produced water samples and the hydrate formation reactions were performed at the pressure of about 95 bar and temperature of 274.2 K. After hydrate formation, the concentrated salty water was extracted from the reactor and the formed hydrate was washed with a suitable amount of fresh water to successfully improve desalination efficiency. Then, the hydrate was dissociated to produce fresh water. Desalination efficiencies for dissolved mineral extraction from produced water samples were measured and it has been found that with 3-stages hydrate process, 79.5%-–84.3% of dissolved mineral components will be removed using gas hydrate formation.

The observations on CH4 are the basis for quantitative analysis of urban carbon emissions. Taken into consideration the weekly and daily changing characteristics of urban traffic, we conducted experiments to analyze the features of traffic CH4emission and its influential factors. The experiments were conducted on 3 main roads in Nanjing on Oct. 17, 18, 20, 23, 2014 with 5 periods of observation per day, and in Nanjing Yangtze River tunnel in the morning and at night of Sep.11 2014. The results showed that: (1)The average concentration of CH4 on the urban main road of Nanjing city was greater than that of the background atmosphere. Affected by traffic conditions, the spatial difference of ΔCH4 concentration was significant on three typical main roads. ΔCH4 concentration's diurnal variation showed inverted “W” type, and its peak appeared in the morning and evening rush hours. (2) Due to the “piston wind” in the tunnel, the CH4 concentration in Nanjing Yangtze River tunnel gradually increased from the inlet to the outlet and the difference of concentration between the inlet and the outlet was 0.21×10-6-0.38×10-6. (3)There was a good linear correlation between CH4 concentration and CO2 concentration. The atmospheric ΔCH4∶ΔCO2 value of urban main road in Nanjing was 0.009 1 and the atmospheric ΔCH4∶ΔCO2 value of Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel was 0.000 47-0.001 4. (4)Traffic volume and the proportion of natural gas vehicles were the main factors influencing atmospheric ΔCH4 concentration and ΔCH4∶ΔCO2. © 2017, Science Press.

Lastly, it considers the future of such groups, asking whether they will become more prominent as more people become ecologically aware and as global environmental conditions deteriorate, or whether such groups have peaked as a force for environmental change. © Gerry Nagtzaam 2017.

Life cycle results for electric trucks vary strongly with weighted positive kinetic energy, whereas those for non-electric trucks vary the most with average trip speed. Our parametric life cycle assessment models explain 91%–98% of the variability in life cycle inventory and impact assessment results, revealing “how” and “why” the trade-offs of truck electrification change with different input conditions. In terms of cost, whether total cost of ownership or also including health and climate impact costs, model year 2015 battery electric trucks in severe applications such as urban driving provide positive and robust net benefits in many areas of the U.S. However, for typical operations, petroleum diesel with idle reduction or hybrid-electric technology provide the largest overall life cycle cost benefit. Battery electric, idle reduction, and hybrid trucks emit lower life cycle greenhouse gas emissions across the board in comparison with the other technologies. Despite lower carbon-intensity, electric trucks tend to be water-intensive because of cooling water consumption for thermo-electric power plants. Hybrid trucks create higher NOx emissions and thus larger associated environmental impacts. Idle reduction is beneficial to urban-type applications. Compressed natural gas trucks are the least water-intensive but may not reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Using marginal rather than average factors for electric grid emissions calculations doesn't change the overall life cycle comparisons. Improving driving behavior has universally positive effects for which the exact magnitude and sensitivity depend on environmental impact indicators and technologies. © 2016","Electric vehicles; Life cycle trade-offs; Marginal electric grid; Parametric analysis; Robustness; Water-energy nexus","Automobiles; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon; Climate models; Commerce; Compressed natural gas; Cooling water; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric batteries; Electric power plants; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Natural gas; Robustness (control systems); Secondary batteries; Trucks; Electric grids; Environmental life cycle assessment; Hybrid electric technology; Life cycle assessment model; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Parametric -analysis; Trade off; Water energy; Life cycle","Lee, D.-Y.; Energy Systems Division, 9700 South Cass Avenue, United States; эл. почта: dongyeon.lee@anl.gov",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

To this end, this study uses a hybrid life-cycle assessment method to analyze and compare alternative fuel-powered Class 8 HDTs. To account for the uncertainty in the data a Monte Carlo simulation is also applied. The HDTs considered in this analysis (biodiesel (B20), compressed natural gas (CNG), hybrid, and BE HDTs) are compared to the diesel HDT (conventional HDT). The results show that BE HDTs outperform all other types of trucks overall, despite their incremental costs and electricity generation-related emissions. Furthermore, if such a BE truck were to run on electricity generated in the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) NERC region, fuel-consumption related GHGs emissions from BE HDTs could decrease by as much as 63 percent. It has also been found that, although there is a slight difference between the life-cycle costs (LCCs) of conventional HDTs and CNG-powered HDTs, the latter emits 33% more GHGs than the former. Moreover, this study concludes that CNG trucks yield no improvements in either HDT's life-cycle environmental impacts or LCCs compared to their conventional counterparts. Providing that electricity is generated from renewable energy sources, the use of BE trucks would significantly improve the life-cycle performance of a truck as well as ambient air quality. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution externalities; Alternative fuel technology; Battery-electric trucks; Heavy-duty trucks; Life-cycle assessment; Regional electricity generation analysis","Air quality; Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Battery electric vehicles; Compressed natural gas; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric power generation; Environmental impact; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Renewable energy resources; Trucks; Alternative fuel technologies; Electric truck; Electricity generation; Heavy duty trucks; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle","Tatari, O.; Department of Civil, United States; эл. почта: tatari@ucf.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Government policies are expected, at the country level, to be designed and implemented in support of this commitment. This paper reports on reductions in CO2 emissions achieved by an ongoing federal program in Mexico focused on artisanal or small-scale fisheries (SSFs). Launched in 2008, this technological change-focused program substitutes old two-stroke outboard motors with fourstroke ones, which offer more efficient gasoline consumption and also reduce CO2 emissions. The program's annual emissions reduction target is 0.2% of the total annual national target of 83.2 million tonnes in CO2 emissions reductions, according to the 2014–2018 Special Climate Change Program in Mexico (known by its Spanish acronym, PECC). Based on primary-source information gathered from SSFs through fieldwork at the national level for the period 2008–2015, the reductions achieved in gasoline consumption produce a cumulative reduction in CO2 emissions of 1.274 million tonnes (37%) from 20,733 substituted motors (46% of total SSFs). Based on several assumptions, a simulation forecasted a 100% substitution by the year 2024 with cumulative CO2 emissions savings of 5.234 million tonnes.

Some metals (e.g., lead) are toxic at very low levels, whereas others (e.g., manganese) are essential to living systems at low concentrations, but may be toxic at higher concentrations. Metals may exist in several valence states that differ in toxicity and may be associated with organic matter and inorganic materials that can affect their toxicity. The presence of metals in the environment has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Their accumulation in the environment is of concern because of their persistence.

In this original and important book, Gullette presents evidence of pervasive age-related assaults in contemporary societies and their chronic affects. The sudden onset of age-related shaming can occur anywhere-the shove in the street, the cold shoulder at the party, the deaf ear at the meeting, the shut-out by the personnel office or the obtuseness of a government. Turning intimate suffering into public grievances, Ending Ageism, Or How Not to Shoot Old People effectively and beautifully argues that overcoming ageism is the next imperative social movement of our time. © 2017 by Margaret Morganroth Gullette.

However, crop growth and productivity is severely affected in saline soil. Many strategies were proposed to overcome the salt detrimental effects like development of salt-tolerant cultivars through breeding and/or genetic engineering, removal of excessive salt accumulation in soil, desalinization of irrigation water etc. Though these strategies are efficient but costly. Hence, a cost-effective new alternative attempt has taken up to mitigate soil salinity which involves inoculation of salt-tolerant arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in agricultural crop. Mechanisms of amelioration of salt stress in AMF-plant symbiosis involve enhancing the uptake of less mobile phosphorus, increasing nutrient acquisition, maintaining osmotic balance, enhancing antioxidants and polyamines, altering hormonal status, reducing ion toxicity and enhancing photosynthetic efficiency. AMF colonization induces an increase in root hydraulic conductivity of the host plants under osmotic stress conditions. Furthermore, AMF symbiosis also alters expression of cation channels and transporters, late embryogenesis abundant protein and aquaporins. AMF symbiosis not only changes plant physiology but also changes nutritional and physical properties of the rhizosphere. In the mycorrhizosphere, AMF interact with natural and introduced microorganisms and affect soil properties and quality. The quality of soil largely depends on its physical and chemical properties as well as diversity and activity of soil biota. Thus, AMF have been considered as bio-ameliorators of saline soils. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","AMF; Aquaporin’s; Compatible solutes; Nutrient uptake; Soil salinity","Amines; Cost effectiveness; Cost engineering; Crops; Cultivation; Fungi; Genetic engineering; Irrigation; Nutrients; Osmosis; Salt removal; Aquaporins; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Compatible solutes; Late embryogenesis abundant proteins; Nutrient uptake; Physical and chemical properties; Root hydraulic conductivity; Soil salinity; Soils","Yadav, R.S.; ICAR-Directorate of Groundnut Research, Ivnagar Road, India; эл. почта: yadavrs2002@gmail.com",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319482576; 9783319482569,,,"English","Bioremediation of Salt Affected Soils: An Indian Perspective",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034245043

Owing to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, it is also a valuable component for low-input cropping systems. To evaluate the genetic diversity and the scale of linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay in pea, we genotyped a collection of 917 accessions, gathering elite cultivars, landraces, and wild relatives using an array of ~13,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Genetic diversity is broadly distributed across three groups corresponding to wild/landraces peas, winter types, and spring types. At a finer subdivision level, genetic groups relate to local breeding programs and type usage. LD decreases steeply as genetic distance increases. When considering subsets of the data, LD values can be higher, even if the steep decay remains. We looked for genomic regions exhibiting high level of differentiation between wild/landraces, winter, and spring pea, respectively. Two regions on linkage groups 5 and 6 containing 33 SNPs exhibit stronger differentiation between winter and spring peas than would be expected under neutrality. Interestingly, QTL for resistance to cold acclimation and frost resistance have been identified previously in the same regions. © 2017 Siol et al.","FST; Genetic diversity; Linkage disequilibrium; Pisum sativum","breeding; cultivar; freezing tolerance; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene mutation; gene structure; genetic distance; genetic variability; germplasm; human; landrace; nonhuman; pea; single nucleotide polymorphism; spring; wild type; winter; Bayes theorem; ecotype; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetics; pea; plant genome; plant seed; season; Bayes Theorem; Ecotype; Gene Frequency; Genome, Plant; Linkage Disequilibrium; Peas; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Seasons; Seeds","Siol, M.; UMR 1347 Agroécologie INRA, 17 rue Sully, BP 86510, France; эл. почта: mathieu.siol@inra.fr",,"Genetics Society of America",21601836,,,"28611254","English","G3 Genes Genome Genet.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027262928

Exploring the temporal and spatial variation of the water balance is crucial for efficient vegetation restoration at the micro-landform scale. The SWMS-2D model was used to estimate the seasonal variations of the water balance including evapotranspiration, soil water storage changes, lateral flow and drainage, and to examine the effects of micro-landforms (i.e., the top, upper, down, and bottom positions of the dune slope, and the interdune lowland area) on these components from May to October 2013 and 2015. Results showed that the soil water content was sensitive to rainfall pulses, particularly large precipitation events. Over 70% of the total evapotranspiration occurred from June to August, with a maximum daily value of 6.56 mm. At a monthly scale, evapotranspiration was not synchronous with precipitation. The ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation was 1.84, 0.39, 2.49, 0.93, 2.26, and 1.14 in May, June, July, August, September, and October 2013 (a wet year), respectively; and 2.40, 1.11, 0.69, 2.14, 1.07, and 1.11 in 2015 (a dry year), respectively. The components of the water balance were significantly different among different micro-landforms. Evapotranspiration of a lowland area was greater than that in other micro-landforms, and the value in the wet year (2013) was significantly greater than that in the dry year (2015). However, water consumption in the lowland area was similar in both years. At the top, upper, down, and bottom positions of the dune slope, the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation in the wet year (2013) was 96%, 97%, 86%, and 96%, respectively; while in the dry year (2015), the ratio was 103%, 103%, 88%, and 104%. Therefore, in the dry year, evapotranspiration was generally larger than precipitation, indicating that almost all water from precipitation was evaporated. The lateral flow of the root zone from top to bottom accounted for only a small portion of water budget at the growing season scale. The results could be generalized to other similar region with corresponding model calibration, and would help to reveal seasonal variations of water balance components under the local topography, climate, soil, and vegetation conditions. © 2017 by the author.","Dune-interdune landscape; Soil-water movement; SWMS-2D model; Water balance components","drainage; dune; evapotranspiration; growing season; precipitation (climatology); quantitative analysis; rhizosphere; seasonal variation; soil water; spatiotemporal analysis; two-dimensional modeling; water budget; water content; water flow; water storage; China; Horqin Desert","Wang, A.; Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, China; эл. почта: waz@iae.ac.cn",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021136007

Engine had originally a port fuel injection and exhaust gas recirculation system. Experiments showed that engine fuelled with hydrogen addition was able to achieve lower fuel consumption and brake specific fuel consumption. It was also possible to achieve small increase of engine efficiency. The exhaust gas measurements showed that hydrogen addition in natural gas reduced the CO, CO2 and HC emissions because of the H/C atom ratio change in fuel mixture and improved combustion process.

The influence of air temperature and vehicle load on this process is considered. The theory of constructive analogy as an example of natural gas vehicles is taken into account. The vehicles mentioned above were comparatively analyzed according to their level of adaptability to low ambient temperatures in the context of fuel consumption and exhaust gases emissions. The regularities of the influence of low ambient temperatures and cargo weight on fuel consumption and the harmful substances emitted with the exhaust gases of natural gas vehicles were determined. In the range of negative air temperatures, the consumption of diesel fuel increased in comparison with a consumption of natural gas to 9%, and at positive temperatures, the consumption of gas increased up to 3%. Decreasing air temperature and cargo weight reduced the mass emissions of soot and the nitrogen oxide emitted with exhaust gases during operation, both on the diesel and gas-diesel cycles. Soot emissions decreased to 26% and nitrogen oxide to 54%. The specific emissions of harmful substances emitted with exhaust gases per unit of fuel consumed for vehicles when operating on the gas-diesel cycle (GDC) is 14.33% less than on diesel. When the ambient temperature falls to -38°C, the vehicle adaptability by fuel consumption when operating on the GDC increases on 6.18% in comparison with a diesel cycle. The vehicles' adaptability, assessed by harmful substances emitted with exhaust gases, to changes in cargo weight are almost identical. © 2017 WIT Press.","Adaptability; Fuel consumption; Harmful substances emissions; Natural gas vehicles variable low ambient temperature conditions","Atmospheric temperature; Automobiles; Diesel fuels; Dual fuel engines; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Exhaust gases; Fuel consumption; Fuel economy; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gases; Natural gas; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Temperature; Vehicles; Adaptability; Air temperature; Analogy method; Comparative assessment; Harmful substances; Low ambient temperatures; Mass emissions; Soot emissions; Natural gas vehicles; adaptive management; air temperature; ambient air; assessment method; economic analysis; environmental impact assessment; exhaust emission; fuel consumption; natural gas; numerical method; soot; traffic emission",,,"WITPress",17437601,,,,"English","Int.

Increasing evidence suggests that transmembrane water channels (aquaporins) evolved to play vital adaptive roles that mitigate the osmotic and oxidative stress problems of the developing oocytes, embryos and spermatozoa. In this chapter, we provide a short overview of the diversity of the aquaporin superfamily in teleosts, and summarize the findings that uncovered a highly specific molecular regulation of aquaporins during oogenesis and spermatogenesis. We further review the multiple functions that these channels play during the establishment of egg buoyancy and the activation and detoxification of spermatozoa in the marine environment. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2017.","Aquaporin; Egg; Hydration; Mitochondria; Motility; Oocyte; Oxidative stress; Sperm","aquaporin; aquaporin 1; aquaporin 10a; aquaporin 10b; aquaporin 12; aquaporin 14; aquaporin 15; aquaporin 1aa; aquaporin 1ab; aquaporin 2; aquaporin 3; aquaporin 3a; aquaporin 3b; aquaporin 4; aquaporin 4a; aquaporin 4b; aquaporin 5; aquaporin 7; aquaporin 8; aquaporin 8aa; aquaporin 8ab; aquaporin 8bb; aquaporin 9; aquaporin 9a; aquaporin 9b; unclassified drug; aquaporin; fish protein; isoprotein; animal cell; benthos; cell activation; cell energy; detoxification; flagellum; gamete; germ cell; marine environment; nonhuman; organelle biogenesis; pelagic species; protein function; protein localization; protein processing; species diversity; spermatozoon; spermatozoon motility; teleost; adaptation; animal; aquatic species; classification; Cypriniformes; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; male; metabolism; oocyte; osmotic pressure; oxidative stress; Perciformes; phylogeny; salinity; transport at the cellular level; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Aquaporins; Aquatic Organisms; Biological Transport; Cypriniformes; Female; Fish Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Male; Oocytes; Osmotic Pressure; Oxidative Stress; Perciformes; Phylogeny; Protein Isoforms; Salinity; Spermatozoa","Cerdà, J.; Institut de Recerca i Tecnologia Agroalimentàries (IRTA), Passeig maritim 37-49, Spain; эл. почта: joan.cerda@irta.cat",,"Springer New York LLC",00652598,,AEMBA,"28258572","English","Adv.

However, the integration of indigenous knowledge and local people into mainstream natural resources management is still restricted due to epistemological and institutional obstacles. This research explores the differences in perceptions of the nature of water resources, and their consequent management, existing between local people and the government in the Gam River Basin of Vietnam, concentrating on the views of the majority Tay and Dao peoples. We focus on how knowledge differences can be communicated and how water management can integrate different ways of knowing. We identify barriers to, and opportunities for, the involvement of indigenous knowledge and local people in water resources management at the research site. We argue that local needs and aspirations in relation to the use and management of water resources do indeed have a role in the modern world, contrary to the views of many scientists and government officers. Therefore, indigenous knowledge needs to be considered in water resources management schemes, to achieve the effective and sustainable use of water in areas such as the Gam River Basin.","Ethnic people; Gam River Basin; Indigenous knowledge; Traditional ecological knowledge; Vietnam; Water management","ethnic group; indigenous knowledge; local participation; perception; river basin; sustainability; traditional knowledge; water management; water resource; Viet Nam",,,"Water Alternatives Association",19650175,,,,"English","Water Altern.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012907029

There are several indicator issues to address each aspect of sustainability and it is not easy for decision makers to understand the result due to the use of multiple indicators. In this regard, the paper aims at the identification and combination of indicators allowing to assess the sustainability which is applicable to a carbon fiber recycling sector. Indicators selection were carried out by performing an extensive literature review on existing publications dealing with the different pillars of sustainability and setting a number of selection criteria to prioritize indicators that are relevant to the sector. For the environmental aspect global warming, acidification and human toxicity seem to be the most relevant. The social-economic aspect can be addressed through considering the resource impact assessment by considering the supply risk due to the geological scarcity of a resource and the potential supply disruption due to geopolitical and other social factors. The finding shows that three indicators have been identified enabling the assessment of the environmental pillar. Then the necessity to use extra resources indicators was shown and justified by the need of providing a shorter timeframe perspective as well as to consider the amount of fiber to be recycled in the future and also to determine the potential benefit provided by the creation of this sector to the resource strategy point of view. This will be made possible by using such method as the criticality assessment that enable the consideration of geological and geopolitical supply risk as well as the characterization of the system dependence to a specific resource. Finally, these results lead to the expression of the need to the development of a novel indicator assessing the criticality of carbon fibers as well as the expression of the necessity for further research on the socio-economic perspectives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon fiber; Criticality assessment; Key Sustainability Performance Indicators; Recycling; Sustainability assessment","Benchmarking; Carbon fibers; Criticality (nuclear fission); Decision making; Fibers; Geology; Global warming; Recycling; Risk assessment; Social aspects; Criticality assessment; Environmental aspects; Impact assessments; Literature reviews; Multiple indicators; Potential benefits; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability performance; Sustainable development; assessment method; carbon fiber; decision making; environmental impact assessment; environmental risk; global warming; literature review; recycling; resource assessment; socioeconomic indicator; sustainability; toxicity","Sonnemann, G.; CyVi, UMR 5255, France; эл. почта: guido.sonnemann@u-bordeaux.fr",,"Elsevier B.V.",1470160X,,,,"English","Ecol.

Trip-level GHG emissions are first estimated by combining different data sources such as origin–destination (OD) surveys, vehicle fleet fuel consumption rates, and transit ridership data. BE indicators for the different urban regions are generated for each household and the impact of neighborhood typologies is derived based on these indicators. A traditional ordinary least square (OLS) regression approach is then used to investigate the direct association between the BE indicators, socio-demographics, and household GHGs. The effect of neighborhood typologies on GHGs is explored using both OLS and a simultaneous equation modeling approach. Once the best models are determined for each urban region, the potential impact of BE is determined through elasticities and compared with the impact of technological improvements. For this, various fuel efficiency scenarios are formulated and the reductions on household GHGs are determined. Once the potential impact of green transit and car technologies is determined, the results are compared to those related to BE initiatives. Among other results, it is found that BE attributes have a statistically significant effect on GHGs. However, the elasticities are very small, as reported in several previous studies. For instance, a 10 % increase in population density will result in 3.5, 1.5 and 1.4 % reduction in Montreal, Quebec and Sherbrooke, respectively. It is also important to highlight the significant variation of household GHGs among neighborhoods in the same city, variation which is much greater than among cities. In the short term, improvements on the private passenger vehicle fleet are expected to be much more significant than BE and green transit technologies. However, the combined effect of BE strategies and private-motor vehicle technological improvement would result in more significant GHGs reductions in the long term. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Built environment characteristics; Emerging vehicle technologies; Greenhouse gas emissions; Neighborhood typologies; Travel behavior","Crashworthiness; Elasticity; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Population statistics; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Built environment; Fuel consumption rates; Neighborhood typologies; Ordinary least squares; Simultaneous equation modeling; Technological improvements; Travel behaviors; Vehicle technology; Greenhouse gases; emission inventory; environmental factor; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; innovation; least squares method; traffic emission; travel behavior; urban area; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Quebec [Quebec (PRV)]","Miranda-Moreno, L.; Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics, Canada; эл. почта: luis.miranda-moreno@mcgill.ca",,"Springer New York LLC",00494488,,,,"English","Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934783955

The already available INRA 717-1B4 nuclear genomic resource (v1.1 of sPta717 at http://aspendb.uga.edu/index.php/databases/spta-717-genome) presents only INRA 717-1B4 genomic regions with high similarity to the P. Trichocarpa genomic reference sequences. We assembled draft genomic scaffolds by a combination of de novo assembly with reference-based assembly using 30x resequencing NGS data (Illumina MiSeq? and Ion Torrent Ion PGM?) of INRA 717-1B4. In total, 419,969 scaffolds of length larger than 500 bp were generated. The mean length of the scaffolds is 2,166 bp and the size of the largest scaffold 84,573 bp. The N50 contig length is 3,850 bp when considering contigs larger than 1,000 bp. Probably due to the high level of heterozygosity of this interspecific hybrid, the accumulated scaffold length is with 0.9 GB about twice the expected size of the haploid nuclear genome.

The core collection was established by using simple sequence repeats (SSR) data and the M strategy, which aims at maximizing the allelic diversity. A 48-core collection was defined which captured 99.5% of the SSR alleles used to establish it, and 96.9% of the SSR alleles which belonged to an independent set of markers. The defined core collection was further validated by analysing 35 agro-morphological traits. The class coverage value and the estimates of the Shannon-Weaver diversity index indicated a good representation of the phenotypic diversity in the core collection. Furthermore, the core set included accessions having the most desirable status for several agronomic traits. A linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis, using data obtained with the SolCAP SNP array on the defined core collection, was performed. The population structure analysis showed that the core collection did not present a clear genetic structure. The linkage disequilibrium analysis carried out between markers located on the same pseudomolecule within 10,000 bp concluded that 41.3% of these pairs of SNP markers have a significant LD.

Using pharmacological analysis we showed the existence of two opposite responses of nematodes cholinergic system to moderate and extreme heat stress. Short-term (15 min) noxious heat (31–32 °C) caused activation of cholinergic synaptic transmission in C. elegans and C. briggsae organisms by sensitization of nicotinic ACh receptors. In contrast, hyperthermia blocked cholinergic synaptic transmission by inhibition of ACh secretion by neurons. The resistance of behavior to extreme high temperature (36–37 °C) was significantly higher in C. briggsae than in C. elegans, and thermostability of cholinergic transmission correlated with resistance of behavior to hyperthermia. Activation of cholinergic transmission by moderate heat stress can be the reason of movement speed increase in such adaptive behavior as noxious heat escape. Inhibition of ACh release is one of reasons for behavior failure caused by extreme high temperature since partial inhibition of ACh-esterase by aldicarb protected C. elegans and C. briggsae behavior against hyperthermia. Antagonist of mAChRs atropine almost completely prevented the rise in behavior thermotolerance caused by aldicarb. Pilocarpine, agonist of mAChRs, protected nematodes behavior against hyperthermia similarly with aldicarb.

More than half the world's population lives in urban areas, with the U.S. percentage at 80 percent. Cities have captured more than 80 percent of the globe's economic activity and offered social mobility and economic prosperity to millions by clustering creative, innovative, and educated individuals and organizations. Clustering populations, however, can compound both positive and negative conditions, with many modern urban areas experiencing growing inequality, debility, and environmental degradation. The spread and continued growth of urban areas presents a number of concerns for a sustainable future, particularly if cities cannot adequately address the rise of poverty, hunger, resource consumption, and biodiversity loss in their borders. Intended as a comparative illustration of the types of urban sustainability pathways and subsequent lessons learned existing in urban areas, this study examines specific examples that cut across geographies and scales and that feature a range of urban sustainability challenges and opportunities for collaborative learning across metropolitan regions. It focuses on nine cities across the United States and Canada (Los Angeles, CA, New York City, NY, Philadelphia, PA, Pittsburgh, PA, Grand Rapids, MI, Flint, MI, Cedar Rapids, IA, Chattanooga, TN, and Vancouver, Canada), chosen to represent a variety of metropolitan regions, with consideration given to city size, proximity to coastal and other waterways, susceptibility to hazards, primary industry, and several other factors. © 2016 by the National Academy of Sciences.

However, lack of molecular sequence information and tools have slowed the adoption of these physiological systems as molecular model systems. In this study, we sequenced and performed de novo assembly for the nervous system transcriptomes of two decapod crustaceans: the Jonah crab (Cancer borealis) and the American lobster (Homarus americanus). Results: Forty-two thousand, seven hundred sixty-six and sixty thousand, two hundred seventy-three contigs were assembled from C. borealis and H. americanus respectively, representing 9,489 and 11,061 unique coding sequences. From these transcripts, genes associated with neural function were identified and manually curated to produce a characterization of multiple gene families important for nervous system function. This included genes for 34 distinct ion channel types, 17 biogenic amine and 5 GABA receptors, 28 major transmitter receptor subtypes including glutamate and acetylcholine receptors, and 6 gap junction proteins - the Innexins. Conclusion: With this resource, crustacean model systems are better poised for incorporation of modern genomic and molecular biology technologies to further enhance the interrogation of fundamentals of nervous system function. © 2016 The Author(s).","Crustacean; Ion channel; Neurotransmitters; Stomatogastric; Transcriptome","4 aminobutyric acid receptor; biogenic amine; cholinergic receptor; gap junction protein; glutamate receptor; innexin; ion channel; transcriptome; unclassified drug; agents interacting with transmitter, hormone or drug receptors; ion channel; transcriptome; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; Cancer borealis; central nervous system function; contig mapping; controlled study; Decapoda (Crustacea); genetic association; genetic code; genetic trait; Homarus americanus; multigene family; nerve cell network; nervous tissue; neuromodulation; nonhuman; RNA sequence; RNA transcription; animal; biology; cluster analysis; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; genetic association study; genetics; high throughput sequencing; molecular genetics; nervous system function; procedures; Animals; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Decapoda (Crustacea); Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Genetic Association Studies; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Ion Channels; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Nervous System Physiological Phenomena; Neurotransmitter Agents; Transcriptome","Schulz, D.J.; University of Missouri-Columbia, United States; эл. почта: schulzd@missouri.edu",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712164,,BGMEE,"27809760","English","BMC Genomics",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994246082

Despite this role, auto-rickshaws and their drivers face considerable criticism from the public, the media and policy makers. There is a contentious public debate about the perceived faults of auto-rickshaws and their drivers, and the policies to address these issues in Indian cities. Our objective is to provide balance and nuance to this debate, and to enable the perspective of drivers to be more effectively considered, along with that of auto-rickshaw users and the wider travelling public, in policy-making. To this end, we critically discuss the criticism and underlying perceptions; highlight the niche role of auto-rickshaws in urban transport; and present an investigation of the realities and economics of auto-rickshaw ownership and operation. The actual congestion, safety and air pollution impacts of auto-rickshaws are at strong variance with the criticisms and perceptions on the part of the public, media and policy makers. The realities of auto-rickshaw operation are extremely challenging, and unlikely to place the driver and his family above the poverty line, which may drive some of the actions, such as not going by the meter. Finally, we critically assess policy recommendations to address the issues related to auto-rickshaws and their drivers, and offer our own suggestions regarding open permit systems, improved access to formal sector credit, a timetable for regular fare revision and the phasing out of auto-rickshaws with two-stroke engines. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Auto-rickshaw; Economics of operation; India; Transport policy; Urban transport","perception; transportation economics; transportation policy; urban transport; India","Badami, M.G.; School of Urban Planning and McGill School of Environment, Macdonald-Harrington Building, 815 Sherbrooke Street West, Canada; эл. почта: madhav.badami@mcgill.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",0967070X,,,,"English","Transp.

Supplementation with 20% BGS gave a maximum yield of 1155 gkg-1 fruit bodies, furnishing an increase of 95.1% over WS control. Significant increase (p ≤ 0.05) in protein content (29.6-38.9%), sugars (29.1-32.3%) and minerals (N, P, K, Fe, Zn) was observed in the fruit bodies. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed to see the pattern of correlation within a set of observed variables and how these different variables varied in different treatments. PC1 and PC2 represented 90% of total variation in the observed variables. Moisture (%), lignin (%), celluloses (%), and C/N ratio were closely correlated in comparison to Fe, N, and saponins. PCA of amino acids revealed that, PC1 and PC2 represented 74% of total variation in the data set. HPLC confirmed the absence of any saponin residues (characteristic toxins of mahua cake) in fruit bodies and mushroom spent. FTIR studies showed significant degradation of celluloses (22.2-32.4%), hemicelluloses (14.1-23.1%) and lignin (27.4-39.23%) in the spent, along with an increase in nutrition content.

In plants, studies aimed at elucidating the extent of SV are still in their infancy. Evidence has indicated a high presence and an active role of SV in driving plant genome evolution in different plant species. With the aim of characterizing the size and the composition of the poplar pan-genome, we performed a genome-wide analysis of structural variation in three intercrossable poplar species: Populus nigra, Populus deltoides, and Populus trichocarpa. We detected a total of 7,889 deletions and 10,586 insertions relative to the P. trichocarpa reference genome, covering respectively 33.2 Mb and 62.9 Mb of genomic sequence, and 3,230 genes affected by copy number variation (CNV). The majority of the detected variants are inter-specific in agreement with a recent origin following separation of species. Insertions and deletions (INDELs) were preferentially located in low-gene density regions of the poplar genome and were, for the majority, associated with the activity of transposable elements. Genes affected by SV showed lower-than-average expression levels and higher levels of dN/dS, suggesting that they are subject to relaxed selective pressure or correspond to pseudogenes. Functional annotation of genes affected by INDELs showed over-representation of categories associated with transposable elements activity, while genes affected by genic CNVs showed enrichment in categories related to resistance to stress and pathogens. This study provides a genome-wide catalogue of SV and the first insight on functional and structural properties of the poplar pan-genome. © 2016 The Author 2016.

The adoption of alternative fuel trucks may mitigate the environmental impacts, however, the first cost of these trucks is higher than those of traditional diesel trucks. To this end, based on environmental, social, and economic indicators, a model that provides optimized solutions for a fleet consists of 30 commercial delivery trucks is studied in this paper. An economic input–output based hybrid life cycle assessment is performed in conjunction with Multi-Objective Linear Programming to evaluate various delivery truck fleet combinations and to provide a comprehensive analysis of fleet performance. Furthermore, six specific scenarios, representing different utilization levels and fuel economy levels, have been taken into consideration to reflect the sensitivity of fleet performance with respect to real word operation. The performances of the vehicles are evaluated based on three criteria: economic aspects, environmental concerns, and public health impacts. Furthermore, the results are considered from two perspectives, the first being a case in which no constraints are taken into account, and the second case being considered under tailpipe emission constraints. The results indicate that when fuel economy is high and annual mileage is low, current diesel trucks are able to fulfill the requirement in both cases with reasonably low costs. Conversely, in scenarios with low fuel economy and high utilization levels, hybrid vehicles are preferred. However, the optimization model selects more electric trucks when tailpipe emission constraints are accounted. © 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Conventional air pollution externalities; Economic input–output based hybrid LCA; Electric delivery truck; Multi-Objective Linear Programming",,"Tatari, O.; Department of Civil, United States; эл. почта: tatari@ucf.edu",,"Elsevier",23525509,,,,"English","Sustain.

It is estimated that by 2030 there will be 41 megacities and most of them will be located in developing countries. The megacities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata) collectively have &gt;46 million inhabitants. Increasing population and prosperity results in rapid growth of the already large consumption of energy and other resources, which contributes to air pollution, among other problems. Megacity pollution outflow plumes contain high levels of criteria pollutants (e.g. Particulate matter, SO2, NOx), greenhouse gases, ozone precursors and aerosols; which can affect the atmosphere not only on a local scale but also on regional and global scales. In the current study, emissions and concentration trends of criteria and other air pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and greenhouse gases) were examined in the three Indian megacities. Further, various policies and control strategies adopted by Indian Government are also discussed to improve air quality. Decreasing trends of SO2 was observed in all three megacities due to decrease in the sulfur content in coal and diesel. However, increasing trend for NOx was found in these megacities due to increase in number of vehicles registered and high flash point of CNG engines, which leads to higher NOx emission. In terms of SPM and PM10, highest emissions have been found at Kolkata, whereas highest ambient concentrations were recorded in Delhi. For Mumbai and Kolkata fluctuating trends of SPM concentrations were observed between 1991 and 1998 and stable afterwards till 2005; whereas for Delhi, fluctuating trend was observed for the entire study period.

Populus is considered as a promising 2G feedstock and understanding the genetic basis of biomass yield and feedstock quality are a research priority in this model tree species. Results: We report the first coppiced biomass study for 714 members of a wide population of European black poplar (Populus nigra L.), a native European tree, selected from 20 river populations ranging in latitude and longitude between 40.5 and 52.1°N and 1.0 and 16.4°E, respectively. When grown at a single site in southern UK, significant Site of Origin (SO) effects were seen for 14 of the 15 directly measured or derived traits including biomass yield, leaf area and stomatal index. There was significant correlation (p &lt; 0.001) between biomass yield traits over 3 years of harvest which identified leaf size and cell production as strong predictors of biomass yield. A 12 K Illumina genotyping array (constructed from 10,331 SNPs in 14 QTL regions and 4648 genes) highlighted significant population genetic structure with pairwise FST showing strong differentiation (p &lt; 0.001) between the Spanish and Italian subpopulations. Robust associations reaching genome-wide significance are reported for main stem height and cell number per leaf; two traits tightly linked to biomass yield. These genotyping and phenotypic data were also used to show the presence of significant isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by adaption (IBA) within this population. Conclusions: The three associations identified reaching genome-wide significance at p &lt; 0.05 include a transcription factor; a putative stress response gene and a gene of unknown function. None of them have been previously linked to bioenergy yield; were shown to be differentially expressed in a panel of three selected genotypes from the collection and represent exciting, novel candidates for further study in a bioenergy tree native to Europe and Euro-Asia. A further 26 markers (22 genes) were found to reach putative significance and are also of interest for biomass yield, leaf area, epidermal cell expansion and stomatal patterning. This research on European P. nigra provides an important foundation for the development of commercial native trees for bioenergy and for advanced, molecular breeding in these species. © 2016 The Author(s).","Genetics; Leaf area; Lignocellulosic; Salicaceae; Short rotation coppice (SRC); Yield","Chromosomes; Feedstocks; Forestry; Genes; Plants (botany); Population statistics; Transcription; Genetics; Leaf area; Lignocellulosic; Salicaceae; Short rotation coppice; Yield; Biomass; bioenergy; biomass; coppice; genetics; leaf area; yield; Populus; Populus nigra; Salicaceae","Taylor, G.; Centre for Biological Sciences, United Kingdom; эл. почта: G.Taylor@soton.ac.uk",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17546834,,,,"English","Biotechnol.

Based on comparing the world practices of restrictive measures on greenhouse gas emissions with Russian legislation, we conclude that there is a need to adjust the limits of CO2 emission taking into account the negative impact of ambient temperature on CO2 emission. The climatic conditions of many countries stipulate the use of vehicles in temperatures below zero. At the same time, the existing regulations fully take into account the temperature features of the various countries, which casts doubt on the existence of uniform emission standards for all countries. Here, we conduct an experiment on one of the most popular cars in Russia: the Mitsubishi Lancer 9. We establish that lower temperatures are correlated with larger concentrations of CO2 in the exhaust gases. We draw a conclusion about the need to account for the actual operating conditions when establishing limit values on CO2 emissions of vehicles. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Crashworthiness; Gas emissions; Gases; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Innovation; Laws and legislation; Temperature; Vehicles; Climatic conditions; Gasoline vehicle; Limit values; Lower temperatures; Mitsubishi; Operating condition; Uniform emission; Exhaust gases",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Data are available from seven air quality monitoring stations (AMS) and meteorological parameters were measured at three meteorological observatories (MO). The daily mean concentrations of NOx and CO across NCR of Delhi (average of all seven AMSs) were 37.1 ± 11.6 ppb (NO: 18.3 and NO2: 18.8 ppb), and 2.3 ± 0.6 ppm, respectively. The highest diurnal CO concentrations were observed during midnight (21:00 to 01:00 h LT) due to nocturnal boundary conditions. The daily mean O3 concentration was 37.5 ± 11.0 ppb. The diurnal variations of O3 concentrations were characterized by the high concentrations during the daytime (07:00 to 17:00 h LT: 43.6 ppb) and low concentrations during the late evening and early morning hours (18:00 to 06:00 h LT: 31.1 ppb). From 07:00 h onwards, the O3 concentrations start increasing gradually after sunrise coinciding with the increasing solar radiation. The highest concentrations (51.7 ppb) were observed around 15:00 h. Thereafter, it is decreased. Local sources of gaseous pollutants were identified by analyzing the surface wind patterns. The annual resultant wind vector were 338° (57%) and 288° (27%) at the Hindon and Palam MOs, respectively. Local NO emissions substantially reduced the urban ozone concentrations as seen by the observed untitrated NO concentrations. © 2016 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air quality monitoring stations; Carbon monoxide; Oxides of nitrogen; Ozone; Resultant wind vector",,"Tyagi, S.; Department of Environmental Science, India; эл. почта: styagi6@gmail.com",,"Elsevier",13091042,,,,"English","Atmos.

The impacts have been studied for the passenger and goods vehicles separately. For this purpose three alternative scenarios for the passenger vehicles and two alternative scenarios for the goods vehicles have been analysed for the year 2021. The interventions include stringent source emission norms, modal shift resulting from introduction of effective public transport alternatives, speed regulation measures and hiking of parking fee of private vehicles. These scenarios have been compared to the base year 2007. An important finding that emerged from the study is that stringent fuel emission norms and introduction of alternative public transport systems alone may not result in the modal shift and hence reduction in exhaust emissions. It is actually a combination of these measures and management measures such as increased parking fee and regulated uniform speed of public transport that results in desired benefits. Further, the inclusion of goods vehicle demand during transport policy formulation can help in controlling air pollution in new urban centres in India and in major developing regions of the world. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution inventory; Integrated mass rapid transit system; Megacity Delhi; Passenger vehicles; Road transport emissions",,"Jain, S.; Department of Natural Resources, 10, Institutional Area, Vasant Kunj, India; эл. почта: sureshjain_in@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",22141405,,,,"English","J.

The atmospheric warming potential of CH4 is 28–36 times, when averaged over a 100-year period, that of carbon dioxide (CO2) and this necessitates a close scrutiny of global CH4 emissions inventory. As the second most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG), the annual global CH4 emissions were 645 million metric tons (MMT), accounting for 14.3% of the global anthropogenic GHG emissions. Of this, five key anthropogenic sources: agriculture, coal, landfills, oil and gas operations and wastewater together emitted 68% of all CH4 emissions. Landfills are ranked as the third highest anthropogenic CH4 emission source, behind agriculture and coal mines, and emissions from the waste sector are expected to reach almost 800 million metric tons CO2 equivalent (MMTCO2e) in 2015. The two largest economies spewed out 42% (14% (US) and 28% (China)) of the world's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; these two countries are also the largest producers of municipal solid waste (MSW). The United States averages 250 MMT of MSW annually, of which about 63% enters landfills. In 2015, there were 2434 landfills in the United States and CH4 from these landfills accounted for 138 MMTCO2e released into the atmosphere and represents 17.7% of all US CH4 emissions. China had 580 landfills and treated 105 MMT of MSW in 2013. Methane produced from landfills contributes about 13% of total CH4 emissions in China. Almost 50% of landfills in China did not install efficient LFG collection and utilization systems to make them manageable so a great deal of CH4 and CO2 are emitted without intervention. Recent data show that globally, 45 billion cubic meters (bcm) of CH4 or 282 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) was annually released from landfills into the atmosphere. Managing methane emission from landfills is a global challenge, though China lags behind in managed landfills that contribute to adverse health effects on the population. Moreover, the rich organic content of MSW in China indicates that CH4 emissions there may be underestimated. The China unmanaged landfill scenario is further duplicated in developing as well as in least-developed countries. This review starts with a dialog on CH4 emissions and climate change and the chemical changes the CH4 molecule undergoes in the atmosphere (Section 1). Section 2 deals with identification of global CH4 emissions from key sources, particularly anthropogenic, among those are agriculture, coal mines, landfills, oil and gas operations and wastewater. Although each of these sources is descriptive on their own, the focus of Section 3 is on landfills with particular emphasis on the United States and China, two largest producers of waste. The quantitative measurement of CH4 emissions is still uncertain so Section 4 is devoted to various CH4 estimation models, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) LandGEM, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others that are under development. The key landfill emissions data bases and the collection methodologies such as those used in the United States and recently released by the Chinese government are highlighted. Section 5 describes chemistry of pathways that produce CH4 from landfills, and how landfills can control those emissions. Section 6 reviews potential of CH4 as an energy source for combined heat and power (CHP) production as well as pathways for conversion of CH4 into renewable gaseous fuel for use as compressed natural gas (CNG) and clean liquids that could be used as either drop-in replacement (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel hydrocarbons) or advanced oxygenated fuels such as methanol, a versatile precursor to fuels and chemicals, and dimethylether (DME), a clean diesel substitute. Section 7 describes in-place government policies to deal with CH4 emissions from specific sectors. These policies vary from country to country but the Unites States and the European Union (EU) countries are well ahead in curbing methane emissions while China is now playing close attention to its increasing global share of emissions. The last section (Section 8) identifies science and technology and needed policy challenges to manage fugitive methane; this includes identification of technological intervention that China and other countries would need to capitalize on this wasted resource by efficiently harvesting this energy source, needed government policies and science and technology issues that researchers have to deal with to help combat climate change. The overall review provides a comprehensive description that could lead a coherent picture to harvest global CH4 emissions for useful energy, a sensible solution. In 2014, a milestone was reached in US and China relations when the White House announced that the United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26%–28% below its 2005 level in 2025 while China intends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and intends to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. In another 2014 initiative, the United States also identified fugitive methane from oil and gas operations, agriculture, and landfills to maintain respective post-2020 actions on climate change, recognizing that these actions are part of the longer term efforts to transition to low-carbon economies, mindful of containing the global temperature increase goal of 2 °C, also known as two-degree scenario (2DS). These commitments by the United States and China were evident in the successful agreement at the culmination of the recently concluded COP21 event in Paris. This review is written to start a dialog among researchers that tetrahedral CH4, the simplest among all organic compounds, plays such a complex role in climate change that as its use increases, it will rival carbon dioxide (CO2) in GHG effect in the coming decades if no attempt is made to contain its emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Electricity; Energy policy; Energy production; Landfills; Methane","Agriculture; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Coal; Coal mines; Compressed natural gas; Electricity; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental Protection Agency; Fighter aircraft; Fuel economy; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gases; Global warming; Heating; Land fill; Methane; Methanol fuels; Molecules; Municipal solid waste; Natural gas well production; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Combined heat and power production; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Energy productions; Least-developed countries; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Primary energy consumption; United nations intergovernmental panel on climate changes; United states environmental protection agencies; Greenhouse gases","Mahajan, D.; Advanced Energy Research and Technology Center (AERTC), Stony Brook, United States; эл. почта: devinder.mahajan@stonybrook.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03601285,,PECSD,,"English","Prog.

A four-cylinder, four-stroke gasoline engine was used to investigate the engine combustion emissions and thermal balance characteristics using 2-butanol-gasoline blended fuels at 50% throttle wide open. In this experimental study, the gasoline engine was tested at 2-butanol-gasoline percentage volume ratios of 5:95 (GBu5), 10:90 (GBu10) and 15:85 (GBu15) of gasoline to butanol, respectively. Combustion analysis results showed that 2-butanol-gasoline blends have a lower in-cylinder pressure, rate of pressure rise and rate of heat release. However, as the 2-butanol addition increases in the blended fuels, increasing trends of in-cylinder pressure, rate of pressure rise and rate of heat release are observed, but it is still lower than G100 fuels. Moreover, even 5%, 10% and 15% additions of 2-butanol in the gasoline fuels improve the COV of IMEP by 3.7, 3.46 and 3.26, respectively, which indicates that the presence of 2-butanol stabilises the combustion process. Comparative analysis of the experimental results by exhaust emissions produced an average of 7.1%, 13.7%, and 19.8% lower NOx for GBu5, GBu10 and GBu15, respectively, over the speed range of 1000-4000 RPM. Other emission contents indicate lower CO and HC but higher CO2 from 2500 to 4000 RPM for the blended fuels with regard to G100. The thermal balance analysis mainly exhibits an improvement in effective power, cooling energy and exhaust energy by average differences of 3.3%, 0.8% and 2.3% for GBu15 compared with G100. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Massively parallel sequencing offers new analytical possibilities enabling a comprehensive study of retrotransposon RNA transcription. We evaluated the expression of long terminal repeat-retrotransposons in leaves of two sister hybrids Populus × canadensis (P. deltoides × P. nigra), subjected to moderate or severe water deprivation by mapping Illumina RNA-Seq reads onto a set of 958 unique full-length retrotransposons of P. trichocarpa. Detectable levels of transcription were ascertained for 140 retrotransposons in 1 hybrid and 182 in the other. The two hybrids showed different retrotransposon expression levels, and these differences reduced at increasing drought levels. The number of expressed Gypsy elements in control and water-deprived plants was higher than those of Copia, as were their expression levels. The two hybrids showed different retrotransposon expression patterns following water deprivation. Such variations between hybrids were related to differential expression of a few genes involved in chromatin methylation and remodeling. Overall, our data indicate that even in genetically close individuals, large differences can occur in retrotransposon expression, with possible consequences for genome differentiation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Copia; Drought; Gypsy; Poplar; Retrotransposon transcription",,"Natali, L.; Department of Agricultural, Via del Borghetto 80, Italy; эл. почта: lucia.natali@unipi.it",,"Springer Verlag",16142942,,,,"English","Tree Genet.

SNPs were selected within 14 previously identified QTL regions, 2916 expressional candidate genes related to rust resistance, wood properties, water-use efficiency and bud phenology and 1732 genes randomly spread across the genome. Over 10 000 SNPs were selected for the construction of a 12k Infinium Bead-Chip array dedicated to association mapping. The SNP genotyping assay was performed with 888 P. nigra individuals. The genotyping success rate was 91%. Our high success rate was due to the discovery panel design and the stringent parameters applied for SNP calling and selection. In the same set of P. nigra genotypes, linkage disequilibrium throughout the genome decayed on average within 5-7 kb to half of its maximum value. As an application test, ADMIXTURE analysis was performed with a selection of 600 SNPs spread throughout the genome and 706 individuals collected along 12 river basins. The admixture pattern was consistent with genetic diversity revealed by neutral markers and the geographical distribution of the populations.

Compared to the previous work, the proposed model not only allows realistic patterns of origin-destination demands, but also considers flow-dependent charging delay induced by congestion at charging stations. With these extensions, the model is better suited to performing a sketchy design of charging infrastructure along highway corridors. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed integer program with nonlinear constraints and solved by a specialized metaheuristic algorithm based on Simulated Annealing. Our numerical experiments show that the metaheuristic produces satisfactory solutions in comparison with benchmark solutions obtained by a mainstream commercial solver, but is more computationally tractable for larger problems. Noteworthy findings from numerical results are: (1) ignoring queuing delay inducted by charging congestion could lead to suboptimal configuration of charging infrastructure, and its effect is expected to be more significant when the market share of PEVs rises; (2) in the absence of the battery cost, it is important to consider the trade-off between the costs of charging delay and the infrastructure; and (3) building long-range PEVs with the current generation of battery technology may not be cost effective from the societal point of view. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Corridor model; Intercity travel; Metaheuristic; Plug-in electric vehicle; Simulated annealing","Competition; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Integer programming; Investments; Plug-in electric vehicles; Secondary batteries; Simulated annealing; Vehicles; Charging infrastructures; Infrastructure investment; Intercity travel; Meta heuristic algorithm; Metaheuristic; Non-linear constraints; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Plug-in electric vehicle charging; Charging (batteries); algorithm; electric vehicle; numerical model; simulated annealing; transportation infrastructure","Nie, Y.M.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 2145 Sheridan Road, United States; эл. почта: y-nie@northwestern.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",0968090X,,,,"English","Transp.

Everything begins in the nose, in which the volatile odorant molecules enter in rhythm with our breathing. At the forefront are the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) which process sensory information by integrating simultaneously, as soon as the first sniff, quantitative, qualitative, and temporal features of stimuli, and send to the next level, the olfactory bulb (OB)-a well-defined description of stimulus attributes. At the OB level, the incoming peripheral message is sorted and, in so doing, an incident functional map is designed. At this level, the sensory information is furthermore amplified, filtered and transformed, all this probably resulting in an olfactory code based on fine temporal tuning of spike activities within mitral-tufted neuron assemblies. Such a multiplexed code based on both temporal and frequency parameters would further use gamma oscillations as a global clock, and appears as especially adapted to face multidimensional stimuli whose inputs are fragmented across OB. Then, the processed olfactory information diverges to the piriform cortex, within the olfactory percept takes shape. At the next stage, the olfactory information is combined together with the information from other sensory organs and compared with previous experiences in order to give the final odor perception. As all the other senses, olfaction can display genetic, gender, and aging variations in performance. In addition, the olfactory function can be impacted by stress, circadian rhythm and, in women, by the reproductive neuroendocrine status. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Odor coding; Odor discrimination; Olfactory bulb; Olfactory cortex; Olfactory mucosa; Olfactory plasticity; Olfactory receptor; Olfactory sensory neuron; Quality coding","Codes (symbols); Neurons; Odors; Olfactory bulbs; Olfactory cortex; Olfactory mucosa; Olfactory receptors; Olfactory sensory neurons; Information filtering","Duchamp-Viret, P.; Neuroscience Research Center of Lyon (CRNL), France",,"Elsevier Inc.",,9780081003008; 9780081002957,,,"English","Flavor: From Food to Behav., Wellbeing and Health",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006414952

Assuming that the burning of biomass is climate-neutral, we compared the well-to-wheel (WtW) emissions from the use of bio-methane in heavy duty engines with those from currently used fossil alternatives: CNG, LNG, and diesel. The well-to-tank (WtT) analysis of bio-methane is based on the case study of the new GoBiGas plant in Gothenburg (Sweden), which is the largest bio-methane plant in the world currently in operation. Finally, tank-to-wheel (TtW) section compares three different state-of-the-art heavy duty gas engines: a spark-ignited (SI) gas engine; a dual fuel (DF) engine; and a high-pressure direct injection (HPDI) engine.The WtT emissions for compressed bio-methane (bio-CNG) and liquefies bio-methane (bio-LNG) were estimated at 21.5 [gCO2e/MJbioCNG] and 26.2 [gCO2e/MJbioLNG]. As compared to diesel the WtW emissions from bio-methane were reduced by 60-67%, 43-47%, and 64% when used in SI, DF, and HPDI engines, respectively. HPDI and DF are the most efficient technologies for the utilization of biomass, reducing emissions by 39 gCO2e and 33-36 gCO2e per MJ of biomass, respectively, compared with the diesel case, whereas the SI engine gave an emissions saving of 29-31 gCO2e. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bio-methane; Dual fuel; Gasification; GoBiGas; Synthetic natural gas; Well-to-wheel","Biomass; Compressed natural gas; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Engines; Gas emissions; Gas engines; Gases; Gasification; Liquefied natural gas; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas transportation; Supply chains; Tanks (containers); Wheels; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Dual-fuels; GoBiGas; High-pressure direct injection; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Synthetic natural gas; Well-to-wheel; Well-to-wheel analysis; Dual fuel engines; biofuel; biogas; biomass power; carbon dioxide; emission control; engine; European Union; liquefied natural gas; methane; traffic emission; transportation mode; Goteborg; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland","Alamia, A.; Chalmers University of Technology, Hörsalsvägen 7, Sweden; эл. почта: alamia@chalmers.se",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Addressing these questions, Constrained Principal Component Analysis and Related Techniques shows how constrained PCA (CPCA) offers a unified framework for these approaches. The book begins with four concrete examples of CPCA that provide readers with a basic understanding of the technique and its applications. It gives a detailed account of two key mathematical ideas in CPCA: projection and singular value decomposition. The author then describes the basic data requirements, models, and analytical tools for CPCA and their immediate extensions. He also introduces techniques that are special cases of or closely related to CPCA and discusses several topics relevant to practical uses of CPCA. The book concludes with a technique that imposes different constraints on different dimensions (DCDD), along with its analytical extensions.

Advanced biotechnologies to treat these effluents are being developed to obtain increased biogas production and other efficient and useful energy sources, such as bio-hydrogen and even bio-electricity. Utilization of these clean energies is significantly lower than other renewables, particularly in developing regions such as Latin-America. This occurs despite the close link between the environmental benefits and sustainable use of this energy, which might be incorporated in different sustainable strategies for local and regional development. This study reviews the 'state of the art' of Latin-American research regarding technologies for energy recovery from agro-industrial wastewaters and their sustainable implementation. It also discusses the need for a more sustainable management of the water-energy nexus in treatment systems used to decont minate effluents, which should be committed to the improvement of renewable energy production and to a more extended regional use.

Rapid epigenetic and genetic changes that affect the transcription of parental genes are frequently observed after polyploidization. The pattern of alternative splicing is also frequently altered, yet the related molecular processes remain largely unresolved. Here, we study the inheritance and expression of parental variants of three floral organ identity genes in allotetraploid tobacco. DEFICIENS and GLOBOSA are B-class genes, and AGA- MOUS is a C-class gene. Parental variants of these genes were found to be maintained in the tobacco genome, and the respective mRNAs were present in flower buds in com- parable amounts. However, among five tobacco cultivars, we identified two in which the majority of paternal GLO- BOSA pre-mRNA transcripts undergo exon 3 skipping, producing an mRNA with a premature termination codon. At the DNA level, we identified a G-A transition at the very last position of exon 3 in both cultivars. Although alternative splicing resulted in a dramatic decrease in full-length paternal GLOBOSA mRNA, no phenotypic effect was observed. Our finding likely serves as an example of the initiation of homoeolog diversification in a relatively young polyploid genome. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.","Alternative splicing; Floral genes; Flowering; Polyploidy; Tobacco","messenger RNA precursor; nucleotide; GLOBOSA protein, plant; homeodomain protein; nucleotide; RNA precursor; vegetable protein; alternative RNA splicing; Article; bud; cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence; controlled study; cultivar; exon; exon skipping; flower; flower morphology; gene expression; gene function; genetic variability; Nicotiana tabacum; nonhuman; plant genome; point mutation; polyploidy; priority journal; tobacco; biosynthesis; exon; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; point mutation; Alternative Splicing; Exons; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Homeodomain Proteins; Nucleotides; Plant Proteins; Point Mutation; Polyploidy; RNA Precursors; Tobacco; Transcription, Genetic","Fulneček, J.; Institute of Biophysics, V.V.I., Kralovopolska 135, Czech Republic; эл. почта: fulnecek@ceitec.muni.cz",,"Springer Verlag",16174615,,MGGOA,"26603606","English","Mol.

In perennial species, breeding is a long process which can be speeded up by gaining knowledge about quantitative trait loci linked to agronomic traits variation. However, due to the long juvenile period of these species, establishing numerous highly recombinant populations for high resolution mapping is both costly and time-consuming. Genome wide association studies in germplasm panels is an alternative method of choice, since it allows identifying the main quantitative trait loci with high resolution by exploiting past recombination events between cultivars. Such studies require adequate panel design to represent most of the available genetic and phenotypic diversity. Assessing linkage disequilibrium extent and panel power is also needed to determine the marker density required for association studies. Results: Starting from the largest grapevine collection worldwide maintained in Vassal (France), we designed a diversity panel of 279 cultivars with limited relatedness, reflecting the low structuration in three genetic pools resulting from different uses (table vs wine) and geographical origin (East vs West), and including the major founders of modern cultivars. With 20 simple sequence repeat markers and five quantitative traits, we showed that our panel adequately captured most of the genetic and phenotypic diversity existing within the entire Vassal collection. To assess linkage disequilibrium extent and panel power, we genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms: 372 over four genomic regions and 129 distributed over the whole genome. Linkage disequilibrium, measured by correlation corrected for kinship, reached 0.2 for a physical distance between 9 and 458 Kb depending on genetic pool and genomic region, with varying size of linkage disequilibrium blocks. This panel achieved reasonable power to detect associations between traits with high broad-sense heritability (> 0.7) and causal loci with intermediate allelic frequency and strong effect (explaining > 10 % of total variance). Conclusions: Our association panel constitutes a new, highly valuable resource for genetic association studies in grapevine, and deserves dissemination to diverse field and greenhouse trials to gain more insight into the genetic control of many agronomic traits and their interaction with the environment. © 2016 Nicolas et al.","Association panel; Genome-wide association studies; Haplotype; Kinship; Linkage disequilibrium; Power; SNP; SSR; sylvestris; Vassal collection; Vitis","genetic marker; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic marker; genetic variation; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotype; phenotype; plant gene; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; species difference; Vitis; Genes, Plant; Genetic Markers; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Linkage Disequilibrium; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Species Specificity; Vitis","Doligez, A.; INRA, France; эл. почта: doligez@supagro.inra.fr",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712229,,,"27005772","English","BMC Plant Biol.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962430700

However, acquisition of sufficient chilling during winter dormancy ensures the normal phenological traits in subsequent growing period. Thus, low temperature appears to play crucial roles in growth and development of temperate plants. Apple, being an important temperate fruit crop, also requires sufficient chilling to release winter dormancy and normal phenological traits, which are often associated with yield and quality of fruits. DNA cytosine methylation is one of the important epigenetic modifications which remarkably affect the gene expression during various developmental and adaptive processes. In present study, methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism was employed to assess the changes in cytosine methylation during dormancy, active growth and fruit set in apple, under differential chilling conditions. Under high chill conditions, total methylation was decreased from 27.2% in dormant bud to 21.0%in fruit set stage, while no significant reduction was found under low chill conditions. Moreover, the demethylation was found to be decreased, while methylation increased from dormant bud to fruit set stage under low chill as compared to high chill conditions. In addition, RNA-Seq analysis showed high expression of DNA methyltransferases and histone methyltransferases during dormancy and fruit set, and low expression of DNA glcosylases during active growth under low chill conditions, which was in accordance with changes in methylation patterns. The RNA-Seq data of 47 genes associated with MSAP fragments involved in cellular metabolism, stress response, antioxidant system and transcriptional regulation showed correlation between methylation and their expression. Similarly, bisulfite sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis of selected genes also showed correlation between gene body methylation and gene expression.

The model predicts behavioral effects of neuronal ablations and genetic perturbations, as well as unexpected aspects of wild type behavior.

A special feature of the RDE tests presented in this paper is that they were performed under Polish conditions and the specified parameters may differ from those in most other European Union countries. Emission correction coefficients have been defined, based on the test results, equal to the increase (or decrease) of driving emissions during the laboratory ('chassis dyno') test or during normal usage in relation to the EU emission standards (emission class) of the vehicle. In relation to the fact that at present emissions limits specified for chassis dynamometer testing are currently used for RDE testing, in this paper we present those limits, proposing that they be accompanied by conformity range coefficients defining the ""safety factor"" for exhaust emissions measured during chassis dyno tests. On the basis of the coefficients defined in this paper, the ecological parameters of vehicles of various emission classes and design parameters (fuel supply systems) are presented. The test results and defined emission correction coefficients permitted an ecological assessment of vehicles of various emission classes to be conducted, and in the meantime they help with pre-emptive actions in terms of reducing emissions of some pollutants from passenger vehicles. The measurement methods applied here can also be used for other types of vehicles (e.g. heavy duty, off-road), or alternative fuel vehicles.

Two kinds of composites that differ by their volume fractions in carbon fiber (56 and 59 vol.%) were tested in this study. The cone calorimeter irradiance level was increased up to 75 kW m-2 to characterize the carbon fiber volume fraction influence on the composite thermal degradation. Thus, main flammability and combustibility parameters were determined and calculated such as mass loss, mass loss rate, ignition time, thermal response parameter, ignition temperature, thermal inertia, and heat of gasification. As a result, all the characteristic parameters for the thermal resistance of composites were decreased when the carbon fiber volume fraction increased. Moreover, the main gaseous products (such as NO, CO, CO2, HCN, H2O, and lightweight hydrocarbons) emitted as well as the oxygen consumption during the composite thermal decomposition were also quantified simultaneously with a portable gas analyzer and a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The main species emission yields calculated from the gas analysis results increased slightly when the carbon fiber volume fraction was increased in the initial sample. The epoxy composite was represented as a sooty material with a significant production of soot particles during the combustion process. Furthermore, heat release rate, total heat release, and effective heat of combustion were calculated by using the oxygen consumption calorimetry technique. The results obtained showed that a small increasing of composite carbon fiber amount induced a sharp decrease of heat release rate and total heat release.

The four cities Jodhpur, New Delhi, Nagpur, and Kolkata, represent different climate types: arid, semi-arid, sub-humid and humid, respectively. For trend analysis, we have used over forty years (1957/60-2003) global solar radiation (RG) and thirty-one years (1973-2003) diffuse solar radiation (RD) observational data. Based on the Mann-Kendall Test (MKT) a significant declining trend in RG (solar dimming) has been observed at the all the stations at p&lt;0.05 during 1957/60-2003. The decreasing trend in RG in past decades indicates the increasing atmospheric load over the four cities of India. Maximum solar dimming has been observed over Jodhpur (-1.54 Wm-2y-1) for the period 1960-2003, followed by New Delhi (-0.98 Wm-2y-1, 1957-2003), Nagpur (-0.79 Wm-2y-1, 1960-2003), and Kolkata (-0.35 Wm-2y-1, 1957-2003).

Over the past two decades, the country has seen rapid economic and population growth and unparalleled land use change. This book explores the challenges of sustaining the resource base while fuelling the economy and providing for a growing population that is greatly dependent on natural resources for income and livelihoods. Adopting a political ecology perspective, this book comprehensively examines human impacts on the environment in Ethiopia, defining the environment both in terms of the quantity and quality of renewable and non-renewable natural resources. With high levels of economic production and consumption also come unintended side effects: waste discharges, emissions of pollutants, and industrial effluents. These pollutants can degrade the quality of water, air, land, and forests as well as harm the health of people, animals, and other living organisms if untreated or disposed of improperly.

With this in mind, Robert Nalbandov examines the milestones of Russia’s international relations since the turn of the twenty-first century. He focuses on the specific goals, engagement practices, and tools used by Putin’s administration to promote Russia’s vital national and strategic interests in specific geographic locations.

A split fuel injection technique is employed, where the first injection is applied during exhaust re-compression and the second injection is applied at the beginning of the main compression. Quantities of fuel injected at the two timings are varied, from the whole fuel injection during NVO to the whole fuel injection during the main compression event. These split-fuel ratio sweeps are repeated both for a stoichiometric mixture and for a slightly lean mixture to determine the effect of an excess air ratio on emissions. It has been found that the employed injection strategy has a great impact on hydrocarbon composition in an exhaust gas as a result of the NVO exhaust-fuel reactions. Fuel injection in an early stage of NVO results in an excessive emission of 1,3-butadiene. Additionally, high emissions of methane are observed, but solely in the lean mixture regime. © 2016 Pol. J.

However, AD is a complex biological process involving many different kinds of microbial communities and biotransformation processes, and it is easily affected by start-up and operation conditions. In order to facilitate improvements in the AD process and enable predictions of biogas production quantities, this review discusses the microbial dynamics, scientific models, and reinforcement strategies of AD biogas production (i.e., sludge pre-treatment, bio-electrochemical and Fe/Fe3O4 technologies). During sludge pre-treatment, the focused-pulsed method can be introduced to promote cell lysis, and this requires specific treatment chamber designs. The bio-electrochemical method, especially in regard to the use of microbial electrolysis cells (MECs), can obviously improve biogas production while only consuming small amounts of energy. Mechanisms of AD-MEC systems and associated influencing factors are described in detail in this review. Engineered nanomaterials, which are increasingly being used in commercial products, may have detrimental or even beneficial effects on the sludge AD process. The use of low doses of Fe/Fe3O4 nanomaterials (≤0.5% (w/w)) as an economically viable and environmentally sustainable method for improving biogas production is discussed. In addition, removal methods for dissolved methane, which can have a negative environmental impact if not handled properly, in the anaerobic digester effluents are discussed in this review. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Effluents; Environmental impact; Iron compounds; Microbial fuel cells; Nanostructured materials; Regenerative fuel cells; Sewage pumping plants; Water treatment plants; Anaerobic digester effluents; Biotransformation process; Engineered nanomaterials; Microbial communities; Microbial electrolysis cell (MECs); Operation conditions; Reinforcement strategies; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment","Wang, H.-C.; School of Environment and Natural Resource, No. 59 Zhongguancun Street, China; эл. почта: whc@ruc.edu.cn",,"Royal Society of Chemistry",20462069,,RSCAC,,"English","RSC Adv.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975068565

For plants, it has also been proposed that unrepaired DNA damage and DNA polymerase errors accumulate in plant cells and lead to increased somatic mutation rate and alterations in transcription, which eventually contribute to plant ageing. A number of studies also show that DNA methylation levels vary depending on the age of plant tissue and chronological age of a whole plant. Recent studies reveal that prolonged cultivation of plant cells in vitro induces single nucleotide substitutions and increases global DNA methylation level in a time-dependent fashion. Changes in DNA methylation are known to influence DNA repair and can lead to altered mutation rates, and, therefore, it is interesting to investigate both the genetic and epigenetic integrity in relationship to ageing in plants. This review will summarise and discuss the current studies investigating somatic DNA mutation and DNA methylation levels in relation to plant ageing and senescence. The analysis has shown that there still remains a lack of clarity concerning plant biological ageing and the role of the genetic and epigenetic instabilities in this process. © 2016 German Botanical Society and Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","DNA methylation; Plant ageing; Plant cell cultures; Plant senescence; Somaclonal variation; Somatic DNA mutations","plant DNA; DNA methylation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; metabolism; mutation; plant; plant cell; DNA Methylation; DNA, Plant; Epigenesis, Genetic; Mutation; Plant Cells; Plants","Dubrovina, A.S.; Laboratory of Biotechnology, Russian Federation; эл. почта: dubrovina@biosoil.ru",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",14358603,,PBIOF,"26211365","English","Plant Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957848393

However linkage mapping is limited to the analysis of traits differing between two lines and the impact of the genetic background on QTL effect has been underlined. Genome-wide association studies (GWAs) were proposed to circumvent these limitations. In tomato, we have shown that GWAs is possible, using the admixed nature of cherry tomato genomes that reduces the impact of population structure. Nevertheless, GWAs success might be limited due to the low decay of linkage disequilibrium, which varies along the genome in this species.Multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations offer an alternative to traditional linkage and GWAs by increasing the precision of QTL mapping. We have developed a MAGIC population by crossing eight tomato lines whose genomes were resequenced. We showed the potential of the MAGIC population when coupled with whole genome sequencing to detect candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying the QTLs. QTLs for fruit quality traits were mapped and related to the variations detected at the genome sequence and expression levels. The advantages and limitations of the three types of population, in the context of the available genome sequence and resequencing facilities, are discussed. © 2015.","Fruit quality; Genome-wide association; QTL mapping; Resequencing; Tomato","chromosomal mapping; cross breeding; DNA sequence; founder effect; fruit; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; inbreeding; plant chromosome; plant genome; population genetics; procedures; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; tomato; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Crosses, Genetic; Founder Effect; Fruit; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome, Plant; Genotype; Inbreeding; Lycopersicon esculentum; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Sequence Analysis, DNA","Causse, M.; INRA, 67 Allée des Chênes CS60094, France; эл. почта: mathilde.causse@avignon.inra.fr",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01689452,,PLSCE,"26566830","English","Plant Sci.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947016925

The goal of this study is to find an optimal bus fleet combination for different driving conditions to minimize life cycle cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and conventional air pollutant emission impacts. For this purpose, a Multi-Objective Linear Programming approach is used to select the optimum bus fleet combinations. Given different weight scenarios, this method could effectively provide solutions for decision makers with various budget constraints or emission reduction requirements. The results indicate that in heavily congested driving cycles such as the Manhattan area, the battery electric bus is the dominant vehicle type, while the hybrid bus has more balanced performances in most scenarios because of its lower initial investment comparing to battery electric buses. Petroleum powered buses have seldom been selected by the model. The trade-off analysis shows that the overall greenhouse gas impact performance is sensitive to the life cycle cost after certain points, which could provide valuable information for the bus fleet combination planning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollutant related health and environmental damage cost; CO2 emission mitigation; Environmental-life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Multi objective linear programming; Transit bus","Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Budget control; Bus transportation; Buses; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Crashworthiness; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Electric batteries; Emission control; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Investments; Life cycle; Linear programming; Pollution; Secondary batteries; Emission mitigation; Environmental damage; Environmental life cycle assessment; Lifecycle costs; Multi-objective linear programming; Transit bus; Environmental impact; alternative fuel; atmospheric pollution; bus transport; carbon emission; emission control; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; linear programing; optimization; transportation planning; United States","Tatari, O.; Department of Civil, United States; эл. почта: tatari@ucf.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949646539

The tests were performed on a Nissan Qashqai HR 16DE engine, with the engine throttle 15% open, a constant stoichiometric fuel mixture and various ignition advance angles. It was found that an increase in added biomethane gas results the drop in engine power output. This effect had two primary causes. First, the cylinders were refilled less effectively. Second, biogas, by impacting the efficiency and speed of the combustion process, reduces the thermal efficiency of the engine. The second effect can be partially improved by accelerating the combustible ignition mixture. It was also observed that CO2 gas, which is in biogas composition, suppress combustion process which increases the content of carbon monoxide (CO) in exhaust gas, but reduces emissions of nitrous oxide (NOx). Increased carbon dioxide amount in fuel mixture has small influence on CO2 increase in exhaust gas because the methane in biogases reduces C/H ratio of the fuel mixture. Hydrocarbons which are in methane composition has smaller molecular mass, evaporates and combust easier which has influence on reduced concentration of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 4,080 genes were differentially expressed between the high-growth vigor allotriploids (SDR-H) and their parents, and 719 genes were non-additively expressed in SDR-H. Differences in gene expression between the allotriploid and male parent were more significant than those between the allotriploid and female parent, which may be caused by maternal effects. We observed 3,559 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the SDR-H and male parent. Notably, the genes were mainly involved in metabolic process, cell proliferation, DNA methylation, cell division, and meristem and developmental growth. Among the 1,056 DEGs between SDR-H and female parent, many genes were associated with metabolic process and carbon utilization.

Their voltage-gating is regulated by cyclic nucleotides and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Activation of HCN channels provides the depolarizing current in response to hyperpolarization that is critical for intrinsic rhythmicity in neurons and the sinoatrial node. Additionally, HCN channels regulate dendritic excitability in a wide variety of neurons. Little is known about the early functional evolution of HCN channels, but the presence of HCN sequences in basal metazoan phyla and choanoflagellates, a protozoan sister group to the metazoans, indicate that the gene family predates metazoan emergence. We functionally characterized two HCN channel orthologs from Nematostella vectensis (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) to determine which properties of HCN channels were established prior to the emergence of bilaterians.We find Nematostella HCN channels share all the major functional features of bilaterian HCNs, including reversed voltage-dependence, activation by cAMP and PIP2, and block by extracellular Cs+. Thus bilaterian-like HCN channels were already present in the common parahoxozoan ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians, at a time when the functional diversity of voltage-gated K+ channels was rapidly expanding.

Economic considerations will be presented to compare the cost of the proposed systems for different scenarios such as carbon-tax rates, diesel fuel cost and ammonia cost. Fossil fuel consumption and the associated negative environmental impact of their combustion is a significant global concern that requires effective, practical, and sustainable solutions. From a Canadian perspective, the Transportation Sector contributes more than 25% of national greenhouse gas emissions due to fossil fuel combustion, largely due to road vehicles (cars, light and heavy duty trucks). This is a complex and critical challenge to address, particularly in urban areas with high population density. There is a need to develop alternative energy solutions for mass passenger and freight transportation systems that will reduce both the traffic-volume of road vehicles as well as the emissions from the mass transportation systems.

Adopting alternative fuel options for public transportation compared to passenger vehicles contributes exponentially to reductions in transportation-related environmental impacts. Therefore, this study aims to present total air pollutant emissions and water withdrawal impacts through the lifetime of a transit bus with different fuel options. Methods: In consideration of market share and future development trends, diesel, biodiesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), hybrid (diesel-electric), and battery electric (BE) transit buses are analyzed with an input-output (IO)-based hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) model. In order to accommodate the sensitivity of total impacts to fuel economy, three commonly used driving cycles are considered: Manhattan, Central Business District (CBD), and Orange County Transit Authority (OCTA). Fuel economy for each of these driving cycles varies over the year with other impacts, so a normal distribution of fuel economy is developed with a Monte Carlo simulation model for each driving cycle and corresponding fuel type. Results and discussion: Impacts from a solar panel (photovoltaic, PV) charging scenario and different grid mix scenarios are evaluated and compared to the nation’s average grid mix impacts from energy generation to accommodate the lifetime electricity needs for the BE transit bus. From these results, it was found that the BE transit bus causes significantly low CO2 emissions than diesel and other alternative fuel options, while some of the driving cycles of the hybrid-powered transit bus cause comparable emissions to BE transit bus. On the other hand, lifetime water withdrawal impacts of the diesel and hybrid options are more feasible compared to other options, since electricity generation and natural gas manufacturing are both heavily dependent on water withdrawal. In addition, the North American Electricity Reliability Corporation’s (NERC) regional electricity grid mix impacts on CO2 emissions and water withdrawal are presented for the BE transit bus. Conclusions: As an addition of current literature, LCA of alternative fuel options was performed in this paper for transit buses with the consideration of a wide variety of environmental indicators. Although the results indicate that BE and hybrid-powered buses have less environmental emissions, the US’s dependency on fossil fuel for electricity generation continues to yield significant lifetime impacts on BE transit bus operation. With respect to water withdrawal impacts, we believe that the adoption of BE transit buses will be faster and more environmentally feasible for some NREC regions than for others. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Alternative fuel-powered transit buses; Electricity grid mix; Environmental life cycle assessment; Monte Carlo simulation; Water withdrawal","biodiesel; carbon dioxide; diesel fuel; fossil fuel; fuel; liquefied natural gas; natural gas; water; air pollutant; Article; car driving; carbon footprint; economic aspect; electric battery; electricity; environmental impact; exhaust gas; life cycle assessment; marketing; motor vehicle; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; traffic and transport","Tatari, O.; Department of Civil, Environmental, and Construction Engineering, University of Central FloridaUnited States",,"Springer Verlag",09483349,,IJLCF,,"English","Int.

However, the magnitude of these energy and emissions savings can vary significantly, due to local conditions and transit operating characteristics. This paper introduces the transit Fuel and Emissions Calculator (FEC), a mode-based life-cycle emissions modeling tool for transit bus and rail technologies that compares the performance of multiple alternative fuels and powertrains across a range of operational characteristics and conditions. The purpose of the FEC is to provide a practical, yet technically sophisticated tool for regulatory agencies and policy analysts in assessing transit fleet options. The FEC's modal modeling approach estimates emissions as a function of engine load, which in turn is a function of transit service parameters, including duty cycle (idling and speed-acceleration profile), road grade, and passenger loading. This approach allows for customized assessments that account for local conditions. Direct emissions estimates are derived from the scaled tractive power (STP) operating mode bins and emissions factors employed in the U.S. EPA's MOVES (MOtor Vehicle Emissions Simulator) model. Life-cycle emissions estimates are calculated using emissions factors from the GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation) model. The case study presented in this paper applies the FEC to second-by-second GPS position data collected from buses operating in metropolitan Atlanta, GA. These operations, from two different transit agencies, feature distinctly different transit service types: local transit bus operations and longer-distance express bus operations. The results illustrate that the decision as to which bus technology-fuel combination produces the least greenhouse gas emissions is a function of location and route characteristics. For the express bus operations monitored, the case study shows that CNG vehicles offer greater emissions reductions than Biodiesel (B20). For local bus services, battery electric buses show the greatest emissions savings in the fuel cycle, as long as range limitations can be met for the specific routes. The amount of these emissions savings is, however, highly dependent on the power generation mix. Among CNG, B20, parallel hybrid, series hybrid, and fuel cell buses, the least emitting option varies by location, due to complex interactions of factors such as duty cycle, meteorology, and terrain. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Alternative fuels; Energy consumption; Life-cycle assessment; Mode-based emissions modeling; Transit","Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Bus transportation; Buses; Compressed natural gas; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Powertrains; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Emissions model; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Motor vehicle emissions; Operating characteristics; Operational characteristics; Reduce energy consumption; Transit; Gas emissions; alternative fuel; bus transport; carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; metropolitan area; sustainable development; Atlanta; Georgia; United States","Xu, Y.790 Atlantic Drive Northwest, United States; эл. почта: yanzhi.xu@ce.gatech.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

This study provides a comparative LCA of remanufactured liquefied natural gas (LNG) and diesel engines. Furthermore, the paper identifies the processes that contribute most to energy consumption and environmental impacts during the life cycles of the two engines. Six environmental impacts were considered in this study: global warming potential (GWP); acidification potential (AP); eutrophication potential (EP); photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP); ozone depletion potential (ODP); and primary energy demand (PED). The results show that remanufacturing LNG engines reduces energy consumption by 41.91% compared with remanufacturing diesel engines. The greatest benefit related to the environmental impacts is EP, which is reduced by 73.69%, followed by AP, GWP and POCP, which are reduced by 71.49%, 47.14% and 43.90%, respectively. In addition, the cost benefit of the entire life cycle is also significant for LNG engines. In the life cycle of the two types of remanufactured engines, engine usage causes larger environmental impacts, especially with regard to PED and POCP, and component remanufacturing contributes most to ODP. However, it should be noted that in the remanufacturing stage, because more materials and energy are consumed for the LNG engine, the environmental impacts and costs are higher than those for the diesel engine. Nevertheless, the advantages of remanufacturing end-of-life diesel engines into LNG engines are obvious because of the significant benefits during LNG engine use. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Diesel engine; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment (LCA); LNG engine; Remanufacturing","Cost benefit analysis; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Gas fuel purification; Global warming; Life cycle; Liquefied natural gas; Ozone; Ozone layer; Comparative life cycle assessment; Eutrophication potentials; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); LNG engines; Ozone depletion potential; Photochemical ozone creation potentials; Remanufacturing; Diesel engines","Li, T.; Institute of Sustainable Design and Manufacturing, China; эл. почта: litao@dlut.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

It then explores how a heartbeat can maintain a rhythm, albeit slower, for hours without any oxygen, and sometimes without autonomic innervation. It closes with a discussion of recent work on fishes, where the cardiac rhythm can become arrhythmic when a fish experiences extreme heat. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Anoxia; Carp; Hagfish; HCN; Heart rate; Hypoxia; Salmon; Temperature; Turtle","adrenalin; catecholamine; hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel; ice; noradrenalin; fish protein; hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel; adrenergic stimulation; anoxia; autonomic innervation; bradycardia; cardiovascular function; cold acclimatization; down regulation; fish; hagfish; heart atrium contraction; heart beat; heart depolarization; heart innervation; heart muscle fiber membrane potential; heart output; heart rate; heart stroke volume; hypoxia; nonhuman; Review; sarcoplasmic reticulum; sinus node; sinus rhythm; survival; teleost; turtle; warming; water temperature; winter; adverse effects; animal; anoxia; biological model; biological rhythm; genetics; heat; molecular evolution; pathophysiology; phylogeny; physiology; Animalia; Cyprinidae; Eptatretus stoutii; hagfish; Pisces; Testudines; Animals; Anoxia; Biological Clocks; Evolution, Molecular; Fish Proteins; Hagfishes; Heart Rate; Hot Temperature; Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channels; Models, Cardiovascular; Phylogeny","Wilson, C.M.; Department of Zoology, Canada",,"Elsevier Inc.",10956433,,CBPAB,"25178563","English","Comp.

The growing demand for container transport is only sustainable if transport becomes 'greener'. There are innovations, which unite economic and environmental interests. One example is the ongoing increase in ship size, which reduces the cost of shipping by reducing fuel consumption and emissions per container. Another example is the use of alternative fuel (blend)s in ship engines. The central theme in this paper is to better understand the impact of replacing standard fuels in engines of large(r) container ships by alternative fuels (biodiesel, LNG/CNG) on CO 2 NO x and PM 10 emissions. This leads to the following questions: Can alternative fuels help to significantly reduce CO 2 , NO x and PM 10 emissions in port areas? Does their use allow compensation of the growth in emissions due to the growth in container shipping? It is shown for a typical seaport container terminal that cleaner fuels can contribute to lowering these emissions, even if the volume of containers handled by this terminal triples. The use of what seems, at first glance, to be cleaner fuels may, however, open a Pandora's Box as a widespread use of organic biofuel may create other serious environmental problems, additional pressure on local food supply and social stability in already vulnerable areas of the world. More use of natural gas also raises serious environmental concerns. © WIT Press 2015.","Climate change; Container transport; Emissions; Fuels; Ports; Tradeoffs",,"Vleugel, J.M.; Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Netherlands","Brebbia C.A.","WITPress",1746448X,9781845649708,,,"English","WIT Trans.

Maintenance DNA methylation in plants occurs at symmetrical mCG and mCHG contexts (m = methylated) and is maintained by DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) and CHROMOMETHYLASE (CMT) DNA methyltransferase protein families, respectively. While angiosperm genomes encode for several members of MET1 and CMT families, the moss Physcomitrella patens, serving as a model for early divergent land plants, carries a single member of each family. To determine the function of P. patens PpMET we generated ΔPpmet deletion mutant which lost mCG and unexpectedly mCCG methylation at loci tested. In order to evaluate the extent of mCCG methylation by MET1, we reexamined the Arabidopsis thaliana Atmet1 mutant methylome and found a similar pattern of methylation loss, suggesting that maintenance of DNA methylation by MET1 is conserved through land plant evolution. While ΔPpmet displayed no phenotypic alterations during its gametophytic phase, it failed to develop sporophytes, indicating that PpMET plays a role in gametogenesis or early sporophyte development. Expression array analysis revealed that the deletion of PpMET resulted in upregulation of two genes and multiple repetitive sequences. In parallel, expression analysis of the previously reported ΔPpcmt mutant showed that lack of PpCMT triggers overexpression of genes. This overexpression combined with loss of mCHG and its pleiotropic phenotype, implies that PpCMT has an essential evolutionary conserved role in the epigenetic control of gene expression. Collectively, our results suggest functional conservation of MET1 and CMT families during land plant evolution. A model describing the relationship between MET1 and CMT in CCG methylation is presented. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CCG CG CHG maintenance DNA methylation; Chromomethylase CMT; DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 MET1; Epigenetic regulation of development; Physcomitrella patens phase transition; Quantification of gene copy number","Arabidopsis thaliana; Bryophyta; Embryophyta; Magnoliophyta; Physcomitrella patens; alcohol dehydrogenase; chromomethylase; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase; lactate-malate transhydrogenase; plant DNA; vegetable protein; biological model; Bryopsida; DNA methylation; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular genetics; mutation; nucleotide sequence; plant gene; transgenic plant; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Base Sequence; Bryopsida; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase; DNA Methylation; DNA, Plant; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Models, Biological; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified","Ohad, N.; Department of Molecular Biology and Ecology of Plants, Israel; эл. почта: niro@tauex.tau.ac.il",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674412,,PMBID,"25944663","English","Plant.

Based on the COSM, three scenarios were developed to evaluate the oil-saving pathway in terms of imported crude oil price, available alternative fuels and GHG emission reduction. The scenario analysis results indicate that: (1) for scenario A, the accumulated oil-saving potential was approximately about 13%, while the oil-saving potential of improving fuel consumption rate and load running rate was 17% and 16%; (2) for scenario B, the accumulated oil-saving potential increased to 82% in reference oil price and 23% in low oil price; (3) for scenario C, to reduce per ton of GHG emission, the increased cost will increase from 34 USD to 450 USD when the GHG emission target decreased from 15.4 billion tons to the turn point of 13.5 billion tons. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Alternative fuel; Cost-optimization; GHG emission; Oil saving; Road freight transportation","Alternative fuels; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Emission control; Freight transportation; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum transportation; Roads and streets; Cost effective; Cost optimization; Fuel consumption rates; GHG emission; Oil savings; Road freight transportations; Scenario analysis; Superstructure models; Crude oil price; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; energy planning; energy use; freight transport; optimization; China","Ma, L.; Tsinghua UniversityChina; эл. почта: malinwei@tsinghua.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931563124

The IWI/CS-X (X=5, 10, 30 and 50, represented the Co3O4 loading as wt%) samples prepared via IWI/CS method exhibited higher catalytic activity than the IWI-X (X=5, 10, 30 and 50) ones via IWI method. IWI/CS-30 showed the highest catalytic activity with T10 (10% CH4 conversion) at 300°C and T100 (complete conversion) at 550°C. The structure characterization indicated the IWI/CS-X catalysts had a greater surface area with relatively lower Co3O4 crystallization and better Co3O4 dispersion compared with IWI-X samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-vis results revealed that surface Co3+/(Co2++Co3+) ratios of the IWI/CS-X samples was relatively higher than those of IWI-X ones. The surface Co3+ of the IWI/CS-X catalysts was easily reduced to Co2+ at 280-330°C, whereas, only one difficult reduction process of Co3O4 to Co0 was observed at 400-600°C for all of the IWI-X samples according to hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) results. Hence, the abundance of surface Co3+, easy and fast redox cycle between Co2+ and Co3+ at low temperatures were the underlying mechanisms for the excellent catalytic performance of IWI/CS-X catalysts in CH4 combustion. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Catalytic combustion of methane; Cobalt species; Combustion synthesis; Reducibility; Supported catalyst","Aluminum compounds; C (programming language); Catalysis; Catalyst supports; Cobalt; Cobalt metallography; Combustion synthesis; Methane; Redox reactions; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Catalytic combustion of methane; Catalytic evaluation; Catalytic performance; Cobalt species; Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction; Incipientwetness impregnation; Reducibility; Structure characterization; Catalyst activity","Fu, J.; School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Daniel Lab 304, United States",,"Elsevier B.V.",09263373,,ACBEE,,"English","Appl.

Design/methodology/approach – A literature review of published, conference proceedings, agency reports, books, and web site documents was conducted, aiming at the identification of the diverging strategies and practices undertaken by transportation stakeholders in order to be able to generate initial meaningful insights about a sustainable transportation system. Findings – Sustainable transportation systems are in certain way a new paradigm where a business-as-usual approach is not possible. Vehicle makers produce more energy efficient vehicles. Nevertheless, fossil fuel is still the predominant source of energy. Regarding the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, non-motorized transport modes are preferable over motorized transport modes, and public transportation modes preferable to private transportation modes. It is also import to include environmental consideration along the design, construction, maintenance, and operation of the transportation infrastructure. While vehicles powered by alternate fuel such as biofuel, electricity, and/or fuel cell are becoming more popular, shifting to more sustainable transport modes would also require changes on commuter behaviors and individual preferences. Practical implications – The paper discusses the efforts that are underway for decoupling transport and CO2 emissions, being useful for transportation stakeholders to implement or improve the effectiveness of their potential or current sustainability transport initiatives through the identification of strategies, opportunities, and barriers. Originality/value – Although there is plenty of good information about sustainability and transportation modes in literature, most of the articles analyzed focus on specific factors of the whole transportation system. The originality/value of this paper is found in the holistic perspective, here presented, of the state of the art issues that a sustainable transport system would encompass. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Climate change; CO2 emissions; Sustainable transport; Sustainable vehicles Paper type Literature review",,"Velazquez, L.; Industrial Engineering Department, Mexico; эл. почта: Luis_Velazquez@industrial.uson.mx",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14777835,,,,"English","Manage.

The most direct route to producing biofuels from brown algae is via anaerobic digestion (AD) process. Although the application of brown algae for AD process is still at an early stage, there is almost no technical barrier to the process, particularly as an additional feedstock for existing AD may contribute to the fast development of industrial biofuel application. This review provides an overall perspective required for an advanced assessment of the development of brown algae as a sustainable biofuel resource from the AD process. © The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Anaerobic Digestion Process; Biofuels; Biomethane; Brown Algae; Volatile Fatty Acids",,"Woo, H.C.; Department of Chemical Engineering, 365, Sinseon-ro, South Korea",,"Springer New York LLC",02561115,,,,"English","Korean J.

Among these gravity deposits, several relatively thick debrites (up to 12 m) have been observed and studied in detail. Sedimentological analyses have been performed and because of non-turbulent behavior of debris flows, detailed micropaleontological studies could be realized. Planktonic foraminifera thus allowed establishing a detailed biostratigraphy of these deposits. Benthic foraminifer and ostracod assemblages were used to evaluate the origin of the sediment composing these debris flows and estimate their run-out distance. These debrites are dated from Early Pliocene and early Pleistocene, and were deposited in a mesobathyal environment. They comprise silty mud clasts and matrixes with sand content up to 34%. The Early Pliocene debrites are bioclast-rich whereas the Early Pleistocene debrite is enriched in terrigenous particles. The data indicates that these debrites were triggered on the continental shelf and traveled less than 100 km, eroding the seafloor all along their path for the Early Pliocene debrites and only the first part of their path for the early Pleistocene debrite. Matrixes originate from failure areas whereas eroded sediments along the flow pathway are incorporated into the flow as clasts. High abundance of shelf fauna during the Early Pliocene and great supply of terrigenous particles from rivers during the early Pleistocene in the south-western Iberian margin have favored gravity flows from the continental shelf to the slope. The contouritic paleo-moat of the Faro drift has been a determining channeling feature for gravity flows along the Algarve margin during the early Pleistocene, testifying of the strong interaction between MOW circulation and down-slope processes. Tectonic and diapiric activities were significant during Early Pliocene and early Pleistocene on the Algarve margin and could have been triggering parameters of failures related to these debris flows. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Algarve margin; Debrite; Erosion; Foraminiferal assemblages; Ostracods; Plio-pleistocene","Animals; Deposits; Erosion; Sediments; Algarve margin; Debrite; Foraminiferal assemblages; Ostracods; Plio-pleistocene; Debris; abundance; bathyal zone; biostratigraphy; continental shelf; debris flow; erosion; foraminifera; micropaleontology; ostracod; Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary; seafloor; sedimentology; Algarve; Atlantic Ocean; Faro [Portugal]; Gulf of Cadiz; Portugal; Foraminifera; Ostracoda","Ducassou, E.; Université de Bordeaux, France; эл. почта: e.ducassou@epoc.u-bordeaux1.fr",,"Elsevier B.V.",00253227,,MAGEA,,"English","Mar.

The present study reports the development of seaweed variants with improved agronomic traits through protoplast fusion between Monostroma oxyspermum (Kutz.) Doty and Ulva reticulata Forsskal. A total of 12 putative hybrids were screened based on the variations in morphology and total DNA content over the fusion partners. DNA-fingerprinting by inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis confirmed genomic introgression in the hybrids. The DNA fingerprint revealed sharing of parental alleles in regenerated hybrids and a few alleles that were unique to hybrids. The epigenetic variations in hybrids estimated in terms of DNA methylation polymorphism also revealed sharing of methylation loci with both the fusion partners. The functional trait analysis for growth showed a hybrid with heterotic trait (DGR% = 36.7 ± 1.55%) over the fusion partners U. reticulata (33.2 ± 2.6%) and M. oxyspermum (17.8 ± 1.77%), while others were superior to the mid-parental value (25.2 ± 2.2%) (p < 0.05). The fatty acid (FA) analysis of hybrids showed notable variations over fusion partners. Most hybrids showed increased polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) compared to saturated FAs (SFAs) and mainly includes the nutritionally important linoleic acid, a-linolenic acid, oleic acid, stearidonic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. The other differences observed include superior cellulose content and antioxidative potential in hybrids over fusion partners. The hybrid varieties with superior traits developed in this study unequivocally demonstrate the significance of protoplast fusion technique in developing improved varients of macroalgae. © 2015 Gupta, Kumari and Reddy.","Heterosis; Hybrid; Monostroma; Protoplast; Ulva","Monostroma; Monostroma oxyspermum; Ulva; Ulva reticulata; Ulvophyceae","Reddy, C.R.K.; Seaweed Biology and Cultivation Group, India; эл. почта: crk@csmcri.org",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",1664462X,,,,"English","Front.

In the aquifer system of Albufeira-Ribeira de Quarteira, one of these coastal systems, several freshwater discharges were identified on the Algarve shelf up to 5.6 km from the coastline. Two submarine springs closer to the coast (120 m south from the intertidal springs of the Olhos de Água beach) were selected, among others, for sampling and field parameters monitoring such as electrical conductivity and temperature by divers. The discharges were characterized from the hydrogeochemical point of view and compared with the characteristics of the onshore aquifer system. SGD have a Cl-Na facies, with seawater fractions of 25 % and 29 %, electrical conductivity of 9000 µS/cm, temperature of 19.8°C, pe of 6.65 and 6.91, pH of 6.34 and 7.16, being close to equilibrium in relation to carbonates, and a source of nutrients for seawater contributing with nitrate, ammonium and silica.

To upgrade the quality of the biogas, wet scrubber unit has been designed for removing carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and for enriching the methane (CH4) percentage by using water as an absorbent along with plastic balls. Historical design is employed to optimise the process parameters of wet scrubber like gas pressure, water flow rate (WFR) and gas flow rate (GFR) to obtain optimum methane percentage after scrubbing.

The main sources of PAHs can be classified as either pyrogenic or petrogenic (Sanders et al. 2002; Dahle et al. 2003). Pyrogenic-derived PAHs originate from oxygen-depleted, high-temperature processes such as incomplete combustion, pyrolysis, cracking, and destructive distillation. Petrogenic-derived PAHs originate from petroleum, including crude oil, fuels, lubricants, and derivatives of those materials. The composition of PAHs from pyrogenic and petrogenic sources differs. Pyrogenic PAHs are composed of approximately 60% alkyd compounds, while petrogenic PAHs are composed of up to 99% alkyd congeners (Hawthorne et al. 2006). PAHs enter the aquatic environment from incomplete combustion of organic materials, fossil fuels, petroleum product spillage, and various industrial activities, as well as from natural processes such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions. Human exposure to PAHs can take place through multiple routes, including air, soil, food, water, and occupational exposure. They have detrimental effects on the flora and fauna of affected habitats, resulting in the uptake and accumulation of toxic chemicals in food chains and potential serious health problems or genetic defects in humans (WHO 1998; WHO 2000; USEPA 2001; Srogi 2007). © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Kochany, J.; Environmental Consultant MississaugaCanada",,"CRC Press",,9781482243185; 9781138893900,,,"English","Wastewater Treatment: Occurrence and Fate of Polycycl.

The primary goals of the present study were to establish a Clementine reference map, and to perform comparative mapping with pummelo and sweet orange. Five parental genetic maps were established with SNPs, SSRs and InDels. A medium density reference map (961 markers for 1084.1 cM) of Clementine was established and used by the ICGC to facilitate the chromosome assembly of the haploid genome sequence. Comparative mapping with pummelo and sweet orange revealed that the linear order of markers was highly conserved. Reasonable inferences of most citrus genomes should be obtained by mapping next-generation sequencing data against the haploid reference genome sequence. Skewed segregations were frequent and higher in the male than female Clementine potentially leading to false interpretation of the genetic determinism of phenotypic traits. The mapping data confirmed that Clementine arose from hybridization between 'Mediterranean' mandarin and sweet orange and identified nine recombination break points for the sweet orange gamete that contributed to the Clementine genome. Introgression of pummelo genome fragments were identified in heterozygosity in each chromosome. Moreover, it appeared that the genome of the haploid Clementine used to establish the citrus reference genome sequence was inherited primarily from the 'Mediterranean' mandarin. The usefulness of this genetic map, anchored in the reference whole genome sequence, is discussed.","C. Clementina; C. Maxima; C.

We test whether crustaceans have nociceptors by examining nociceptive behaviours and neurophysiological responses to extreme temperatures and potentially nocigenic chemicals. Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) respond quickly and strongly to high temperatures, and neurons in the antenna show increased responses to transient high temperature stimuli. Crayfish showed no difference in behavioural response to low temperature stimuli. Crayfish also showed no significant changes in behaviour when stimulated with capsaicin or isothiocyanate compared to controls, and neurons in the antenna did not change their firing rate following application of capsaicin or isothiocyanate. Noxious high temperatures appear to be a potentially ecologically relevant noxious stimulus for crayfish that can be detected by sensory neurons, which may be specialized nociceptors. © 2015.

The emission sources of PM studied in this work was cooking, vacuuming, ironing and the use of deodorant spray.Cooking activities were expected to be one of the major sources of indoor particles and the features of the cookers may affect the characteristics of emissions resulting from cooking. For this reason, the results of a previous study based on the variability of the power of the cooker were reported, to study the sustainability of natural gas from the point of view of the induced indoor human exposure to PM. Measurements were performed by a GRIMM analyser, able to measure 16 granulometric classes from 0.3 to 20 μm.

The survey data were collected from 291 household foresters, who were growing Eucalyptus urophylla and Acacia mangium in Yen Bai Province, Vietnam. The regression exercise suggests that financial status was negatively correlated with forest management practices, and ethnicity and financial status were correlated with carbon sequestration management. The survey results suggest that the mean rotation age employed by household foresters is five years. However, the optimization modelling suggests that the optimal rotation age for maximizing net present value is greater than nine years. The differences between current practices and optimal practices therefore favour a role for government policy interventions. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.",,,"Nghiem, N.; Department of Public Health, University of Otago, P.O.

Further emphasis was made on source identification of HCHO emissions. It revealed that agriculture fires and extensive use of compressed natural gas (CNG) as fuel also contribute to tropospheric HCHO in Pakistan.

The aim is to provide the various private and public decision makers with information that could allow them to better understand the current market penetration of the various automotive technologies and to predict the future one. It is found that the car operated by conventional fuels (gasoline, diesel) is currently the least expensive as far as the total costs of ownership are concerned. The bi-fuel liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and the bi-fuel compressed natural gas (CNG) internal combustion engine vehicles are in the same price range. Both the battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and, especially, the hybrid ICEVs are more expensive. On the contrary, the social lifecycle costs of the BEVs are the lowest, thanks not only to their zero air pollutants' emissions in the use phase but also to their reduced noise emissions. The amount of the social costs relative to the total cost of ownership, estimated using recent European parameters, represents at the most 6% of the total cost. Consequently, even if the external costs were internalized, the alternative fuel vehicles would not become convenient for the final consumer from a monetary point of view. Considering the energy consumption, with the 2011 Italian energy production mix, the BEVs and the diesel hybrid are the most energy efficient cars. Focusing on 7 specific models, and simulating realistic scenarios, it is found that the relative ranking of the BEVs in terms of total costs improves moderately when the traveled distance increases, subsidies are introduced and battery price drops. However, the BEVs become convenient only when the annual distance traveled is at least 20,000 km, a value much higher than the current Italian average and posing serious issues in terms of vehicles' range. Only a joint reduction of the battery price to €240/kWh from initial estimated cost of €412/kWh and the introduction of a subsidy would make the BEVs competitive with the current average Italian annual distance traveled. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Car; Electric vehicle; Energy consumption; Social cost; Total cost of ownership",,"Danielis, R.; Dipartimento di Scienze Economiche, Aziendali, Matematiche e Statistiche, Università degli Studi di Trieste, P.le Europa, 1, Italy",,"JAI Press",07398859,,,,"English","Res.

Patients become infected by inhaling airborne spores or desiccated yeast cells from the environment, where the fungus thrives in avian droppings, trees and soil. To investigate the prevalence and population structure of Cng in southern Africa, we analysed isolates from 77 environmental samples and 64 patients. We detected significant genetic diversity among isolates and strong evidence of geographic structure at the local level. High proportions of isolates with the rare MATa allele were observed in both clinical and environmental isolates; however, the mating-type alleles were unevenly distributed among different subpopulations. Nearly equal proportions of the MATa and MATa mating types were observed among all clinical isolates and in one environmental subpopulation from the eastern part of Botswana. As previously reported, there was evidence of both clonality and recombination in different geographic areas. These results provide a foundation for subsequent genomewide association studies to identify genes and genotypes linked to pathogenicity in humans. © 2015 The Authors.","Cryptococcus neoformans; Genotyping; Population structure; Recombination","fungal DNA; allele; Botswana; cryptococcosis; Cryptococcus neoformans; DNA sequence; environment; fungal mating type gene; genetic variation; genetics; geography; human; microbiology; molecular genetics; multilocus sequence typing; population genetics; tree; Alleles; Botswana; Cryptococcosis; Cryptococcus neoformans; DNA, Fungal; Environment; Genes, Mating Type, Fungal; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Trees","Chen, Y.; Division of Infectious Diseases, 163 Hanes House, Trent Drive, United States; эл. почта: ychenbioinfo@gmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09621083,,MOECE,"26053414","English","Mol.

We studied inheritance of restriction site polymorphisms by the f-AFLP method and epigenetic DNA cytosine methylation inheritance by the f-MSAP technique. The study involved parents and 190 progeny of a Cupressus sempervirens L. full-sib family. Results from AFLP genetic data revealed that 71.8% of the fragments studied are under Mendelian genetic control, whereas faithful Mendelian inheritance for the MSAP fragments was low (4.29%). Further, MSAP fragment analysis showed that total methylation presented a mean of 28.2%, which was higher than the midparent value, while maternal inheritance was higher (5.65%) than paternal (3.01%). Interestingly de novo methylation in the progeny was high (19.65%) compared to parental methylation. Genetic and epigenetic distances for parents and offspring were not correlated (R2=0.0005). Furthermore, we studied correlation of total relative methylation and CG methylation with growth (height, diameter). We found CG/CNG methylation (N: A, C, T) to be positively correlated with height and diameter, while total relative methylation and CG methylation were positively correlated with height.

Vomeronasal stimuli are typically secreted in various body fluids. Following direct contact with urine deposits or other secretions, a peristaltic vascular pump mediates fluid entry into the recipient’s VNO. Therefore, while vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) sample various stimulatory semio-chemicals dissolved in the intraluminal mucus, they might also be affected by the general physicochemical properties of the “solvent.” Here, we report cycle stage-correlated variations in urinary pH among female mice. Estrus-specific pH decline is observed exclusively in urine samples from sexually experienced females. Moreover, patch-clamp recordings in acute VNO slices reveal that mouse VSNs reliably detect extracellular acidosis. Acid-evoked responses share the biophysical and pharmacological hallmarks of the hyperpolarization-activated current Ih. Mechanistically, VSN acid sensitivity depends on a pH-induced shift in the voltage-dependence of Ih activation that causes the opening of HCN channels at rest, thereby increasing VSN excitability. Together, our results identify extracellular acidification as apotent activator of vomeronasal Ih and suggest HCN channel-dependent vomeronasal gain control of social chemosignaling. Our data thus reveal a potential mechanistic basis for stimulus pH detection in rodent chemosensory communication. © 2015 the authors.","HCN; Ion channel; Signaling; Vomeronasal organ","adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain electrophysiology; controlled study; estrus cycle; experimental behavioral test; female; fluorescence imaging; immunohistochemistry; male; mouse; nerve cell excitability; nonhuman; patch clamp technique; pH; pH measurement; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; stimulus response; tracheotomy; urinalysis; urine pH; vomeronasal organ; vomeronasal sensory neuron; Western blotting; young adult; animal; C57BL mouse; cytology; estrus; genetics; olfactory bulb; pH; physiology; sensory nerve cell; vomeronasal organ; transient receptor potential channel C; Trpc2 protein, mouse; Animals; Estrus; Female; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Olfactory Bulb; Patch-Clamp Techniques; Sensory Receptor Cells; TRPC Cation Channels; Vomeronasal Organ","Spehr, X.; RWTH Aachen University, Institute for Biology II/Depart-mentofChemosensation, 2Sammelbau Biologie, Room 1.129, Worringerweg3, Germany",,"Society for Neuroscience",02706474,,JNRSD,"25740530","English","J.

However, there is far less information about this family in woody plants such as pear. Here, we provided a genome-wide identification and analysis of the CNGC gene family in pear. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 21 pear CNGC genes could be divided into five groups (I, II, III, IVA and IVB). The majority of gene duplications in pear appeared to have been caused by segmental duplication and occurred 32.94-39.14million years ago. Evolutionary analysis showed that positive selection had driven the evolution of pear CNGCs. Motif analyses showed that Group I CNGCs generally contained 26 motifs, which was the greatest number of motifs in all CNGC groups. Among these, eight motifs were shared by each group, suggesting that these domains play a conservative role in CNGC activity. Tissue-specific expression analysis indicated that functional diversification of the duplicated CNGC genes was a major feature of long-term evolution. Our results also suggested that the P-S6 and PBC & hinge domains had co-evolved during the evolution. These results provide valuable information to increase our understanding of the function, evolution and expression analyses of the CNGC gene family in higher plants. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","CNGC; Expression pattern; Gene duplication; Gene family; Pear; Phylogenetic analysis","cyclic nucleotide gated channel; cyclic nucleotide gated channel; vegetable protein; Article; coevolution; controlled study; cyclic nucleotide gated channel gene; gene duplication; gene expression; genetic selection; genomics; hinge region; multigene family; nonhuman; pear; phylogeny; positive selection; protein domain; protein motif; Pyrus bretchneideri; segmental duplication; tissue distribution; antibody specificity; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; molecular evolution; Pyrus; Embryophyta; Pyrus; Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Duplication; Multigene Family; Organ Specificity; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Pyrus; Selection, Genetic","Zhang, S.No 6.

Concrete perspectives towards unifying these approaches are offered by studies on the physiological systems that depend on ion channel dynamics. I focus on the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels implicated in the photoreceptor's response to light. From an evolutionary standpoint, sensory systems offers interpretative advantages, as the relation between the sensory response and environment is relatively straightforward. For CNG and other ion channels, extensive data are available about the physiological consequences of scanning mutagenesis on sensitive protein domains, such as the conduction pore. Mutant ion channels can be easily studied in living cells, so that the relation between genotypes and phenotypes is less speculative than usual. By relying on relatively simple theoretical frameworks, I used these data to relate the sequence space with phenotypes at increasing hierarchical levels. These empirical genotype-phenotype and phenotype-phenotype landscapes became smoother at higher integration levels, especially in heterozygous condition.

In this case study, the oil and gas industry appropriates established environmental justice discourses to assert that (1) fracking is clean and environmentally responsible, (2) it will help sustain local families and communities for many generations to come, and (3) fracking locally results in scalar, global benefit. Furthermore, the industry employs ad-hominum attacks and debunking strategies to frame anti-fracking activists as impractical alarmists. Through this rhetorical representation of space, the industry defines the process and associated values of fracking as desirable, inevitable, and most importantly, a sustainable process with just outcomes. Ultimately, the material reality of how the risks and benefits are distributed across the local, national, and global landscape through spatial practice is masked. Focusing exclusively on discourse ignores the real material conditions that give rise to and result from that discourse. Therefore, we argue Lefebvre's (1991) trialectic offers a way to address the interplay between representations and discourses of space and material reality. © 2014 Institute for Human Geography.","Environmental Justice; Fracking; Hydraulic Fracturing; Justicia Medioambiental; Representaciones del Espacio; Representations of Space; Retórica; Rhetoric",,,,"SAGE Publications Inc.",19427786,,,,"English","Hum.

To evaluate environmental risk of the emission of biogas slurry, luminescent bacteria (Vibrio fischeri), larvae and embryos of zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to detect the acute and development toxicity of digested and post-treated slurry. Then the ability of treatment process was evaluated. The results showed that digested slurry displayed strong toxicity to both zebrafish and luminescent bacteria, while the EC50 for luminescent bacteria and the LC50 for larvae were only 6.81% (v/v) and 1.95% (v/v) respectively, and embryonic development was inhibited at just 1% (v/v). Slurry still maintained a high level of toxicity although it had been treated by membrane bioreactor (MBR), while the LC50 of larvae was 75.23% (v/v) and there was a little effect on the development of embryos and V. fischeri; the results also revealed that the zebrafish larvae are more sensitive than embryos and luminescent bacteria to pig slurry. Finally, we also found the toxicity removal rate was higher than 90% after the treatment of MBR according to toxicity tests.

It references the world of the social: attitudes to safety and security, relations of race and class, habitations of humans and those of animals, the place of the rural within the urban, and the continuum on which legal and illegal practices locate themselves. It is a book about space: the specific sites at which environmental issues are most prominently posed, such as rivers and slaughterhouses, streets and factories, and slums and public spaces. It is about bio-physical resources: air and water, their contamination and possible states of purity. The description of these issues also raises questions about modes of comprehension. Hence, the book pays close attention to social surveys and scientific standards, sifting through the emotional registers of pain and prejudice, and mining the vocabulary of planning, governance, and the measures of risk. Finally, it situates itself in contested domains, for efforts at environmental improvement in the city of Delhi, as elsewhere, have been aimed not only at securing cleaner biophysical resources and better health but also about possibilities of creating alternate ways of dwelling in the city. In the colonial period, this multiplicity of urban forms was most evident in the distinction between the old city and the new capital and between the natives' quarters and those of the ruling race. In the postcolonial city, planned and informal spaces, legal and illegal practices, and legible and uncertain conditions have been the more prominent distinctions for articulating alternative modes of urban dwelling. © Oxford University Press 2014.

The cellular-molecular basis for sensing humidity is unknown in most animals, however. We used the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to uncover a mechanism for sensing humidity. We found that whereas C. elegans showed no obvious preference for humidity levels under standard culture conditions, worms displayed a strong preference after pairing starvation with different humidity levels, orienting to gradients as shallow as 0.03% relative humidity per millimeter. Cell-specific ablation and rescue experiments demonstrate that orientation to humidity in C. elegans requires the obligatory combination of distinct mechanosensitive and thermosensitive pathways. The mechanosensitive pathway requires a conserved DEG/ENaC/ASIC mechanoreceptor complex in the FLP neuron pair. Because humidity levels influence the hydration of the worm' s cuticle, our results suggest that FLP may convey humidity information by reporting the degree that subcuticular dendritic sensory branches of FLP neurons are stretched by hydration. The thermosensitive pathway requires cGMP-gated channels in the AFD neuron pair. Because humidity levels affect evaporative cooling, AFD may convey humidity information by reporting thermal flux. Thus, humidity sensation arises as a metamodality in C. elegans that requires the integration of parallel mechanosensory and thermosensory pathways. This hygrosensation strategy, first proposed by Thunberg more than 100 y ago, may be conserved because the underlying pathways have cellular and molecular equivalents across a wide range of species, including insects and humans.","Mechanosensation; Thermosensation","cyclic GMP; cyclic nucleotide gated channel; plastic; recombinase; article; brain nerve cell; Caenorhabditis elegans; humidity; mechanoreceptor; nonhuman; priority journal; sensation; signal transduction; temperature sense; thermoreceptor; mechanosensation; thermosensation; Acid Sensing Ion Channels; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Cyclic GMP; Epithelial Sodium Channels; Humans; Humidity; Ion Channel Gating; Ion Channels; Mechanoreceptors; Membrane Proteins; Motor Activity; Multiprotein Complexes; Sensory Receptor Cells; Starvation; Thermosensing","Pierce-Shimomura, J.T.; Center for Brain, Behavior and Evolution, Department of Neuroscience, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, United States; эл. почта: jonps@austin.utexas.edu",,"National Academy of Sciences",00278424,,PNASA,"24843133","English","Proc.

The most desirable hybrid system is the one that has the least cost, the least emission, and the most reliability. But, these objectives are in conflict with each other. In order to obtain the optimum solutions (solutions are different in the number of PV panels, the number of batteries, and the power of SOFC), a multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm [Pareto envelope-based selection algorithm (PESA)] is used. This work compares using different fuels as SOFC fuel in the hybrid system. Results have been compared to specify the more favorable fuels for SOFC economically and ecologically. Optimization is done for two categories of fuel price: international fuel prices and Iran fuel prices. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of fuel price is considered. The effect of change in SOFC power is examined to determine enough auxiliary power for this hybrid system. If the angle of panel can change monthly, PV panel productivity increases and the required SOFC power decreases, therefore the annualized cost and emission are reduced. In the present work, the effect of the monthly change of the panel angle is considered. Results show that the most appropriate fuel for SOFC in the hybrid system is natural gas. It causes low annualized cost (ANC) and low CO2 emission. If the panel angle changes monthly, the solar energy utilization efficiency increases and panels produce more power and the hybrid system provides better economical and ecological conditions. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Ecological agreement; Economical efficiency; Hybrid system; Multiobjective optimization; Photovoltaic; SOFC","Costs; Ecology; Energy utilization; Fuels; Hybrid systems; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Ecological conditions; Economical efficiency; Multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms; Optimum solution; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic panels; Productivity increase; Selection algorithm; Multiobjective optimization","Ameri, M.; Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Shahid Bahonar Univ., 7618764141 Kerman, Iran; эл. почта: ameri_mm@uk.ac.ir",,"American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)",07339402,,JLEED,,"English","J Energy Eng",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901049402

Small-scale generation is therefore likely to increase its share in the energy sector, as it ensures high degree of flexibility, quick start-up and good performance in combination with intermittent power sources such as solar or wind. One drawback of small scale generators driven by internal combustion engines is, however, low fuel conversion efficiency and high specific emissions compared to medium or high scale power units. A new control strategy for fuel injection and emissions reduction is proposed to mitigate both aspects, while ensuring flexibility in the choice of fuels for a spark ignition engine powered generator. Performance and emissions are compared for carburetor and fuel injection combined with the use of a three way catalytic converter, with the latter solution proving to be more efficient and environmentally friendly. Significant improvements in fuel conversion efficiency and reductions of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons emissions were obtained by employing the proposed setup and control strategy. Flexibility in the use of different fuel types was evaluated by performing measurements with gasoline, iso-butanol and combined use of alcohol and natural gas. Financial aspects are also covered through a brief analysis of initial capital costs and payback time in order to offer a more detailed view of both fuel systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Alternative fuels; Distributed generation; Iso-butanol; Natural gas; Regulated emissions; Spark ignition engines","Air engines; Alternative fuels; Carbon monoxide; Catalytic converters; Conversion efficiency; Distributed power generation; Emission control; Fuel injection; Fuel pumps; Internal combustion engines; Natural gas; Fuel conversion efficiencies; Fuel injection control; Performance and emissions; Regulated emissions; Small-scale generations; Small-scale generators; Three way catalytic converter; Unburned hydrocarbons; Gas emissions; alcohol; carbon monoxide; catalysis; electricity generation; electronic equipment; emission; engine; fuel; measurement method; natural gas; performance assessment","Irimescu, A.; Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Bld Mihai Viteazul 1, Romania; эл. почта: iamotors@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Pea was the model organism for Mendel's discovery of the laws of inheritance, making it the foundation of modern genetics. However, subsequent progress in pea genomics has lagged behind many other plant species, largely as a consequence of its genome size (4.45 Gbp), consisting to large part (75-97 %) of repetitive sequences and its relatively low economic significance (compare to cereals or soybean). There is a long history of genetic mapping studies in pea leading to seven linkage groups definition as well as subsequent marker/trait association. The availability of the genome sequences of three phylogenetically related legume species (Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus and Glycine max) has offered opportunities for genome wide comparison. Combination of a candidate gene and colinearity approach has allowed the identification of genes underlying agronomicaly important traits. The progress in the understanding of genes and functional association to traits in the model legume species has been accompanied by gene-based marker development in pea. This together with enhanced computational power and access to diverse germplasm collections, led to association mapping application to identify genetic variation related to desirable agronomic traits. Some of this knowledge has already been applied to marker assisted selection (MAS) programs, increasing the precision and shortening the breeding cycle. Comprehensive pea genomic resources already exist and include several types of molecular marker sets as well as both transcriptome and proteome datasets. Various available marker types have been used for assessment of genetic diversity and mapping of agronomicaly important Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL). Fast neutron and TILLING pea mutant populations are available for reverse genetics approaches, BAC libraries for positional gene cloning as well as transgenic and in vitro regeneration for proof of function or novel gene incorporation. Current genomic knowledge and technologies can facilitate the allele mining for novel traits and incorporation from wild Pisum sp. into elite domestic backgrounds. The availability of high throughput sequencing, genotyping and the-omics methodologies, these hold great promise for the development of novel, highly accurate selective breeding tools for improved pea genotypes suitable for various climates and farming systems. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

Although many of the scents themselves are synthesized in a lab, the actual mechanism of odour has long baffled chemists who attempt to model it for research. In Chemistry and the Sense of Smell, industry chemist Charles S. Sell explores the chemistry and biology surrounding the human detection and processing of odour, providing a comprehensive, single-volume guide to the totality of fragrance chemistry. The correlation between molecular structure and odour is much more complex than initially thought, and the intricacies of the mechanism by which the brain interprets scent signals leaves much to be discovered. This book provides a solid foundation of fragrance chemistry and highlights the relationship between research and industry with topics such as: The analysis and characterization of odour. The role scent plays in our lives. The design and manufacture of new fragrance ingredients. The relationship between molecular structure and odour. The mechanism of olfaction. Intellectual challenges and the future of the field. Complete with illustrations that clarify difficult concepts and the structures of the molecules under discussion, Chemistry and the Sense of Smell is an all-inclusive guide to the science of scent. For professionals in the fragrance industry or related fields, this book is one resource that should not be overlooked. © 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

This paper examines the effect of flupropanate under three grazing regimes (set, strategic and no grazing) on the amount of bare ground and the basal cover of broadleaf weeds, at several CNG-infected sites in south-eastern Australia for 5-6 years after application. Under grazing, when flupropanate was effective in reducing CNG basal cover, it was associated with large increases in bare ground and broadleaf weed basal cover. After its application, the annual average basal cover was often 15%-25% for bare ground and 10%-20% for broadleaf weeds.

The first chapter deals with unique characteristics features of lichens which facilitate their survival in extreme climates and makes them an ideal organism for ecosystem monitoring. Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites are known to protect lichens against increasing environmental stresses therefore second chapter provides insight into various chromatographic and modern spectroscopic techniques involved in separation and characterization of lichen substances. The third chapter elaborates the criteria for selection of biomonitoring species and characters of host plant that influences lichen diversity and details about different lichen species utilized for biomonitoring. One can retrieve preliminary information about the air quality based on the lichen community structure and distribution of bioindicator species as lichen communities/indicator species provides valuable information about the natural/anthropogenic induced changes in the microclimate and land-use changes due to human activity. Therefore, for identification of species, a key to genera and species provides concise information to identify the lichen species based on their morphological and anatomical characters and chemicals present. Keys provided in Chapter 4 will help the beginners to identify some common lichen species based on the distribution in different climatic zones of India. The section also provides comprehensive information about the bioindicator communities and bioindicator species from India.

Vertebrate visual pigments fall into five classes, a rod pigment that is found in rod photoreceptors that are responsible for dim-light vision and four spectral classes of cone photoreceptors that are responsible for vision in daylight and provide for the sensation of color if two or more classes of cone are present. The underlying mechanisms that determine the overall sensitivity of individual photoreceptors to different light levels and hence whether they are functional in dim or bright light however extend beyond the type of visual pigment present into the processes of phototransduction. The kinetics of phototransduction is determined by the different rod and cone isoforms that comprise many of its component processes, combined with the concentration of certain key components. The spectral tuning of visual pigment is determined by the type of chromophore present and its interaction with the opsin protein. The amino acid present at key sites within the opsin protein determines spectral tuning; these sites are limited in number and tend to be shared across different pigment classes. Other changes include the protonation of the Schiff base for short wavelength-sensitive type 1 (SWS1) pigments and the binding of chloride ions for long wavelengthsensitive (LWS) pigments. Opsin gene loss and/or duplication is common across the different vertebrate taxa, with certain classes of cone opsins absent in certain lineages. These changes can be related in many cases to differential expression during development or to evolutionary changes in lifestyle and the light environment. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.","Color vision; Photoreceptors; Phototransduction; Retina; Spectral tuning; Ultraviolet sensitivity; Visual opsins",,"Hunt, D.M.; School of Animal Biology, 35 Stirling Highway, Australia; эл. почта: david.hunt@uwa.edu.au",,"Springer US",,9781461443551; 9781461443544,,,"English","Evol. of Vis. and Non-Vis.

This book examines the challenges and opportunities we face in achieving sustainable land use in the twenty-first century. While land resources remain finite, the global population is projected to reach ten billion by the end of the century, bringing issues of ethics and fairness to center stage. Who should decide how land is used? Where does competition for land occur, and why? Moreover, accelerating globalization, increasing demand for animal protein in our diets, the need for new sources of energy, and the global scarcity of land have led to a decoupling of land use and local control, which raises issues of governance. The contributors, from a range of disciplines and countries, present new analytical perspectives and tools for understanding key issues in global land use. The chapters consider such topics as food production and land use; case studies of urbanization and agriculture in Brazil and China; telecoupling and connections to distant places; emerging institutions of land-use governance; public and private regulation of land use; uniquely urban issues of land use; and future steps to sustainability.

Concepts such as 'environmental security' and 'resource conflict' have been used to hint at these significant linkages. While there has been a good deal of scholarly work conducted that seeks to identify the ways that actors link these concepts, there has been little examination of the intersection between approaches to environmental security and gender. This book explores this intersection to provide an insight into the gendered nature of both global environmental politics and security studies. It examines how the issues of security and the environment are linked to theory and practice, and the extent to which gender informs these discussions. By adopting a feminist environmental security discourse, this book provides crucial redefinitions of key concepts and offers new insights into the ways we understand security-environment connections. Case studies evaluate if, and how, environment and security discourses are being used to understand a range of environmental issues, and how a feminist environmental security discourse contributes to our understanding of security-environment connections. This multidisciplinary volume draws on literature from the environmental sciences, security studies and sociology to highlight the complex human insecurities that often accompany environmental change. As conceptualizations of security continue to shift and broaden to include environmental issues and concerns, it is imperative that gender informs the debate. © 2015 Nicole Detraz.",,,"Detraz, N.; University of MemphisUnited States",,"Taylor and Francis",,9781315765037; 9781138789104,,,"English","Environmental Security and Gend.",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954444924

Increasingly, new media channels and formats are employed in the dissemination process, making road safety-related messages ubiquitous, and often controversial. Policy makers, educators, researchers, and the public continue to debate the utility and morality of some of the influence tactics employed in these messages, such as the use of graphic images of injury or death, stigmatization (or ""blame and shame""), and the use of ""black humor."" Guttman argues that influencing road safety requires making changes in normative and cultural conceptions of broader issues in society, yet the typical discourse on road safety tends to focus on individual attitudes and practices. The book highlights the importance of social and behavioral theory in communication campaigns on road safety, and critiques the tendency to focus on individual cognition, affect, and risk conceptions rather than on normative, structural, and cultural factors. The volume positions the discourse on road safety as a social issue, and treats road safety behavior as a social activity that directly relates to other public issues, social values, and social policy, while discussing potential uses of social media and participatory approaches. The discussion turns to the role of road safety communication campaigns as part of a democratic process of eliciting public discourse, including how contemporary society could address broader issues of risk and safety. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",,,"Guttman, N.; Department of Communication, Israel",,"Taylor and Francis",,9780203078419; 9780415806695,,,"English","Communication, Public Discourse, and Road Saf.

This book investigates preposition placement in the early and late Modern English periods (1500-1900), with a special focus on preposition stranding (The house which I live in) in opposition to pied piping (The house in which I live). Based on a large-scale analysis of precept and usage data, this study reassesses the alleged influence of late eighteenth-century normative works on language usage. It also sheds new light on the origins of the stigmatisation of preposition stranding.

Currently all countries realise that buildings are large consumers of energy during their life cycle. The United Nations initiated 'Global Green Policy'as well as 'Sustainable architecture and building initiative' that are related to the use of resources in buildings. These policies strive for goals 'zero-resource buildings' and 'building resource regulating'. Because of this, many countries have developed various building resource codes in dealing with building resource demand, thus gradually using energy-saving materials and equipment and alternative renewable green resources to coordinate with industry development. This includes actions such as mandatory design standards, green procurement policies and incentive subsidies and tax break policies. This research is directed towards existing buildings in the Kaohsiung area (over 90%). It uses planning design analysis of existing building outer shell energy-saving design transformation. By using data collection and choosing townhouses in Kaohsiung city (representative case), we use a building energy simulation in a building information model (BIM) to carry out efficiency analysis and simulation of exterior energy-saving transformation. By using simulation estimates for verification, the results integrate a building environmental efficiency model (EEM) and evaluate its life cycle cost and efficiency (LCCE).

Yet despite the environmental advantages of urban density, urban sprawl and reliance on the private car still set the pattern for most new development. Cars guzzle not only gas but also space, as massive acreage is dedicated to roadways and parking. Even more pressing, the replication of this pattern throughout the fast-developing world makes it doubtful that we will achieve the reductions in carbon emissions needed to avoid climate catastrophe. In Rail and the City, architect Roxanne Warren makes the case for compact urban development that is supported by rail transit. Calling the automobile a relic of the twentieth century, Warren envisions a release from the tyrannies of traffic congestion, petroleum dependence, and an oppressively paved environment. Technical features of rail are key to its high capacities, safety at high speeds, and compactness -- uniquely qualifying it to serve as ideal infrastructure within and between cities. Ultimately, mobility could be achieved through extensive networks of public transit, particularly rail, supplemented by buses, cycling, walking, car-sharing, and small, flexible vehicles. High-speed rail, fed by local transit, could eliminate the need for petroleum-intensive plane trips of less than 500 miles.Warren considers issues of access to transit, citing examples from Europe, Japan, and North America, and pedestrian- and transit-oriented urban design. Rail transit, she argues, is the essential infrastructure for a fluidly functioning urban society. © 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In order to counteract this circumstance, the European Commission has developed a European alternative fuels strategy. This strategy also encompasses the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In Austria, as well as in other landlocked European countries, LNG offers new market opportunities. However, there are lots of uncertainties and hurdles like no existing LNG infrastructure and very limited supply options to overcome. To make a significant contribution for the introduction of LNG as a fuel in Austria, the aim of this paper is on the one hand to identify pioneer customers to define interest and demand for LNG as a new fueling alternative and on the other hand to investigate different supply options and their economic performance. The analyses were conducted through desktop research, inquiries to LNG suppliers and transport companies as well as interviews with operators. First results of the supply analysis revealed LNG transportation costs, depending on the choice of transport mode (train, truck or inland vessel) and the reference terminal (Rotterdam or Zeebrugge). Findings of the demand analysis have highlighted that some interview partners already considered switching to LNG for very different purposes, whereby for other partners LNG is not an option. In fact, the missing LNG infrastructure and various hurdles in different supply options have been identified as the most apparent obstacle, which is impeding LNG usage. © 2014 WIT Press.","Alternative fuel; Demand; LNG; Supply chain","alternative fuel; demand analysis; European Commission; liquefied natural gas; transportation mode; Austria",,"Al-Kayiem H.H.Zubir S.S.Brebbia C.A.","WITPress",17433541,9781845648374,,,"English","WIT Trans.

Today the LNG share in global gas trading is at about 30%, in Europe at only 15.5%. Most notably LNG is used in industry and pipeline feeding. For the use of LNG as fuel, which could reduce the dependence on oil, there are currently only limited supply options for end users. The infrastructure is still in a developing stage. The aim of this work is a detailed analysis and assessment of the developments around the implementation and applications of LNG. With specific focus, the potential of LNG as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and ships is being investigated. For this purpose, extensive literature research was carried out as the first step. There is an impressive amount of work and projects that aim to break through these barriers and to implement LNG as alternative energy and fuel source. Currently in Europe there are about 40 LNG filling stations, which supply about 200 trucks and buses. Due to stringent emissions requirements, the LNG-powered ship market has grown in the last decade. About 20 ships are already in transit on the coast of Norway. For inland vessels, LNG as a fuel in Europe is still banned, but nevertheless there are currently two barges operating with a certificate of exemption between Basel and Rotterdam. The results of this paper should point to the problem areas as well as the potentials for LNG as a fuel and make a significant contribution towards further implementation steps. © 2014 WIT Press.","Alternative fuel; Energy supply; Liquefied Natural Gas; LNG","alternative fuel; energy market; energy policy; fuel consumption; gas trade; liquefied natural gas; policy implementation; Europe",,"Al-Kayiem H.H.Zubir S.S.Brebbia C.A.","WITPress",17433541,9781845648374,,,"English","WIT Trans.

Theoretically, the article critiques the dominant emphases on 'scarcity', 'state failure' and 'under-development' within discussions of environmental security, and proposes an alternative model of environment-conflict relations centring on resource abundance and globally-embedded processes of state-building and development. Empirically, it examines three claimed (or possible) linkages between water and conflict in the Sudans: over trans-boundary waters of the Nile, over the links between internal resource scarcities and civil conflict; and over the internal conflict impacts of water abundance and development. We find that there exists only limited evidence in support of the first two of these linkages, but plentiful evidence that water abundance, and state-directed processes of economic development and internal colonisation relating to water, have had violent consequences. We conclude that analysts and policymakers should pay more attention to the impacts of resource abundance, militarised state power and global political economic forces in their assessments of the potential conflict impacts of environmental and especially climate change. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Conflict; Scarcity; Sudan; Water",,"Selby, J.; Department of International Relations, University of SussexUnited Kingdom",,"Elsevier Ltd",09593780,,GECHE,,"English","Global Environ.

Petroleum fuels remain the dominant energy source, reflecting advantages such as high energy density, low cost, and market availability. The movement of people and freight makes a major contribution to economic development and social well-being, but it also negatively impacts climate change, air quality, health, social cohesion, and safety. Following a review published 20 years ago in the Annual Review of Environment and Resources (then named the Annual Review of Energy and the Environment) by Lee Schipper, we examine current trends and potential futures, revising several major global transport/energy reports. There are significant opportunities to slow travel growth and improve efficiency. Alternatives to petroleum exist but have different characteristics in terms of availability, cost, distribution, infrastructure, storage, and public acceptability. The transition to low-carbon equitable and sustainable transport will take time but can be fostered by numerous short- and medium-term strategies that would benefit energy security, health, productivity, and sustainability.

Air pollution is the introduction of chemicals, particulate matter, or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to humans or other living organisms, or cause damage to the natural environment or built environment, into the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. Stratospheric ozone depletion due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's ecosystems. Indoor air pollution and urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report Controlling and curtailing air pollution from industrial sources is essential to improv air quality. Industrial sources of air pollution include factories, electrical generation plants and incinerators. Because these sources exist in fixed locations, they are often referred to as ""point sources"" to distinguish them from emissions from ""mobile sources"" such as motor vehicles, boats and airplanes. amlai industrial area has also some point sources.The stack &amp; ambient air quality of some locations in the area has been studied in different period of time.

The aim of this study was to determine whether there was an association between outdoor concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and a daily number of hospital admissions due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in Novi Sad, Serbia among patients aged above 18. Material and Methods: The investigation was carried out during over a 3-year period (from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009) in the area of Novi Sad. The number (N = 10 469) of daily CVD (ICD-10: I00-I99) hospital admissions was collected according to patients' addresses. Daily mean levels of NO2 and SO2, measured in the ambient air of Novi Sad via a network of fixed samplers, have been used to put forward outdoor air pollution. Associations between air pollutants and hospital admissions were firstly analyzed by the use of the linear regression in a single polluted model, and then trough a single and multi-polluted adjusted generalized linear Poisson model. Results: The single polluted model (without confounding factors) indicated that there was a linear increase in the number of hospital admissions due to CVD in relation to the linear increase in concentrations of SO2 (p = 0.015; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.144-1.329, R2 = 0.005) and NO 2 (p = 0.007; 95% CI: 0.214-1.361, R2 = 0.007). However, the single and multi-polluted adjusted models revealed that only NO2 was associated with the CVD (p = 0.016, relative risk (RR) = 1.049, 95% CI: 1.009-1.091 and p = 0.022, RR = 1.047, 95% CI: 1.007-1.089, respectively). Conclusions: This study shows a significant positive association between hospital admissions due to CVD and outdoor NO2 concentrations in the area of Novi Sad, Serbia. © 2014 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.","Ambient air pollution; Cardiovascular diseases; Effects of pollutants; Exposure-outcome relation; Patient admission","air pollutants; Nitrogen Dioxide; Sulfur Dioxide; adolescent; adult; adverse effects; aged; aged, 80 and over; air pollutants; analysis; Cardiovascular Diseases; Environmental Monitoring; Hospitalization; Humans; Middle Aged; Serbia; statistics and numerical data; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Cardiovascular Diseases; Environmental Monitoring; Hospitalization; Humans; Middle Aged; Nitrogen Dioxide; Serbia; Sulfur Dioxide; Young Adult","Jevtić, M.; Center for Hygiene and Human Ecology, Futoška 121, 21000 Novi Sad, Serbia; эл. почта: marija.jevtic@uns.ac.rs",,"Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine",12321087,,IOMHE,"24549995","English","Int.

Although natural gas is used as a transportation fuel, constraints in storage, relatively low energy content (MJ/L), and delivery have limited widespread adoption. Advanced utilization of natural gas has been explored for biofuel production by microorganisms. In recent years, the aerobic bioconversion of natural gas (or primarily the methane content of natural gas) into liquid fuels (Bio-GTL) by biocatalysts (methanotrophs) has gained increasing attention as a promising alternative for drop-in biofuel production. Methanotrophic bacteria are capable of converting methane into microbial lipids, which can in turn be converted into renewable diesel via a hydrotreating process. In this paper, biodiversity, catalytic properties and key enzymes and pathways of these microbes are summarized. Bioprocess technologies are discussed based upon existing literature, including cultivation conditions, fermentation modes, bioreactor design, and lipid extraction and upgrading. This review also outlines the potential of Bio-GTL using methane as an alternative carbon source as well as the major challenges and future research needs of microbial lipid accumulation derived from methane, key performance index, and techno-economic analysis. An analysis of raw material costs suggests that methane-derived diesel fuel has the potential to be competitive with petroleum-derived diesel. © 2014 The Authors.","Bioconversion of natural gas into liquid fuels (Bio-GTL); Bioprocess optimization; Greenhouse gas; Hydrotreating process; Lipid extraction; Methanotrophic bacteria; Microbial lipids; Renewable diesel fuel; Techno-economic analysis","Bacteria; Bioconversion; Biodiesel; Biodiversity; Diesel fuels; Economic analysis; Extraction; Fuel storage; Greenhouse gases; Lipids; Liquid fuels; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Bioprocess optimization; Hydrotreating process; Lipid extraction; Methanotrophic bacteria; Microbial lipids; Renewable diesels; Techno-Economic analysis; Natural gas transportation; anthropogenic source; biofuel; biotechnology; carbon; cost-benefit analysis; fermentation; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; lipid; methane; methanogenic bacterium; molecular analysis; natural gas; oil production; oxic conditions; petroleum hydrocarbon; renewable resource; Bacteria (microorganisms); biofuel; methane; natural gas; phospholipid; bioreactor; microbiology; Proteobacteria; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Industrial Microbiology; Methane; Natural Gas; Phospholipids; Proteobacteria","Pienkos, P.T.; National Bioenergy Center, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 15013 Denver West Parkway, Golden, Colorado, 80401, United States; эл. почта: Philip.Pienkos@nrel.gov",,"Elsevier Inc.",07349750,,BIADD,"24726715","English","Biotechnol.

The ORs operate as non-selective cation channels, also conducting Ca2+ ions. The Orco protein contains a conserved putative calmodulin (CaM)-binding motif indicating a role of CaM in its function. Using Ca2+ imaging to monitor OR activity we investigated the effect of CaM inhibition on the function of OR proteins. Ca2+ responses elicited in Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons by stimulation with the synthetic OR agonist VUAA1 were reduced and prolonged by CaM inhibition with the potent antagonist W7 but not with the weak antagonist W5. A similar effect was observed for Orco proteins heterologously expressed in CHO cells when CaM was inhibited with W7, trifluoperazine or chlorpromazine, or upon overexpression of CaM-EF-hand mutants. With the Orco CaM mutant bearing a point mutation in the putative CaM site (K339N) the Ca2+ responses were akin to those obtained for wild type Orco in the presence of W7. There was no uniform effect of W7 on Ca2+ responses in CHO cells expressing complete ORs (Or22a/Orco, Or47a/Orco, Or33a/Orco, Or56a/Orco). For Or33a and Or47a we observed no significant effect of W7, while it caused a reduced response in cells expressing Or22a and a shortened response for Or56a. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Calcium imaging; Drosophila; Odorant receptor; Olfactory sensory neuron; Orco","calcium; calmodulin; cation channel; chlorpromazine; n (6 aminohexyl) 1 naphthalenesulfonamide; n (6 aminohexyl) 5 chloro 1 naphthalenesulfonamide; odorant receptor; odorant receptor 22a; odorant receptor 33a; odorant receptor 47a; odorant receptor 56a; Orco protein; trifluoperazine; unclassified drug; calmodulin; N-(4-ethylphenyl)-2-((4-ethyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)thio)acetamide; olfactory receptor; sulfonamide; thioglycolic acid derivative; triazole derivative; animal cell; article; CHO cell line; controlled study; Drosophila; nonhuman; priority journal; sensory nerve cell; agonists; amino acid sequence; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; binding site; Cricetulus; drug effects; genetics; hamster; metabolism; molecular genetics; olfactory receptor; sequence alignment; site directed mutagenesis; Hexapoda; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Binding Sites; Calcium; Calmodulin; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Cricetulus; Drosophila; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Olfactory Receptor Neurons; Receptors, Odorant; Sequence Alignment; Sulfonamides; Thioglycolates; Triazoles","Wicher, D.; Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Hans-Knöll-St. 8, D-07745 Jena, Germany; эл. почта: dwicher@ice.mpg.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",01434160,,CECAD,"24661599","English","Cell Calcium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899976146

Our analysis covers the manufacturing processes of these vehicles and their use as a city taxi in Singapore. We also consider upstream emissions from fuel and electricity production. All necessary parameters are derived from an intensive literature review and the model for calculating the life cycle emissions is presented. The influence of data uncertainties is analyzed by parameter variations within different scenarios. The calculation results are found to be quite robust: The BEV and the mild hybrid CNG vehicle similarly show very low GHG emissions within all scenarios whereas the pure CNG vehicle always ranks the worst. In an additional scenario we also assessed the influence of an improved electricity generation with lower emissions in the future. In this the results of the BEV and the range extended BEV were significantly improved compared to the previous baseline calculations. We conclude that the introduction of BEVs is an effective measure to reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector of the future. However, mild hybrid CNG vehicles seem to be a very practicable solution for mobility with less GHG emissions today and in the nearer future.

To that end, a thorough control of the air-to-fuel ratio appears to be mandatory in SI engine in order to meet the even more stringent thresholds set by the current regulations. The accuracy of the air/fuel mixture highly depends on the injection system dynamic behavior and to its coupling to the engine fluid-dynamic. Thus, a sound investigation into the mixing process can only be achieved provided that a proper analysis of the injection rail and of the injectors is carried out. The present paper carries out a numerical investigation into the fluid dynamic behavior of a commercial CNG injection system by means of a 0D-1D code. The model has been validated by comparing the experimental readings to the numerical outputs in terms of injection system pressure profiles versus time. The model has hence been applied to the prediction of the pressure waves produced by the injection event and of their effect on the actually injected fuel. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the predictive model. A general good match between the predicted values and the measured rail pressure and injected fuel mass flow rates has been observed over a wide range of engine operation conditions. Moreover, the dynamic simulations have brought out a reduced independence of the injected fuel mass on the average rail pressure level, which further reduced for increasing engine power outputs. Moreover, the results have proved that the correct simulation of the system behavior relies on the consistent characterization of the pressure regulator functioning. It is worth observing that the full fluid dynamic characterization of the rail allows for the design of optimal control strategies so as to meet the engine requirements.

Vehicles with lower tailpipe emissions are perceived as cleaner. However, does it make sense to look only to tailpipe emissions? Limiting the comparison only to these emissions denies the fact that there are emissions involved during the production of a fuel and this approach gives too much advantage to zero-tailpipe vehicles like battery electric vehicles (BEV) and fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). Would it be enough to combine fuel production and tailpipe emissions? Especially when comparing the environmental performance of alternative vehicle technologies, the emissions during production of the specific components and their appropriate end-of-life treatment processes should also be taken into account. Therefore, the complete life cycle of the vehicle should be included in order to avoid problem shifting from one life stage to another. In this article, a full life cycle assessment (LCA) of petrol, diesel, fuel cell electric (FCEV), compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), hybrid electric, battery electric (BEV), bio-diesel and bio-ethanol vehicles has been performed. The aim of the manuscript is to investigate the impact of the different vehicle technologies on the environment and to develop a range-based modeling system that enables a more robust interpretation of the LCA results for a group of vehicles. Results are shown for climate change, respiratory effects, acidification and mineral extraction damage of the different vehicle technologies. A broad range of results is obtained due to the variability within the car market. It is concluded that it is essential to take into account the influence of all the vehicle parameters on the LCA results. © 2014 by the authors.","Electric vehicles; Environmental impact; Green cars; Life cycle assessment; Sustainable mobility; Uncertainty","Climate change; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Fuel cells; Liquefied petroleum gas; Technology; Battery electric vehicles; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Environmental performance; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Sustainable mobility; Uncertainty; Life cycle","Messagie, M.; Electrotechnical Engineering and Energy Technology, Pleinlaan 2, Brussels 1050, Belgium; эл. почта: maarten.messagie@vub.ac.be",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896996290

Calcium ions are inter- and intra-cellular messengers that are involved in numerous signalling pathways. Fluctuating compartment-specific calcium ion concentrations can lead to localised and even plant-wide oscillations that can regulate downstream events. Understanding the mechanisms that give rise to these complex patterns that vary both in space and time can be challenging, even in cases for which individual components have been identified. Taking a systems biology approach, mathematical and computational techniques can be employed to produce models that recapitulate experimental observations and capture our current understanding of the system. Useful models make novel predictions that can be investigated and falsified experimentally.

Consequently, hybridization and polyploidization have been regarded as the most important driving forces to promote plant evolution and formation of species. Moreover, heterosis and polyploidization have been widely used in agriculture, and bring enormous economic and social value. It suggests that it is very important and valuable to explore the nature basis of heterosis and polyploidization in plants which have attracted much attention.

Trip-level GHG emissions are estimated by combining data sources (e.g., origin-destination surveys, vehicle fleet characteristics, transit ridership data) and by using modeling tools (traffic assignment and GHG models) developed for Montreal, Quebec, Canada. A simultaneous equation model framework is implemented to investigate links between urban form, transit supply, sociodemographics, and travel GHGs, taking into account the issue of residential self-selection. The potential impacts of land use and transit supply strategies with emerging green technology scenarios are then compared with each other. Findings are consistent with the literature; built environment attributes are statistically significant (10% increase in density, transit accessibility, and land use mix results in 3.5%, 5.8%, and 2.5% GHG reductions, respectively), and the number of workers and retirees make important contributions to GHG emissions at the household level (102% increase from adding one worker and 51% decrease from adding one retiree). Also, if the current transit fleet were replaced with electric trains and hybrid buses, transit GHGs would decrease by 32%. If current trends persist in the private motor vehicle fleet, continued improvements in car fuel economy are estimated to reduce car GHGs 7% by 2020.

They contribute significantly to the emissions of greenhouse gas and air pollutants. Policy makers consider the introduction of new emissions standard vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles in bus and taxi fleets as an attractive measure for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gas and air pollutants. It is important to understand the environmental benefits and economic challenges involved in fleet conversion. However, few studies have been conducted, especially in developing countries. This study analyzes the cost effectiveness and environmental benefits of various vehicles by employing a case study in Shenyang, China. The results showed that CNG bus has the best overall economic and environmental performances, while diesel car is one possible choice for taxi selection when considering the current technology level.

These cytosolic Ca2+ increases result from Ca2+ influx through Ca2+-permeable channels in the plasma membrane and Ca2+ release from intracellular organelles in guard cells. However, the genes encoding defined plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channel activity remain unknown in guard cells and, with some exceptions, largely unknown in higher plant cells. Here, we report the identification of two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cation channel genes, CNGC5 and CNGC6, that are highly expressed in guard cells. Cytosolic application of cyclic GMP (cGMP) and extracellularly applied membrane-permeable 8-Bromoguanosine 39,59-cyclic monophosphate-cGMP both activated hyperpolarization-induced inward-conducting currents in wild-type guard cells using Mg2+ as the main charge carrier. The cGMP-activated currents were strongly blocked by lanthanum and gadolinium and also conducted Ba2+, Ca2+, and Na+ ions. cngc5 cngc6 double mutant guard cells exhibited dramatically impaired cGMP-activated currents. In contrast, mutations in CNGC1, CNGC2, and CNGC20 did not disrupt these cGMP-activated currents. The yellow fluorescent protein-CNGC5 and yellow fluorescent protein-CNGC6 proteins localize in the cell periphery. Cyclic AMP activated modest inward currents in both wild-type and cngc5cngc6 mutant guard cells. Moreover, cngc5 cngc6 double mutant guard cells exhibited functional abscisic acid (ABA)-activated hyperpolarization-dependent Ca2+-permeable cation channel currents, intact ABA-induced stomatal closing responses, and whole-plant stomatal conductance responses to darkness and changes in CO2 concentration. Furthermore, cGMP-activated currents remained intact in the growth controlled by abscisic acid2 and abscisic acid insensitive1 mutants. This research demonstrates that the CNGC5 and CNGC6 genes encode unique cGMP-activated nonselective Ca2+-permeable cation channels in the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis guard cells. © 2013 American Society of Plant Biologists.

However, little is known regarding how cytosine methylation changes in polyploids development, especially in polyploid trees. In this study, we investigated drifting changes of DNA methylation status at 5′-CCGG sites in the apical bud, young and mature leaf tissues of triploid black poplar (Populus. euramericana) with methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) and assessed the expression of multiple DNA methyltransferases (MTases) and DNA demethylase during different developmental stages. MSAP analysis detected methylation levels at CG and CNG sites of diploid tissues reduced during development from bud to leaves, while for the triploid, methylation at CNG sites increased during development, but levels of methylation at CG sites first decreased in young leaves before increasing in mature leaves. MTase genes related to CG or CNG methylation were respectively preferential in different triploid tissues with high CG or CNG methylation levels. High expression of DNA demethylase was observed in tissue with high demethylation trends. These finding suggest CG and CNG methylation and their related enzymes are involved with different biological functions and networks of gene regulation in different developmental stages of triploid. © 2012 Society for Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology.","Methylation; Methyltransferase; Populus; triploid",,"Chen, C.

The ancestral opsin originated more than 700Mya (million years ago) and duplicated to form three branches before cnidarians diverged from our own lineage. During chordate evolution, ciliary opsins (C-opsins) underwent multiple stages of improvement, giving rise to the 'bleaching' opsins that characterise cones and rods. Prior to the '2. R' rounds of whole genome duplication near the base of the vertebrate lineage, 'cone' photoreceptors already existed; they possessed a transduction cascade essentially the same as in modern cones, along with two classes of opsin: SWS and LWS (short- and long-wave-sensitive). These cones appear to have made synaptic contact directly onto ganglion cells, in a two-layered retina that resembled the pineal organ of extant non-mammalian vertebrates. Interestingly, those ganglion cells appear to be descendants of microvillar photoreceptor cells. No lens was associated with this two-layered retina, and it is likely to have mediated circadian timing rather than spatial vision. Subsequently, retinal bipolar cells evolved, as variants of ciliary photoreceptors, and greatly increased the computational power of the retina. With the advent of a lens and extraocular muscles, spatial imaging information became available for central processing, and gave rise to vision in vertebrates more than 500Mya. The '2. R' genome duplications permitted the refinement of cascade components suitable for both rods and cones, and also led to the emergence of five visual opsins. The exact timing of the emergence of 'true rods' is not yet clear, but it may not have occurred until after the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates. © 2013 The Author.","Evolution; Opsins; Photoreceptors; Phototransduction; Retina","cone opsin; cyclic nucleotide gated channel; opsin; phosphodiesterase VI; retina S antigen; rhodopsin; scotopsin; Branchiostoma; cell differentiation; cyclostome; extraocular muscle; eye development; genome; hagfish; human; karyotype; light adaptation; nonhuman; Petromyzon; photopic vision; photoreceptor; photoreceptor cell; photosensitivity; phototransduction; phylogeny; pineal body; priority journal; retina; retina bipolar ganglion cell; retina cone; retina rod; review; signal noise ratio; synaptic transmission; thermostability; Urochordata; vertebrate; vision; Evolution; Opsins; Photoreceptors; Phototransduction; Retina; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Light Signal Transduction; Opsins; Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate; Phylogeny; Retina","Lamb, T.D.; Department of Neuroscience and ARC Centre of Excellence in Vision Science, , Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; эл. почта: Trevor.Lamb@anu.edu.au",,,13509462,,PRTRE,"23792002","English","Prog.

Vulnerability ""hotspots"" highlight the spatial intersection of socio-economic justice concerns, particularly in terms of vulnerability to increased cyclone activity. We discuss vulnerabilities of Sorsogon City and its citizens to climate change and measures undertaken through various social, environmental and technical systems and interventions to increase resilience. The paper also attempts to unpick the relationship between the neat, concise reported city and the complexities of urban life using the Sorsogon experiment to consider the limitations of such approaches to governing climate change. We group these under four headings: social simplification in the absence of data; over-governance (and under-representation); quick wins versus strategic investment; and stretching the ecological and vulnerability footprints of the city.

In order to study the influence of the carbon fibre amount on the composite thermal decomposition, the cone calorimeter external heat flux was varied up to 75 kW m-2. Thus, main parameters of the thermal decomposition of two different composites determined were: mass loss, mass loss rate, ignition time, thermal response parameter, ignition temperature, critical heat flux, thermal inertia and heat of gasification. As a result, when carbon fibre fraction decreases from 59 to 56 vol%, an increase of the thermal parameters was observed: 14-18 kW m-2 for critical heat flux, 370-435 kW s1/2 m-2 for thermal response parameter, 2.25-5.07 kW2 s m-4 K-2 for thermal inertia and 16-18 kJ g-1 for gasification heat. By analysing the mass loss rate evolutions, a four phases thermal decomposition mechanism is proposed. In the first phase, epoxy resin is cracked to form low molecular weight gaseous species and epoxy-derived compounds. For two next phases, the combustion of epoxy resin and liquor monomer solvent is observed that induces the formation of carbon char. In the last phase, char oxidation and carbon fibre decomposition are identified. Further, during the composite decomposition process, thermal behaviour of solid matrix is changed from a thermally thick material to a thermally thin one when sample is exposed at high external heat flux above 20 kW m-2. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

However, DNA methylation also varies with tissue, developmental stage, and environmental factors. Eliminating these factors, we analyzed the levels and patterns, diversity and structure of genomic methylcytosine in the xylem of nine natural populations of Chinese white poplar.Principal Findings:On average, the relative total methylation and non-methylation levels were approximately 26.567% and 42.708% (P&lt;0.001), respectively. Also, the relative CNG methylation level was higher than the relative CG methylation level. The relative methylation/non-methylation levels were significantly different among the nine natural populations. Epigenetic diversity ranged from 0.811 (Gansu) to 1.211 (Shaanxi), and the coefficients of epigenetic differentiation (GST = 0.159) were assessed by Shannon's diversity index. Co-inertia analysis indicated that methylation-sensitive polymorphism (MSP) and genomic methylation pattern (CG-CNG) profiles gave similar distributions. Using a between-group eigen analysis, we found that the Hebei and Shanxi populations were independent of each other, but the Henan population intersected with the other populations, to some degree.Conclusions:Genome methylation in Populus tomentosa presented tissue-specific characteristics and the relative 5′-CCGG methylation level was higher in xylem than in leaves. Meanwhile, the genome methylation in the xylem shows great epigenetic variation and could be fixed and inherited though mitosis. Compared to genetic structure, data suggest that epigenetic and genetic variation do not completely match. © 2013 Ma et al.",,"article; China; DNA methylation; DNA polymorphism; epigenetics; genetic variability; methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism; natural population; nonhuman; plant leaf; population genetic structure; Populus; Populus tomentosa; species distribution; xylem; Base Sequence; China; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Genetic Variation; Genome, Plant; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Genetic; Populus; Principal Component Analysis","Zhang, D.; National Engineering Laboratory for Tree Breeding, , Beijing, China; эл. почта: DeqiangZhang@bjfu.edu.cn",,,19326203,,,"23704963","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877999089

A detailed analysis of the electricity mix was performed, based on the contribution of each type of primary energy source and their variation along a year. Three mixes were considered, with different life cycle GHG intensity: one mainly based in fossil sources, a second one with a large contribution from nuclear and a third one with a significant share of renewable energy sources. The conventional vehicle technology is represented by gasoline and diesel International Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs), while the electric technology is represented by Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). Real world tests were performed for representative compact and sub-compact EVs. The use profile of the vehicle was based on data acquired by a real time data acquisition system installed in the vehicles. The results show that a mix with a large contribution from Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) does not always translate directly into low GHG emissions for EVs due to the high variability of these sources. The driving profile under different scenarios was also analyzed, showing that an aggressive style can increase the energy consumption by 47%. The tests also showed that the use of climate control can increase the energy consumption between 24 and 60%. Compared with other technologies, EVs can be more sustainable from an environmental and economic perspective; however, three main factors are required: improvement of battery technology, an eco-driving attitude and an environmental friendly electricity mix. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery electric vehicles; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life-cycle assessment; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Total costs of ownership; Well-to-wheel balances","Battery electric vehicles; Life-cycle assessments; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Total costs of ownership; Well-to-wheel; Electric vehicles; Electricity; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Technology; Environmental technology","Faria, R.; Institute of Systems and Robotics, , 3030-290 Coimbra, Portugal; эл. почта: rfaria@isr.uc.pt",,,13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876493122

The fuzzy logic modeling approach enables the treatment of the vagueness associated with some of the relevant data. Performance Indices (PIs) are computed for each system using a number of performance measures. The PIs illustrate the aggregated performance of each system as well as the interactions among them. The proposed methodology also enables the estimation of a Composite Sustainability Index to summarize the aggregated performance of the overall SOS.

It appears as the most promising alternative to fossil fuels. To make hydrogen economy sustainable, it is indispensable to use renewable resources instead of fossil fuels for hydrogen production. In particular, biological conversion of water or biodegradable organic wastes into hydrogen is an environmentally friendly and efficient way of hydrogen production. Among the various biological processes known to produce biohydrogen, dark fermentation process has the dual advantages of gaseous energy generation and treatment of organic wastes. However, commercialization of the process depends on advances in bioprocess design and optimization along with an understanding of the nature of biohydrogen producing microbial communities and their improvement.

The various environmental indicators viz., ambient air quality, aerosol concentration, ambient noise level and urban green space were analysed in a spatio-temporal framework by employing geoinformatics. The ambient air quality measurement indicates a high concentration of Suspended Particulate Matter (&gt;300 μ g/m3) and Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (&gt;200 μ g/m3), as well as low level concentrations of sulphur dioxide (&lt;60 μ g/m3) and nitrogen dioxide (&lt;60 μ g/m3) in Ranchi Township. The concentration of ambient air pollutants was significantly higher in Ranchi as compared to other major urban centres of Jharkhand. The spatial distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) indicated variation with high concentrations at transportation junctions (0.30-0.35% at 340 nm) and road junctions (&gt;0.30% at 340 nm), and low concentrations (&lt;0.22% at 340 nm) at planned residential areas. The AOD concentration in Ranchi was lower (&lt;0.35% at 340 nm) compared to the Patratu coal mining-cum-industrial region (&gt;0.8% at 340 nm). The majority of the locations in Ranchi exhibited ambient noise levels above the prescribed limits with an increasing trend from 2005 to 2010. The core urban area was the noisier one (&gt;65 dB(A)) when compared to the peripheral areas in the city. The spatial assessment of urban green space derived from WorldView-II satellite data indicated the existence of adequate green spaces (12.7%) within Ranchi Township, although urban cores are largely devoid of green space due to dense built-up land. The study exhibited that vegetation significantly contributes in noise attenuation and a reduction in aerosol concentration. © 2013 Copyright The Institute of Urban Sciences.","aerosol optical depth; ambient air pollution; ambient noise pollution; GIS; urban green space; WorldView-II",,"Pandey, A.

For this purpose, we analyzed the phenotypic and genetic diversity of a large collection of tomato accessions including 44 heirloom and vintage cultivars (Solanum lycopersicum), 127 S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme (cherry tomato) and 17 Solanum pimpinellifolium accessions. The accessions were genotyped using a SNPlex™ assay of 192 SNPs, among which 121 were informative for subsequent analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) of pairwise loci and population structure were analyzed, and the association analysis between SNP genotypes and ten fruit quality traits was performed using a mixed linear model. High level of LD was found in the collection at the whole genome level. It was lower when considering only the 127 S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme accessions. Genetic structure analysis showed that the population was structured into two main groups, corresponding to cultivated and wild types and many intermediates. The number of associations detected per trait varied, according to the way the structure was taken into account, with 0-41 associations detected per trait in the whole collection and a maximum of four associations in the S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme accessions. A total of 40 associations (30 %) were co-localized with previously identified quantitative trait loci.

Centering on a long-term study of Enron and Shell's Cuiabá pipeline, From Enron to Evo traces the struggles of Bolivia's Indigenous peoples for self-determination over their lives and territories. In his analysis of their response to this encroaching development, author Derrick Hindery also sheds light on surprising similarities between neoliberal reform and the policies of the nation's first Indigenous president, Evo Morales. Drawing upon extensive interviews and document analysis, Hindery argues that many of the structural conditions created by neoliberal policies-including partial privatization of the oil and gas sector-still persist under Morales. Tactics employed by both Morales and his neoliberal predecessors utilize the rhetoric of environmental protection and Indigenous rights to justify oil, gas, mining, and road development in Indigenous territories and sensitive ecoregions. Indigenous peoples, while mindful of gains made during Morales's tenure, are increasingly dissatisfied with the administration's development model, particularly when it infringes upon their right to self-determination. From Enron to Evo demonstrates their dynamic and pragmatic strategies to cope with development and adversity, while also advancing their own aims. Offering a critique of both free-market piracy and the dilemmas of resource nationalism, this is a groundbreaking book for scholars, policy-makers, and advocates concerned with Indigenous politics, social movements, environmental justice, and resistance in an era of expanding resource development. © 2013 The Arizona Board of Regents.

Cheap oil, sound policies and strong government combined to produce the Singapore economic miracle in its first 50 years of self-rule/independence. With the end of cheap oil, how will Singapore fare and what is the relevance of its model of development for other countries?Singapore’s successful launch coincided with a golden period of cheap energy, and a pro-globalization and free trade environment. These three elements are now under threat from rising energy prices and the global financial crisis which started in 2007 that will leave a lasting impact on the world's political and economic landscape.If the Singapore model is reaching or has reached its peak, what could take its place? This book poses questions for not just for Singapore planners, but also for anyone interested in modern economics and trade beyond the current era. The book also looks into the numerous subsectors within Singapore’s broad energy sector and examines the energy sector’s links with the other pillars of its economy: trade, financial, offshore/marine operations, manufacturing and transportation. It considers possible threats and challenges: Singapore’s rising energy intensity, its vulnerability to energy supply cut-offs, the likely impact of peak oil, terrorism and environmental/climate issues. It also looks at China’s growing investment and role in Singapore’s oil and gas industry.

This was not accomplished through meaningful reform of a otoriously weak environmental law regime. Rather, Chinese authorities turned to cadre evaluation - the system for top-down bureaucratic personnel assessments - to set high-priority, quantitative environmental targets designed to mobilize governors, mayors, and stateowned enterprise leaders in every corner of China's massive bureaucracy. While conventional analysis has primarily viewed this effort through the lens of environmental protection, this Article argues that ""environmental cadre evaluation"" is better understood as something more fundamental. Chinese authorities have embraced environmental cadre evaluation as a tool for limiting risks to the party-state's hold on power, using environmental protection in an unexpected way to deliver economic growth and social stability. Environmental objectives have been elevated, but primarily to the extent they support these other values as well. But implementation problems inherent to this top-down approach abound. Local agents falsify information and shut down pollution control equipment. Closed factories are secretly reopened. These problems create an imperative for reform. Of the initiatives already under way, governance reforms that strengthen public supervision have particular advantages for resolving institutional pathologies that limit the effectiveness of China's environmental efforts. By examining why and how Chinese leaders have elevated environmental priorities through the cadre evaluation system, this Article seeks to offer insight into a number of broader ongoing debates - about environmental regulation in developing countries, accountability and regime survival in authoritarian states, and legal development in China.",,"accountability; bureaucracy; developing world; economic growth; environmental legislation; environmental protection; pollution control; reform process; sustainable development; China","Wang, A.L.; UCLA School of LawUnited States",,"Harvard University",01478257,,,,"English","Harv.

A lean burn Mercedes 906 LAG engine has been optimized properly calibrating ECU engine maps regarding both ignition advance and air to fuel ratio (AFR). It was therefore possible to correct ignition advance to take into account the faster combustion speed given by the hydrogen content of the fuel mixture. Equivalence ratio (Lambda) has instead been modified in order to minimize the NOx emissions. All the tests were performed on a steady engine test-bed focusing the attention on the most important parts of the engine maps. The target of the activity was the reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, still catching targets on pollutant emissions to getting the homologation of the engine in the same environmental category of the original one. Experimental results showed a reduction of CO2 variable with the ignition advance: decreasing the ignition advance timing the advantages are reduced. A reduction of CO2 of about 9% can be observed, for the same overall levels of pollutant emissions. After the calibration procedure the engine has been object of formal EU homologation and is running on a city bus since the start of 2013.

Fossil fuels produced from crude oil by conventional technology are being increasingly replaced by alternative fuels. It is caused by new technologies that allow combustion of such fuels and, at the same time, provide economically more efficient operation of cars. From the perspective of ecology, they are also of great importance when it comes to meeting the strict emission standards of the European Union. The experiment compares two types of alternative propulsion with LPG and CNG at selected makes of Fiat cars with 1.4 litre engines. These engines can also utilize conventional fuels - petrol and are mass-produced directly from the factory. The measurements themselves were carried out during predetermined driving cycles such as urban, extra-urban and highway. All the three categories of measurements were carried out under normal driving conditions in a standard manner in compliance with all traffic regulations. Based on all measurements obtained from both engines with LPG and CNG propulsion, we found that the car with the LPG engine became economically more advantageous. The benefit was found in expenses return with this system as well as in measured consumption, prices and availability of filling stations. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Alternative fuel; CNG; Combustion system; Exhaust gas; Fuel consumption; LPG","Alternative fuels; Engines; Exhaust gases; Fuel consumption; Liquefied petroleum gas; Propulsion; Quality assurance; Regulatory compliance; CNG; Combustion systems; Conventional fuel; Emission standard; European union; Normal driving; Three categories; Traffic regulations; Automobile engines",,,"Trans Tech Publications Ltd",10226680,9783037858356,,,"English","Adv.

Compared to traditional electricity generation technologies that use combustion processes to convert fuel into heat, and then into mechanical energy, fuel cells convert the hydrogen and oxygen chemical energy into electrical energy, without intermediate conversion processes, and with higher efficiency. In order to make the fuel cells an achievable and useful technology, it is firstly necessary to develop an economic and efficient way for hydrogen production. Molecular hydrogen is always found combined with other chemical compounds in nature, so it must be isolated. In this paper, the technical, economical and ecological aspects of hydrogen production by biogas steam reforming are presented. The economic feasibility calculation was performed to evaluate how interesting the process is by analyzing the investment, operation and maintenance costs of the biogas steam reformer and the hydrogen production cost achieved the value of 0.27 US$/kWh with a payback period of 8 years. An ecological efficiency of 94.95%, which is a good ecological value, was obtained.

They can either stay away from noxious stimuli (defined as avoidance), requiring the detection of remote warning cues, or run away upon exposure to noxious stimuli (defined as escape). Here we combine behavioural quantitative analyses, simulations and genetics to determine how Caenorhabditis elegans minimizes exposure to noxious heat when navigating in thermogradients. We find that worms use both escape and avoidance strategies, each involving the modulation of multiple parameters like speed and the frequency of steering and withdrawal behaviours. As some behavioural parameters promote escape while impairing avoidance, and vice versa, worms need to dynamically tune those parameters according to temperature. Furthermore, selectively disrupting avoidance or escape, through mutations affecting neuropeptide or TRPV channel signalling, increases exposure to heat. We conclude that dynamically switching between avoidance and escape regimes along the innocuous-noxious temperature continuum efficiently minimizes exposure to noxious heat. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Using the new bus rapid transit and light rail lines in Los Angeles, near-term and long-term life-cycle impact assessments are developed, including consideration of reduced automobile travel. Energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants are assessed, as well the potential for smog and respiratory impacts. Results show that life-cycle infrastructure, vehicle, and energy production components significantly increase the footprint of each mode (by 48-100% for energy and greenhouse gases, and up to 6200% for environmental impacts), and emerging technologies and renewable electricity standards will significantly reduce impacts. Life-cycle results are identified as either local (in Los Angeles) or remote, and show how the decision to build and operate a transit system in a city produces environmental impacts far outside of geopolitical boundaries. Ensuring shifts of between 20-30% of transit riders from automobiles will result in passenger transportation greenhouse gas reductions for the city, and the larger the shift, the quicker the payback, which should be considered for time-specific environmental goals. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","greenhouse gas emissions; life cycle assessment; transportation; urban","Automobiles; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Light rail transit; Mass transportation; Railroad transportation; Supply chains; Transportation; Urban transportation; Greenhouse gas reductions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle environmental impact; Lifecycle impact assessment; Passenger transportation; Public transportation systems; Renewable electricity; urban; Life cycle; automobile; bus transport; emission control; energy use; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; light rail system; public transport; renewable resource; smog; sustainability; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; transportation policy; urban area; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States","Chester, M.; Civil, Environmental and Sustainability Engineering, School of Sustainability, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 86287-5306, United States; эл. почта: mchester@asu.edu",,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17489326,,,,"English","Environ.Res.Lett.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876166714

Thought, the available information's in the trade literature for a complete analyse of alternative fuel diesel engine performances are insufficient. This happens also because of the operating and design particularities of the diesel engines used for experimental researches. In the paper the authors show the results of an theoretically and experimental investigations achieved on a 1.5 L common rail diesel engine dual fuelled with LPG and diesel fuel by diesel-gas method. The diesel-gas method is simple and can be applied with minimal modifications also for the engines in use. Is very difficult to use only LPG at the diesel engine because it has an auto ignition high endurance (CN = -2 to -3), different fuelling methods being use. By diesel-gas method the LPG is injected in the inlet manifold and forms with the air a homogeneous mixture, ignited by a diesel fuel pilot, the combustion being developed thru the homogeneous mixture from the combustion chamber. The general objective of this paper is the reduction of the diesel engine pollutant emissions by LPG use, without affecting the energetically performances. The specific objectives of this research are the establishment of the optimal LPG cycle dose and setup of the diesel engine optimal adjustments for all engine operating regimes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Alternative fuel; Diesel engine; LPG; Smoke","After-treatment; Auto-ignition; Common rail diesel engines; Diesel engine performance; Experimental investigations; Experimental research; Fuelling method; Homogeneous mixtures; Operating regimes; Performance improvements; Pollutant emission; Pollution level; Alternative fuels; Combustion chambers; Diesel fuels; Dual fuel engines; Ethanol; Fueling; Liquefied petroleum gas; Methanol; Optimization; Smoke; Diesel engines","Negurescu, N.; Department of Thermotechnics, Engines, Thermal Equipments and Refrigeration Installations, , Bucharest, Romania; эл. почта: nnegurescu@yahoo.com",,,18761100,9783642337765,,,"English","Lect.

Diversification of the road transport fuels will be a key attribute for road transport in the coming years. Biogas is one of alternative renewable fuels. Actually in Poland biogas is used for generating electricity and heat. In some countries (for example in Sweden), upgraded biogas to natural gas quality (biomethane) is used as a vehicle fuel too. In this chapter estimated biogas production potential in Baltic See Region countries: Germany, Poland and Sweden. It is one of the purposes of European Project Baltic Biogas Bus, realized presently. Methodology: Authors of the paper discussed ecological results of biogas (biomethane) application for fuelling city buses. Comparative studies of exhaust emissions from city buses powered by diesel and CNG engine were carried out. The study was conducted under real traffic conditions in southern Polish city Rzeszow. Due to the lack in-service city buses with emission level Euro V in Rzeszow, comparative studies of this type of city buses powered by diesel and CNG engine was conducted in SORT I test. Determined mean values of road emissions in g/km for the city buses operated in Rzeszow. Estimated value of the total road emissions in the case that would be replaced half the fleet of city buses (40 CNG buses and about 35 % of the diesel engine powered buses, meet Euro III emission standard) by the CNG-powered (biomethane) city buses, complying with Euro V (EEV) emission standard. Results: It was found, inter alia, that the above-mentioned exchange half the fleet of city buses in Rzeszow for CNG-powered buses that meet Euro V (EEV) emission standard, reduced by about 10 %, first of all, the total CO 2 emissions. The reason is to use during test SORT I the bus with engine of small displacement (downsizing). Also significantly reduced the total emission of CO and NOx (54 %) and (44 %), while THC emissions increased (70 %). Road PM emission is, as is the case in vehicles powered by CNG (biomethane), very small. The use of biomethane instead of CNG, as a fully renewable energy source, will reduce CO2 emissions compared to diesel fuel supply very significantly, taking into account the emission from the well to the wheel. The paper presents the estimated potential of biogas in Baltic See Region countries: Germany, Poland and Sweden, too. Limitations of this study: A limitation of the study was, inter alia, lack possibilities of research in real traffic conditions in Rzeszow, exhaust pollutant emissions from city buses with the Euro V level of emissions. These buses are not operated here. The lack Portable Particulate Measurement Device (PPMD) also prevented a more accurate measurement of particulate emissions during tests city buses in Rzeszow. What does the paper offer that is new in the field in comparison to other works of the author: Comparative works discussed in this chapter as well as estimates of biogas potential production in above-mentioned the Baltic Sea Region countries, the authors earlier have not conducted. Conclusion: The new transport White Paper recommends an ambitions target of 60 % reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from transport up to 2050 in comparison to 1990. In this publication is forecasted that biomethane will be alternative road transport fuel for passenger/light duty cars, heavy duty (city) vehicles and heavy duty (long distance) vehicles in short term period (2020), mid term period (2030) and long term period (2050-only for passenger/light duty cars and heavy duty (city) vehicles). Prospect of application of biogas (biomethane) as a city fuel buses is significant. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Alternative fuels; Biogas; Biomethane; City bus transport; Ecology","Accurate measurement; Baltic sea; Biogas production; Biomethane; City bus; CNG engine; CO and NO; Comparative studies; Emission level; Emission standard; European project; Exhaust emission; Exhaust pollutants; Heavy duty; In-vehicle; Key attributes; Long-term period; Mean values; Measurement device; PM emissions; Potential production; Real traffic conditions; Renewable energy source; Renewable fuels; Road transports; Short term; Small displacement; Total emissions; White papers; Alternative fuels; Automobile engines; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Ecology; Fleet operations; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Roads and streets; Transportation; Vehicles; Buses","Gis, W.; Motor Transport Institute, Poznan, Poland; эл. почта: wojciechgis@its.waw.pl",,,18761100,9783642337765,,,"English","Lect.

With respect to urbanization, the article suggests that there is a role for economic instruments in reducing air pollution related to increasing urbanization. With respect to forest cover, it notes that whereas overall forest cover has marginally increased in India, in the bulk of forests, which are moderately dense, there is a decline. The article then asks if it is reasonable to expect forest dependence to decrease as India grows and rural wealth increases. From a broader perspective, it argues that there exist crucial environmental thresholds to India's growth strategy.

As a foundational step towards deciphering the interspecific genome structures, a reference whole genome sequence was produced by the International Citrus Genome Consortium from a haploid derived from Clementine mandarin. The availability of a saturated genetic map of Clementine was identified as an essential prerequisite to assist the whole genome sequence assembly. Clementine is believed to be a 'Mediterranean' mandarin × sweet orange hybrid, and sweet orange likely arose from interspecific hybridizations between mandarin and pummelo gene pools. The primary goals of the present study were to establish a Clementine reference map using codominant markers, and to perform comparative mapping of pummelo, sweet orange, and Clementine.Results: Five parental genetic maps were established from three segregating populations, which were genotyped with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) and Insertion-Deletion (Indel) markers. An initial medium density reference map (961 markers for 1084.1 cM) of the Clementine was established by combining male and female Clementine segregation data. This Clementine map was compared with two pummelo maps and a sweet orange map. The linear order of markers was highly conserved in the different species. However, significant differences in map size were observed, which suggests a variation in the recombination rates. Skewed segregations were much higher in the male than female Clementine mapping data. The mapping data confirmed that Clementine arose from hybridization between 'Mediterranean' mandarin and sweet orange. The results identified nine recombination break points for the sweet orange gamete that contributed to the Clementine genome.Conclusions: A reference genetic map of citrus, used to facilitate the chromosome assembly of the first citrus reference genome sequence, was established. The high conservation of marker order observed at the interspecific level should allow reasonable inferences of most citrus genome sequences by mapping next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in the reference genome sequence. The genome of the haploid Clementine used to establish the citrus reference genome sequence appears to have been inherited primarily from the 'Mediterranean' mandarin. The high frequency of skewed allelic segregations in the male Clementine data underline the probable extent of deviation from Mendelian segregation for characters controlled by heterozygous loci in male parents. © 2012 Ollitrault et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","C. clementina; C. maxima; C. sinensis; Genetic maps; Indels; SNPs; SSRs","article; clementine; controlled study; gamete; gene deletion; gene insertion; gene mapping; genetic conservation; genetic marker; genetic recombination; genetic variability; genotype; molecular evolution; nonhuman; plant genetics; plant genome; population genetics; pummelo; sex difference; simple sequence repeat; single nucleotide polymorphism; sweet orange; Breeding; Chromosome Mapping; Citrus; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Markers; Genotype; Haplotypes; Hybridization, Genetic; Lod Score; Microsatellite Repeats; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Species Specificity; Synteny; Citrus; Citrus clementina; Citrus maxima; Citrus reticulata; Citrus sinensis","Ollitrault, P.; CIRAD, , F-34398 Montpellier, France; эл. почта: patrick.ollitrault@cirad.fr",,,14712164,,BGMEE,"23126659","English","BMC Genomics",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872480739

The sensations of small and large changes in temperature in most organisms have been studied separately in the context of thermotaxis and nociception, respectively. Here we use the nematode C. elegans to address the neurogenetic basis of responses to thermal stimuli over a broad range of intensities.Results: C. elegans responds to aversive temperature by eliciting a stereotypical behavioral sequence. Upon sensation of the noxious stimulus, it moves backwards, turns and resumes forward movement in a new direction. In order to study the response of C. elegans to a broad range of noxious thermal stimuli, we developed a novel assay that allows simultaneous characterization of multiple aspects of escape behavior elicited by thermal pulses of increasing amplitudes. We exposed the laboratory strain N2, as well as 47 strains with defects in various aspects of nervous system function, to thermal pulses ranging from ΔT = 0.4°C to 9.1°C and recorded the resulting behavioral profiles.Conclusions: Through analysis of the multidimensional behavioral profiles, we found that the combinations of molecules shaping avoidance responses to a given thermal pulse are unique. At different intensities of aversive thermal stimuli, these distinct combinations of molecules converge onto qualitatively similar stereotyped behavioral sequences. © 2012 Ghosh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","dimensionality reduction; ethology; Nociception; thermal sensation","Caenorhabditis elegans; agents interacting with transmitter, hormone or drug receptors; Caenorhabditis elegans protein; glutamic acid derivative; neuropeptide; potassium channel; animal; animal behavior; article; avoidance behavior; Caenorhabditis elegans; cluster analysis; escape behavior; heat; metabolism; movement (physiology); phenotype; physiology; principal component analysis; stimulation; synaptic transmission; temperature sense; Animals; Avoidance Learning; Behavior, Animal; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Cluster Analysis; Escape Reaction; Glutamates; Hot Temperature; Movement; Neuropeptides; Neurotransmitter Agents; Phenotype; Physical Stimulation; Potassium Channels; Principal Component Analysis; Synaptic Transmission; Thermosensing","Ryu, W.S.; Department of Physics, St George Street, Toronto, Canada; эл. почта: wryu@physics.utoronto.ca",,,17417007,,,"23114012","English","BMC Biol.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868217672

When transcribed, the toxic RNA CUG repeats sequester RNA binding proteins, which leads to disease symptoms. The expanded CUG repeats can adopt a double-stranded structure, and targeting this helix is a therapeutic strategy for DM1. To improve our understanding of the 5′CUG/3′GUC motif and how it may interact with proteins and small molecules, we designed a short CUG helix attached to a GAAA tetraloop/receptor to facilitate crystal packing. Here we report the highest-resolution structure (1.95 Å) to date of a GAAA tetraloop/receptor and the CUG helix it was used to crystallize. Within the CUG helix, we identify two different forms of noncanonical U-U pairs and reconfirm that CUG repeats are essentially A-form.

The increasing number of passenger cars, especially during the last decade, resulted in composite traffic problems with serious consequences on emissions and fuel consumption. However, the present work aims to clear the effect of different operating parameters of the vehicle on their emission characteristics. The on-road emission test procedure was carried out on a newly registered gasoline/CNG bi-fuel vehicle in Egypt market (Hyundai-star) and is now assessed from the European standard driving cycle (ECE-15). The European driving cycle shows the characteristics of vehicles operating conditions for various speeds and acceleration ranges, but does not represent realistic speed-time history of a vehicle in actual traffic. As the driving conditions are different, the assessment results using this driving cycle may not produce realistic amounts of emissions and fuel consumption of the cars under emission tests, which were carried out for urban cycle. Two different fuel injection systems (i.e., multi-point injection (MPI)-sequential and closed-loop venturi-continuous) are used. The vehicle is equipped with infrared gas analyzer and magnetic pickup transducer to measure the concentration of exhaust constituents and engine rotational speed, respectively. The measurements were conducted at different vehicle speed. The results indicate that most of the carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2),and unburned total hydrocarbons (THC) emission appears at higher load as well as near the idling speed.

(B.) microplus, commonly known as cattle and southern cattle tick, respectively, impede the development and sustainability of livestock industries throughout tropical and other world regions. They affect animal productivity and wellbeing directly through their obligate blood-feeding habit and indirectly by serving as vectors of the infectious agents causing bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis. The monumental scientific discovery of certain arthropod species as vectors of infectious agents is associated with the history of research on bovine babesiosis and R. annulatus. Together, R. microplus and R. annulatus are referred to as cattle fever ticks (CFT). Bovine babesiosis became a regulated foreign animal disease in the United States of America (U.S.) through efforts of the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) established in 1906. The U.S. was declared free of CFT in 1943, with the exception of a permanent quarantine zone in south Texas along the border with Mexico. This achievement contributed greatly to the development and productivity of animal agriculture in the U.S. The permanent quarantine zone buffers CFT incursions from Mexico where both ticks and babesiosis are endemic. Until recently, the elimination of CFT outbreaks relied solely on the use of coumaphos, an organophosphate acaricide, in dipping vats or as a spray to treat livestock, or the vacation of pastures. However, ecological, societal, and economical changes are shifting the paradigm of systematically treating livestock to eradicate CFT. Keeping the U.S. CFT-free is a critical animal health issue affecting the economic stability of livestock and wildlife enterprises. Here, we describe vulnerabilities associated with global change forces challenging the CFTEP. The concept of integrated CFT eradication is discussed in reference to global change.","Babesiosis; Cattle; Climate; Global change; Integrated eradication; Modeling; Sustainability; Tick",,"Pérez de Leon, A.A.; Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock Insects Research Laboratory, 2700 Fredericksburg Drive, Kerrville, TX 78028, United States; эл. почта: beto.perezdeleon@ars.usda.gov",,,1664042X,,,,"English","Front.

It is considered as a renewable resource and sustainable solution for reducing global fossil fuel consumption and combating global warming. In general, it must be transported from production plants to demand points. Thus, the delivery process of its supply chain leads to the possibility of there being new forms of hazard. Pipelines have proven to be one of the cheapest ways to transport hydrogen. However, failures in pipelines can pose major risks. In this context, this paper proposes a multicriteria decision model for assessing the risk in hydrogen pipelines. By incorporating the decision maker's preferences structure into the decision process, the model enables sections of the pipeline to be ranked in terms of risk. The model proposed in this work is considered as an evolution of previous studies in the area, due to new features incorporated in the process. Finally, a numerical application is conducted in order to test the model. Highlights: We propose a multicriteria decision model for risk analysis in hydrogen pipelines. The model enables ranking sections of the pipeline based on multidimensional risk. The model incorporates human, environmental and financial risks. Analyzing the outputs increments in risk and ratios between risks are considered. © 2012 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Hydrogen pipeline; Multi-attribute utility theory; Multicriteria decision model; Multidimensional risk analysis","Conventional fuel; Decision maker's preferences; Decision process; Delivery process; Financial risks; Hydrogen pipelines; Multi-attribute utility theory; Multicriteria decision; New forms; Numerical applications; Production plant; Renewable resource; Specific energy; Sustainable solution; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Hydrogen; Models; Supply chains; Pipelines","De Almeida, A.T.; Federal University of Pernambuco, Cx.

While the molecular scheme of the phototransduction pathway is essentially the same in rods and cones, the enzymes and protein regulators that constitute the pathway are distinct. These enzymes and regulators can differ in the quantitative features of their functions or in concentration if their functions are similar or both can be true. The molecular identity and distinct function of the molecules of the transduction cascade in rods and cones are summarized. The functional significance of these molecular differences is examined with a mathematical model of the signal-transducing enzymatic cascade. Constrained by available electrophysiological, biochemical and biophysical data, the model simulates photocurrents that match well the electrical photoresponses measured in both rods and cones.

Such crops exhibit low rates of molecular polymorphism and high linkage disequilibrium, which reduces mapping resolution. The cherry type tomato (S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme) genome has been described as an admixture between the cultivated tomato and its wild ancestor, S. pimpinellifolium. We have thus taken advantage of the properties of this admixture to improve the resolution of association mapping in tomato. As a proof of concept, we sequenced 81 DNA fragments distributed on chromosome 2 at different distances in a core collection of 90 tomato accessions, including mostly cherry type tomato accessions. The 81 Sequence Tag Sites revealed 352 SNPs and indels. Molecular diversity was greatest for S. pimpinellifolium accessions, intermediate for S. l. cerasiforme accessions, and lowest for the cultivated group. We assessed the structure of molecular polymorphism and the extent of linkage disequilibrium over genetic and physical distances. Linkage disequilibrium decreased under r2 = 0.3 within 1 cM, and minimal estimated value (r2 = 0.13) was reached within 20 kb over the physical regions studied. Associations between polymorphisms and fruit weight, locule number, and soluble solid content were detected. Several candidate genes and quantitative trait loci previously identified were validated and new associations detected. This study shows the advantages of using a collection of S. l. cerasiforme accessions to overcome the low resolution of association mapping in tomato. © 2012 Ranc et al.","Admixture; Association mapping; Linkage disequilibrium; Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum)","article; DNA sequence; fruit; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association; genetic variability; genetics; open reading frame; phenotype; plant chromosome; plant genome; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; tomato; Chromosomes, Plant; Fruit; Genetic Variation; Genome, Plant; Genome-Wide Association Study; Linkage Disequilibrium; Lycopersicon esculentum; Open Reading Frames; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Sequence Analysis, DNA","Causse, M.; INRA UR 1052, Unité de Génétique et, Domaine St Maurice BP 94, Montfavet Cedex, 84143, France; эл. почта: Mathilde.Causse@avignon.inra.fr",,,21601836,,,"22908034","English","G3 Genes Genome Genet.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883363081

Political ecologies of the precarious incorporate an affective stance that allows people to live with apparent contradictions, reassuring them that they can poison the world without limit even as they recognize that a limit must be out there somewhere and suturing them to ecological demise even as they work against it. Through a series of ethnographic ""stopgaps"" set in Chicago, New Delhi, and Venice, this essay examines the part played by Henry Ford's iconic product, the automobile, in cultivating this affective stance by bringing ""the masses"" into an intimate, visceral engagement with the products of synthetic chemistry. The story of how the car became a leading protagonist in quest narratives of the path to sustainability suggests ways to reinvent such affective intimacies by organizing the world into something other than a collection of resources waiting to be managed. © 2012 by the Institute for Ethnographic Research (IFER) a part of the George Washington University.

In each case, a woman's suffering is presented and instrumentalised. However, the new media ecology offers an increasingly irregular economy of media modulation: digital footage may emerge today, in a year or never, and it may emerge anywhere to anyone. The cases analysed here allow for reflection on the tension between contingency and intentionality as that irregular economy brings uncertainty for the political actors involved. Dua Khalil Aswad, an Iraqi teenager of the Yazidi faith, was stoned to death by a Yazidi mob consisting of tens of men, mostly her relatives. One Yazidi uploaded a film of the killing. This led to violent reprisals against the Yazidis. Camilia Shehata is a young Coptic Egyptian who, after allegedly converting to Islam, was returned to her church with the help of Egyptian security forces and kept in hiding despite public protests. Extremists in Iraq and Egypt seized on the Shehata case to justify violence against Christians.

In addition to their structural complexity, cnidocytes display complex sensory attributes, integrating both chemical and mechanical cues from the environment into their discharge behavior. Despite more than a century of work aimed at understanding the sensory biology of cnidocytes, the specific sensory receptor genes that regulate their function remain unknown.Results: Here we report that light also regulates cnidocyte function. We show that non-cnidocyte neurons located in battery complexes of the freshwater polyp Hydra magnipapillata specifically express opsin, cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) ion channel and arrestin, which are all known components of bilaterian phototransduction cascades. We infer from behavioral trials that different light intensities elicit significant effects on cnidocyte discharge propensity. Harpoon-like stenotele cnidocytes show a pronounced diminution of discharge behavior under bright light conditions as compared to dim light. Further, we show that suppression of firing by bright light is ablated by cis-diltiazem, a specific inhibitor of CNG ion channels.Conclusions: Our results implicate an ancient opsin-mediated phototransduction pathway and a previously unknown layer of sensory complexity in the control of cnidocyte discharge. These findings also suggest a molecular mechanism for the regulation of other cnidarian behaviors that involve both photosensitivity and cnidocyte function, including diurnal feeding repertoires and/or substrate-based locomotion. More broadly, our findings highlight one novel, non-visual function for opsin-mediated phototransduction in a cnidarian, the origins of which might have preceded the evolution of cnidarian eyes. © 2012 Plachetzki et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Arrestin; Cnidaria; Cnidocyte; Cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel; Opsin; Phototransduction; Stenotele","Animalia; Bilateria; Cnidaria; Hydra; Hydra magnipapillata; calcium channel blocking agent; diltiazem; opsin; animal; article; cytology; drug effect; gene expression profiling; genetics; Hydra; light; metabolism; nerve cell; phototransduction; physiology; Animals; Calcium Channel Blockers; Diltiazem; Gene Expression Profiling; Hydra; Light; Light Signal Transduction; Neurons; Opsins","Plachetzki, D.C.; Center for Population Biology, One Shields Avenue, Davis CA, 95616, United States; эл. почта: plachetzki@ucdavis.edu",,,17417007,,,"22390726","English","BMC Biol.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857662090

The scientific methodology of the presented knowledge relies on simulation models validated by real-world tank-to-wheel emission and energy measurements performed in urban and extra urban areas as well as on freeways. Furthermore, an overview of the recent development of energy storage systems, energy converters, and powertrains in developed regions is given. Based on a statistically average European passenger car, fuel and energy consumption of conventional diesel, gasoline hybrid, fuel cell, and battery electric powertrains are compared. Special focus is given to the real-world energy consumption of the vehicles. This means auxiliary power units of the car such as onboard electronics, safety systems, heating, and air conditioning have significant influence on the fuel consumption, especially in driving conditions with lower speeds. The results show that for typical real-world operational conditions during the seasons of a whole year the hybrid vehicle and, with some limitations in the range of operation, fuel cell vehicle are comparable to the usability of a conventional vehicle. Battery electric vehicles (BEV) have very limited range. For the consistent comparison of propulsion systems with such different energy carriers, like liquid fuels, gaseous hydrogen, and electric power, the energy consumption with respect to primary energy supply was carried out. Based on this approach, the distance related energy consumption of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles is somewhat favorable compared to the conventional vehicle. Battery electric vehicles consume significantly more energy due to inefficiencies in power production and transmission as well as charging and discharging losses. Nevertheless, cars with fuel cell and battery electric propulsion systems have the considerable benefit of local emissions-free driving. © Springer-Verlag London Ltd. 2012.

This book finds emerging innovations and first signs of green urbanism in Asia and suggests they may be the guiding light for the rest of the world. The authors highlight seven archetypal cities exhibiting green urbanism: the renewable energy city, the bioregional carbon neutral city, the distributed city, the biophilic city, the eco-efficient city, the place-based city and the sustainable transport city. The book is a must-read for all who are concerned with the future of our cities as it instills hope that a greener urban future is possible. © 2013 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

The twenty-first century will be increasingly urban. Sustainable development therefore needs first to be defined and analyzed, and then realized in urban settings. Energy is one of the key challenges, but also one of the key opportunities in the required urban sustainability transition.The book is the result of a major international effort to conduct the first comprehensive assessment of energy-related urban sustainability issues conducted under the auspices of the Global Energy Assessment (GEA). The assessment is also unique in that it embeds energy issues into the broader sustainability agenda of cities: including housing for the poor, functional transport systems, as well as environmental quality, in addition to the challenges imposed by climate change.Written by an eminent team of internationally renowned scholars it presents new data, new analysis, as well as new policy insights. It includes the first comprehensive global coverage overview of urban energy use and of the specifics of urban energy demand and supply. Major development and sustainability challenges of cities are assessed in detail and public and private sector opportunities and constraints of a sustainability transition examined in detail. Technological and policy options are put in a much needed context in terms of their respective role as drivers of urban energy demand as well as potentials for reductions in energy use and associated emissions of local pollutants as well as greenhouse gases. The analysis presents both a comprehensive literature review as well as novel, spatially explicit models of integrated urban energy policy analysis. The volume concludes with a summary assessment of policy options, priorities as well as paradoxes. © 2013 Arnulf Grubler and David.",,,"Grubler, A.; International Institute for Applied Systems AnalysisAustria",,"Taylor and Francis",,9780203110126,,,"English","Energizing Sustainable Cities: Assess.

Hence, it is important to develop salt-tolerant crops. Understanding the mechanisms that enable plant growth under saline conditions is therefore required. Acclimation of plants to salinized conditions depends upon activation of cascades of molecular networks involved in stress sensing, signal transduction, and the expression of specific stress-related genes and metabolites. The stress signal is first perceived at the membrane level by the receptors and then transduced in the cell to switch on the stress-responsive genes which mediate stress tolerance. In addition to stress-adaptative mechanisms developed by plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have been shown to improve plant tolerance to abiotic environmental factors such as salinity. In this review, we emphasize the significance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi alleviation of salt stress and their beneficial effects on plant growth and productivity. Although salinity can affect negatively arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, many reports show improved growth and performance of mycorrhizal plants under salt stress conditions. These positive effects are explained by improved host plant nutrition, higher K +/Na + ratios in plant tissues and a better osmotic adjustment by accumulation of compatible solutes such as proline, glycine betaine, or soluble sugars. Arbuscular mycorrhizal plants also improve photosynthetic- and water use efficiency under salt stress. Arbuscular mycorrhizal plants enhance the activity of antioxidant enzymes in order to cope with the reactive oxygen species generated by salinity. At the molecular level, arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis regulates the expression of plant genes involved in the biosynthesis of proline, of genes encoding aquaporins, and of genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant proteins, with chaperone activity. The regulation of these genes allows mycorrhizal plants to maintain a better water status in their tissues. Gene expression patterns suggest that mycorrhizal plants are less strained by salt stress than non-mycorrhizal plants. In contrast, scarce information is available on the possible regulation by the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis of plant genes encoding Na +/H + antiporters or cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. These genes encode proteins with a key role in the regulation of uptake, distribution and compartimentation of sodium and other ions within the plant, and are major determinants for the salt sensitiveness of a plant. Thus, we propose that investigating the participation of cation proton antiporters and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels on arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis under salinity is a promising field that should shed further light on new mechanisms involved in the enhanced tolerance of mycorrhizal plants to salt stress. © INRA and Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Abiotic stress; Antioxidant; Aquaporin; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Cation antiporter; Homeostasis; Salinity; Stress tolerance","antioxidant; arbuscular mycorrhiza; compartmentalization; crop production; environmental stress; fungus; gene expression; growth rate; homeostasis; irrigation system; photosynthesis; protein; salinity tolerance; symbiosis; water use efficiency; Arbuscular; Fungi","Porcel, R.; Departamento de Microbiología Del Suelo y Sistemas Simbióticos, Prof. Albareda, 1, 18008 Granada, Spain; эл. почта: rporcel@eez.csic.es",,,17740746,,,,"English","Agron.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) methods can be used to estimate potential emissions reductions through the use of such fuels. Some recent policies have used the results of LCAs to encourage the use of low carbon fuels to meet future energy demands in the U.S., without, however, acknowledging and addressing the uncertainty and variability prevalent in LCA. Natural gas is a particularly interesting fuel since it can be used to meet various energy demands, for example, as a transportation fuel or in power generation. Estimating the magnitudes and likelihoods of achieving emissions reductions from competing end-uses of natural gas using LCA offers one way to examine optimal strategies of natural gas resource allocation, given that its availability is likely to be limited in the future.In this study, the uncertainty in life cycle GHG emissions of natural gas (domestic and imported) consumed in the U.S. was estimated using probabilistic modeling methods. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to obtain sample distributions representing life cycle GHG emissions from the use of 1 MJ of domestic natural gas and imported LNG. Life cycle GHG emissions per energy unit of average natural gas consumed in the U.S were found to range between -8 and 9% of the mean value of 66 g CO 2e/MJ. The probabilities of achieving emissions reductions by using natural gas for transportation and power generation, as a substitute for incumbent fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and coal were estimated. The use of natural gas for power generation instead of coal was found to have the highest and most likely emissions reductions (almost a 100% probability of achieving reductions of 60 g CO 2e/MJ of natural gas used), while there is a 10-35% probability of the emissions from natural gas being higher than the incumbent if it were used as a transportation fuel. This likelihood of an increase in GHG emissions is indicative of the potential failure of a climate policy targeting reductions in GHG emissions. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Climate policy; Emissions reduction; End-uses; Energy demands; Energy units; GHG emission; Life-cycle assessments; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Low carbon; Mean values; Monte Carlo Simulation; Natural gas resources; Optimal strategies; Probabilistic modeling; Sample distributions; Transportation fuels; Uncertainty and variability; Carbon dioxide; Coal transportation; Computer simulation; Energy resources; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Monte Carlo methods; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Petroleum deposits; Uncertainty analysis; Natural gas transportation; carbon; carbon dioxide; coal; fuel; gasoline; natural gas; carbon dioxide; emission control; emission inventory; energy resource; environmental policy; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; Monte Carlo analysis; natural gas; numerical model; policy analysis; pollution policy; power generation; resource allocation; transportation; uncertainty analysis; article; carbon footprint; carbon source; diesel engine; energy; futurology; life cycle assessment; policy; power supply; probability; resource allocation; uncertainty; United States; Environmental Policy; Gas, Natural; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Chemical; Probability; Uncertainty; United States; Vehicle Emissions; United States","Venkatesh, A.; Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890, United States; эл. почта: aranya@cmu.edu",,,0013936X,,ESTHA,"21846117","English","Environ.

It is, therefore, imperative to analyze indoor air quality (IAQ) and its determinants and to consider the contribution of IAQ to possible health outcomes at the household level. Based on empirical data collected from 5949 households from 35 wards of Delhi, it can be summarized that higher proportions of residents live in degraded indoor environmental conditions. The highest risks to health were attached to use of traditional fuels (64%), lack of a kitchen (59%), exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) (55%), and poor ventilation (55%). Acute respiratory infections (43%) were identified as one of the most prevalent health problems confronted by residents and are strongly associated with use of traditional fuels (adjusted OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.3-3.1). Asthma shows a significant relationship with the use of traditional fuels (adjusted OR 3.8, 95% CI 3.4-4.3), exposure to ETS (adjusted OR 2.5, 95% CI 2.2-2.7), and poor ventilation (adjusted OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.41). Lung cancer (adjusted OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.38-1.71) and cardiovascular diseases (adjusted OR 2.25, 95% CI 2.01-2.53) also show a strong relationship with ETS exposure. More research is neeeded. Practical Implications: The present study can help to create new insights in understanding the gravity of indoor air quality problems in Delhi and can therefore provide interesting material to social scientists, public health officers, planners, and decision makers. The information can be utilized to help formulate comprehensive policies and planning with a humanistic approach for proper urban indoor environments that will be applicable at all administrative levels, viz. local, national, and international, and will also provide an important background for additional research in this area. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Delhi; Environment tobacco smoke; Health outcomes; Indoor environment; Traditional fuels","air conditioning; article; asthma; cardiovascular disease; case control study; city; cooking; housing; human; India; indoor air pollution; lung tumor; male; passive smoking; risk factor; Air Pollution, Indoor; Asthma; Cardiovascular Diseases; Case-Control Studies; Cities; Cooking; Housing; Humans; India; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Risk Factors; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Ventilation; Nicotiana tabacum","Firdaus, G.; Department of Geography, , U.P. 202002, India; эл. почта: zebaish-gf@yahoo.com",,,09056947,,INAIE,"21410536","English","Indoor Air",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052627593

This signaling cascade is characterized by a sequence of two currents: a cation current through cyclic nucleotide-gated channels followed by a chloride current through calcium-activated chloride channels. To date, it is not possible to interfere with these generator channels under physiological conditions with potent and specific blockers. In this study we identified the styryl dye FM1-43 as a potent blocker of native olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channels.

Establishing sustainable disease resistance and maintaining cocoa qualities are among the major objectives of breeding programs. To enrich the high-density genetic map, useful for all cocoa genetic studies, with gene-based markers, a recently produced large EST resource was mined to develop expressed sequence tag-based simple sequence repeat markers (EST-SSRs) defined in genes with a putative known function. A set of 174 polymorphic EST-SSRs was identified from a selection of 314 non-redundant EST-SSRs with a putative known function. Of them, 115 loci were mapped on the cocoa reference map. This new map contains 582 codominant markers arranged in ten linkage groups corresponding to the haploid number of chromosomes. An average interval between markers of 1. 3 cM was found, with approximately one SSR every 2 cM. This new set of EST-SSRs includes 14 candidate genes for plant resistance or cocoa qualities. The percentage of polymorphic SSRs varied depending on the different gene regions from which they originated, with respectively 54%, 69%, and 82% of polymorphic EST-SSRs originating from coding sequences, and from the non-coding untranslated 5′UTR and 3′UTR regions. This new map contains a set of 384 SSR markers that are easily transferable across different mapping populations and useful for all genetic analyses in T. cacao.

Fish production and processing wastes are a significant source of material for bioenergy production. Norway is a country of high fish production, but currently low development of the bioenergy sector due to the ample availability of hydropower. World fish consumption per capita nearly doubled over the last 45 years. The resulting increase in fish processing wastes and the expansion of the renewable energy market imply that fish processing wastes could play a part in the future of biofuels. Fish processing wastes rich in fat may be used for biodiesel, although blending with other diesels may be necessary to meet biodiesel specification standards. Fish processing wastes are also suitable for biogas production, although these materials will have to be added as a co-substrate to boost the biogas production of plants treating agricultural or municipal wastes, due to the inhibitory effects of long chain fatty acids and high protein concentrations.

Upon invasion by the fungal pathogen Drechmeria coniospora, C. elegans responds by upregulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the epidermis via activation of at least two pathways, a neuroendocrine TGF-β pathway and a p38 MAPK pathway. Here, we identify the sodium-neurotransmitter symporter SNF-12, a member of the solute carrier family (SLC6), as being essential for both these immune signaling pathways. We also identify the STAT transcription factor-like protein STA-2 as a direct physical interactor of SNF-12 and show that the two proteins function together to regulate AMP gene expression in the epidermis. Both SNF-12 and STA-2 act cell autonomously and specifically in the epidermis to govern the transcriptional response to fungal infection. These findings reveal an unorthodox mode of regulation for a STAT factor and highlight the molecular plasticity of innate immune signaling. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,"adenosine phosphate; neurotransmitter; protein snf 12; protein sta 2; STAT protein; unclassified drug; article; Caenorhabditis elegans; controlled study; endosome; epidermis; gene control; immunoprecipitation; innate immunity; mycosis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein function; protein protein interaction; skin infection; Animals; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Epidermis; GABA Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Hypocreales; Immunity, Innate; Models, Biological; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Mapping; STAT Transcription Factors; Caenorhabditis elegans; Drechmeria coniospora","Ewbank, J.

Molecular epidemiology constitutes the main methodology for understanding the factors underpinning the emergence of this understudied, yet increasingly important, group of pathogenic fungi. Cryptococcus species are notable in the degree that virulence differs amongst lineages, and highly-virulent emerging lineages are changing patterns of human disease both temporally and spatially. Cryptococcus neoformans variety grubii (Cng, serotype A) constitutes the most ubiquitous cause of cryptococcal meningitis worldwide, however patterns of molecular diversity are understudied across some regions experiencing significant burdens of disease. We compared 183 clinical and environmental isolates of Cng from one such region, Thailand, Southeast Asia, against a global MLST database of 77 Cng isolates. Population genetic analyses showed that Thailand isolates from 11 provinces were highly homogenous, consisting of the same genetic background (globally known as VNI) and exhibiting only ten nearly identical sequence types (STs), with three (STs 44, 45 and 46) dominating our sample. This population contains significantly less diversity when compared against the global population of Cng, specifically Africa. Genetic diversity in Cng was significantly subdivided at the continental level with nearly half (47%) of the global STs unique to a genetically diverse and recombining population in Botswana. These patterns of diversity, when combined with evidence from haplotypic networks and coalescent analyses of global populations, are highly suggestive of an expansion of the Cng VNI clade out of Africa, leading to a limited number of genotypes founding the Asian populations. Divergence time testing estimates the time to the most common ancestor between the African and Asian populations to be 6,920 years ago (95% HPD 122.96 - 27,177.76). Further high-density sampling of global Cng STs is now necessary to resolve the temporal sequence underlying the global emergence of this human pathogen. © 2011 Simwami et al.",,"acquired immune deficiency syndrome; AIDS patient; allele; article; cerebrospinal fluid culture; cerebrospinal fluid pressure; comparative study; controlled study; cryptococcal meningitis; Cryptococcus neoformans; DNA extraction; ethnic group; fungal virulence; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; gene mutation; genetic variability; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; multilocus sequence typing; phylogeny; population genetics; randomized controlled trial; Thailand; Africa; AIDS related complex; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; cryptococcal meningitis; DNA sequence; drug combination; fungal gene; genetic variability; genetics; microbiological examination; microbiology; molecular epidemiology; molecular genetics; pathogenicity; species difference; Thailand; Filobasidiella neoformans; Fungi; antifungal agent; antiretrovirus agent; fungal DNA; Africa; AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Antifungal Agents; Cryptococcus neoformans; DNA, Fungal; Drug Therapy, Combination; Genes, Mating Type, Fungal; Genetic Variation; Humans; Meningitis, Cryptococcal; Molecular Epidemiology; Molecular Sequence Data; Mycological Typing Techniques; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Thailand","Fisher, M.

A novel way to improve surveillance efŽciency is to concentrate surveillance in areas that are more likely to contain the weed, or are more susceptible to invasion, by replicating the various dispersal syndromes and plant life history factors that influence the spread of invasive plants. These areas can then be targeted for surveillance, potentially improving the success of containment and eradication efforts. Management and control actions such as eradication scenarios can then be applied to the simulated invasion and evaluated for effectiveness. This chapter presents a geographic information system (GIS) toolbox for surveillance decision support, discusses design elements of the toolbox, and demonstrates its application to Chilean needle grass (CNG) (Nassella neesiana), a highly invasive perennial tussock grass that has spread across agricultural areas of Australia. The toolbox consists of Python functions that replicate elements of invasive plant establishment, growth, and dispersal and also simulate surveillance and eradication strategies. These elements are placed in an iterative loop so the annual cycle of establishment, growth, dispersal, and management strategies can be modeled for multiple years. The toolbox is integrated with ArcGIS for direct application to known spatial information on invasive plant incursions. Simulation outputs are written to the GIS for spatial interrogation and map preparation for rapid communication to land managers. The toolbox has been designed as a decision support tool for managers and researchers of serious plant invasions and is being used in Australia for this purpose.

Hence, the past trend of energy consumption and emissions are applied in order to predict the future pattern. In addition, a model of transportation system using computer based software called ""Long Range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP)"" has been developed together with the associated Environmental Database (EDB) model. The framework of calculation utilized official transportation database, fuel consumption of certain vehicle type and corresponding emission of each vehicle type. The base scenario called as Business -As- Usual (BAU) is surveyed and other different alternative scenarios are presented and discussed. The model is run under the database of 2001 as the base year and extrapolated until 2030 to predict the impact of transportation.

The focus of this paper is to assess the environmental benefits of alternative fuels and advanced hybrid drive technologies in transit vehicles through experimental testing and analysis. Results show that hybrid-electric diesel and CNG buses yield significant reductions in CO2 emissions, approximately 10-20% lower than conventional diesel. Stoichiometric CNG buses demonstrated extremely low emissions of NOx, while conventional, lean-burn CNG had the highest NOx emissions, approximately twice that of hybrid technologies and conventional diesel engines. The hybrid-electric technology demonstrated the highest fuel economy, while CNG has the lowest fuel economy.

Liquefaction of natural gas provides a safer and economical alternative for transportation and also increases its storage capabilities. The liquefaction process requires the natural gas to be cooled using various methods of cryogenic processes and also be depressurized to atmospheric conditions for easier and safer storage. LNG transported in cryogenic vessels offers several advantages over pipeline transport of natural gas especially when the gas consuming areas are far away from the gas producing areas. Moreover, LNG as an automobile fuel has a definite edge over other fuels.This article presents an overview on the characteristics of LNG, present state of affairs of LNG, its import from overseas, CNG vs. LNG as an automobile fuel, eco-friendliness of natural gas fuel, etc. It also discusses the potential of natural gas production from different sources. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Compressed natural gas; Cryogenic fuel; Green house gases; Liquefied natural gas; Pollution prevention","Compressed natural gas; Cryogenics; Energy resources; Gas fuels; Greenhouse gases; Liquefaction of gases; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas well production; Sustainable development; Atmospheric conditions; Cryogenic fuel; Cryogenic fuels; Cryogenic process; Cryogenic vessel; Eco-friendly; Global levels; Liquefaction process; Natural-gas production; Pipeline transport; Pollution prevention; State of affairs; Storage capability; Natural gas transportation; compressed air; cryogenic fluid; gas industry; gas pipeline; gas production; gas storage; gas supply; greenhouse gas; liquefaction; liquefied natural gas; natural gas; pollution control; sustainability; sustainable development; transportation safety","Moon, I.; Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, 262-Seongsanno, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 120-749, South Korea; эл. почта: ilmoon@yonsei.ac.kr",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Newly discovered members from bacteria and marine invertebrates provide a wealth of structural and functional information on this channel family. A hallmark of classical tetrameric cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels is their cooperative activation by binding of several ligands. By contrast, the new members seem to be uncooperative, and binding of a single ligand molecule suffices to open these channels. These new findings provide a fresh look at the mechanism of allosteric activation of ion channels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"cyclic nucleotide gated channel; allosterism; bacterium; binding affinity; cell type; channel gating; invertebrate; ligand binding; marine species; molecular mechanics; nerve cell; priority journal; protein function; protein structure; review; signal transduction; sperm; Animals; Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels; Ion Channel Gating; Ligands; Protein Binding; Invertebrata","Kaupp, U.B.; Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research, Padualaan 8, 3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; эл. почта: u.b.kaupp@caesar.de",,,09680004,,TBSCD,"20729090","English","Trends Biochem.

Key regulatory proteins in this process are the cold-induced CBF1, 2 and 3 transcription factors which control many cold regulated genes. Although much work has focused on this signal transduction pathway, the details of its regulation and of its quantitative contribution to cold acclimation are still unclear. Here, we have used the large natural variation present in the 48 accessions of the Versailles core collection of Arabidopsis thaliana to further elucidate the function of the CBF transcription factors. CBF gene expression studies showed that the freezing sensitive accessions had mostly low expression levels 2. h after transfer of plants to 5 °C, while the most tolerant accessions showed a wide range of CBF expression levels. To investigate the quantitative contribution of CBF expression to plant freezing tolerance and low temperature growth performance, RNAi lines targeting all three CBF genes were produced in eight different accessions. We observed striking differences between different accessions in the effects that reduced CBF expression had on freezing tolerance, while effects on growth were generally too small to draw firm conclusions. Analysis of CBF expression indicated a tight co-regulation between CBF1 and CBF3, while the relationship between the expression levels of CBF2 and CBF1 or CBF3 strongly depended on the genetic background of the RNAi lines. In agreement with the observed differences between the different accessions, QTL analyses with two different RIL populations indicated that QTL localisation varies strongly between populations. Collectively, these results show that both the regulation of the CBF genes and their relative contribution to freezing tolerance strongly depend on the accession studied. In addition, natural variation is suggested to be an interesting source of novel regulatory pathways and genes that may be useful in the future for improving plant freezing tolerance. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Arabidopsis; CBF; Cold acclimation; QTL mapping; RNAi","Arabidopsis protein; Arabidopsis; article; freezing; gene expression regulation; genetics; methodology; physiology; quantitative trait locus; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Freezing; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Quantitative Trait Loci; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Interference; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana","Téoulé, E.; Institut Jean-Pierre Bourgin, Bât. 7, Route de St Cyr, 78026 Versailles Cedex, France; эл. почта: Evelyne.Teoule@versailles.inra.fr",,,01689452,,PLSCE,"21421342","English","Plant Sci.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149497123

The pneumostome closure response is part of the defense reaction in Lymnaea. The shadow or 'light-off' stimulus elicits activity in a higher order interneuron, RPeD11, which has a major role in mediating defensive withdrawal behavior elicited by noxious or threatening stimuli. Here, we tested our hypothesis that cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are involved in the dermal photoreceptor-mediated transduction of the shadow stimulus. The response to the shadow stimulus recorded in RPeD11 was abolished by 500 μM cis-diltiazem, which blocks cGMP-activated conductance of CNG channels. On the other hand, the shadow response elicited in RPeD11 was not blocked by 2-amino ethyldiphenyl borate (2-APB), a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel blocker. Consistent with the electrophysiologic data, cis-diltiazem blocked the shadow-evoked withdrawal response, whereas 2-APB did not block the withdrawal response evoked by the shadow stimulus in intact freely behaving Lymnaea. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that the second messenger in dermal photoreceptors involves CNG and not TRP channels. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel; Dermal photoreceptor; Right pedal dorsal 11 neuron; Transient receptor potential (TRP) channel; Withdrawal behavior","2 aminoethoxydiphenylborane; 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; boron derivative; cyclic GMP; cyclic nucleotide gated channel; diltiazem; animal; article; drug effect; functions of the skin and its appendages; interneuron; Lymnaea; photoreceptor cell; photostimulation; phototransduction; physiology; Animals; Boron Compounds; Cyclic GMP; Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels; Diltiazem; Interneurons; Light Signal Transduction; Lymnaea; Photic Stimulation; Photoreceptor Cells; Skin Physiological Phenomena; Gastropoda; Lymnaea; Lymnaea stagnalis; Lymnaeidae","Sakakibara, M.; Laboratory of Neurobiological Engineering, , Numazu, Shizuoka 410-0321, Japan; эл. почта: manabu@tokai.ac.jp",,,01741578,,JCPBD,"20567976","English","J.

This could be detrimental when radionuclides such as 137Cs and 90Sr are involved. In this study, both genetic and physiological aspects of Cs+ and Sr 2+ accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated using 86 Arabidopsis accessions and a segregating F2 population of the low Cs+ accumulating Sq-1 (Ascot, UK) crossed with the high uptaking Sorbo (Khurmatov, Tajikistan). Hydroponically grown plants were exposed to subtoxic levels of Cs+ and Sr2+ using radioactive isotopes as tracers. In the natural accessions shoot concentration of Cs+ as well as Sr2+ varied about 2-fold, whereas its heritability ranged for both ions between 0.60 and 0.73. Shoot accumulation of Cs+ and Sr2+ could be compromised by increasing concentrations of their essential analogues K+ and Ca2+, respectively, causing a reduction of up to 80%. In the case of the segregating F2/F3 population Sq-13Sorbo, this study identified several QTL for the trait Cs+ and Sr2+ accumulation, with main QTL on chromosomes 1 and 5. According to the correlation and discrimination surveys combined with QTL-analysis Cs + and Sr2+ uptake seemed to be mediated mostly via non-selective cation channels. A polymorphism, affecting amino acids close to the K+-pore of one candidate, CYCLIC-NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNEL 1 (CNGC1), was identified in Sorbo and associated with high Cs+ concentrating accessions. © 2010 The Author(s).","Accumulation; Arabidopsis; caesium (Cs+); discrimination; quantitative trait loci (QTL); strontium (Sr2+)","Arabidopsis protein; calcium; cesium; cyclic nucleotide gated channel; potassium; strontium; cesium; soil pollutant; strontium; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; article; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; quantitative trait locus; soil pollutant; Arabidopsis; soil pollutant; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Calcium; Cesium Radioisotopes; Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels; Molecular Sequence Data; Potassium; Quantitative Trait Loci; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive; Strontium Radioisotopes; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Calcium; Cesium Radioisotopes; Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels; Molecular Sequence Data; Potassium; Quantitative Trait Loci; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive; Strontium Radioisotopes","Kanter, U.; Institute of Radiation Protection, , D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; эл. почта: ulrike.kanter@helmholtz-muenchen.de",,,00220957,,JEBOA,"20624763","English","J.

Effects of stimulus intensity and adapting time on mixture component identification after adapting with one component were each studied in 10 human subjects. Odors of 1 and 5 mM vanillin (vanilla) and phenethyl alcohol (rose) were identified, with adapting time varied by sniffing naturally once or twice, or sniffing 5 times, once every 2 s. Odors of water-adapted single compounds were identified nearly perfectly (94%), self-adapted to 51% but did not cross-adapt (94%), showing the 2 compounds had quickly adapting independent odors. Identifications of the vanilla and rose odors in water-adapted mixtures were reduced to 59% and 79%, respectively. Following single-component adaptation, the average 33% identification of odors of adapted (ambient) mixture components contrasted with the greater average 86% identification of new unadapted (extra) mixture components. Identifications were lower for 1 than 5 mM components when concentrations were not matched, and ambient component identifications were lower after 10-s adaptation than after 1 or 2 sniffs.

In sea urchin spermatozoa, this relocation requires coordinated motility changes initiated by Ca2+-driven alterations in sperm flagellar curvature. We discovered that Lytechinus pictus spermatozoa undergo chemotaxis in response to speract, an egg-derived decapeptide previously noted to stimulate non-chemotactic motility alterations in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus spermatozoa. Sperm of both species responded to speract gradients with a sequence of turning episodes that correlate with transient flagellar Ca2+ increases, yet only L. pictus spermatozoa accumulated at the gradient source. Detailed analysis of sperm behavior revealed that L. pictus spermatozoa selectively undergo Ca2+ fluctuations while swimming along negative speract gradients while S. purpuratus sperm generate Ca2+ fluctuations in a spatially non-selective manner. This difference is attributed to the selective suppression of Ca2+ fluctuations of L. pictus spermatozoa as they swim towards the source of the chemoattractant gradient. This is the first study to compare and characterize the motility components that differ in chemotactic and non-chemotactic spermatozoa. Tuning of Ca2+ fluctuations and associated turning episodes to the chemoattractant gradient polarity is a central feature of sea urchin sperm chemotaxis and may be a feature of sperm chemotaxis in general. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Chemotaxis; Fertilization; Flagella; Sea urchin sperm; Sperm motility","calcium; polypeptide; speract; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; calcium current; calcium signaling; cell stimulation; chemotaxis; controlled study; fluorescence analysis; Lytechinus; Lytechinus pictus; nonhuman; priority journal; species comparison; spermatozoon motility; spermatozoon tail; Strongylocentrotus; Echinoidea; Invertebrata; Lytechinus pictus; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus","Wood, C.D.; Instituto de Biotecnología, Avenida Universidad 2001, Col.

The Brundtland Report argued that not only was it achievable, but that it was an urgent imperative in order to achieve a transition to sustainable development while significantly reducing poverty and driving 'clean and green' investment. With some still arguing for significantly slowing economic growth in order to reduce pressures on the environment, this new book, Cents and Sustainability, shows that it is possible to reconcile the need for economic growth and environmental sustainability through a strategy to decouple economic growth from environmental pressures, combined with a renewed commitment to achieve significant environmental restoration and poverty reduction. Beginning with a brief overview of some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, the book then explains 'decoupling theory', overviews a number of factors that can undermine and even block efforts to decouple in both developed and developing countries, and then discusses a number of key considerations to assist the development of national 'decoupling strategies'. The book then focuses on presenting evidence to support greater action, not just on climate change, but also on decoupling economic growth from the loss of biodiversity and the deterioration of natural systems, freshwater extraction, waste production, and air pollution. In the lead up to the 2012 United Nations Earth Summit and beyond, Cents and Sustainability will be a crucial guide to inform and assist nations to develop strategies to significantly reduce environmental pressures, strengthen their economy, create jobs and reduce poverty.

Phylogenetic studies of complex trait evolution often do not take this into account, instead focusing only on the history of whole, integrated traits; for example, mapping eyes as simply present or absent through history. Using the biochemistry of animal vision as a model, we demonstrate how investigating the individual components of complex systems can aid in elucidating both the origins and diversification of such systems. Opsin-based phototransduction underlies all visual phenotypes in animals, using complex protein cascades that translate light information into changes in cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) or canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) ion-channel activity. Here we show that CNG ion channels play a role in cnidarian phototransduction. Transcripts of a CNG ion channel co-localize with opsin in specific cell types of the eyeless cnidarian Hydra magnipapillata. Further, the CNG inhibitor cis-diltiazem ablates a stereotypical photoresponse in the hydra. Our findings in the Cnidaria, the only non-bilaterian lineage to possess functional opsins, allow us to trace the history of CNG-based photosensitivity to the very origin of animal phototransduction. Our general analytical approach, based on explicit phylogenetic analysis of individual components, contrasts the deep evolutionary history of CNG-based phototransduction, today used in vertebrate vision, with the more recent assembly of TRPC-based systems that are common to protostome (e.g. fly and mollusc) vision. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Ancestral state; Cnidarian; Complex trait evolution; Cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel; Opsin; Phototransduction","biochemistry; inhibitor; life history trait; numerical model; phenotype; phylogenetics; protein; vertebrate","Plachetzki, D.

This paper analyzed the successful practices of some EU countries, and proposed that China's guideline of organic waste/wastewater treatment should be reconsidered so that it could not only serve to environmental protection, but also gain some economic benefits, i.e., to produce commodity clean energy. Potentials of several traditional feedstock of biogas were inventoried, and approach for phasing out bottlenecks of technologies and policy were discussed.

Little is known about the CpG methylation status of the CCGG sequences in the orange genome. In this study, methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP), based on the application of isoschizomers (Hpa II and Msp I), was first used to analyze cytosine methylation patterns in 57 orange cultivars that were not fully differentiated by regular DNA molecular markers. Three types of bands were generated from ten primer pairs. Type I bands were present following restriction with Eco RI + Hpa II and Eco RI + Msp I; type II or type III were present only following restriction with either Eco RI + Hpa II or with Eco RI + Msp I. The total number of these three types of bands was 802, 72, and 157, respectively. Among these, the number of polymorphic bands were 244 (30.2%), 23 (31.9%), and 32 (20.4%), in type I, II and III, respectively. The methylation patterns of these 57 cultivars are discussed and assessed by dendrograms derived from the analysis of polymorphic MSAP bands. The distribution of polymorphic bands of the above three types demonstrate the methylation patterns and frequency at the cytosine loci. We suggest that methylation events could be more frequent than demethylation events, and that the methylation patterns maybe associated with phenotypic traits. © 2010 Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.","Demethylation; Full-methylation; Hemi-methylation; Methylation variation; MSAP; Orange","Citrus; Citrus sinensis","Fang, J.-G.; College of Horticulture, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, China; эл. почта: fanggg@njau.edu.cn",,,01375881,,APPLD,,"English","Acta Physiol.

In this study, we searched the human genome reference sequence and annotated exons (exome) for the presence of uninterrupted triplet repeat tracts composed of six or more repeated units. A list of 32 448 TNRs and 878 TNR-containing genes was generated and is provided herein. We found that some triplet repeats, specifically CNG, are overrepresented, while CTT, ATC, AAC and AAT are underrepresented in exons. This observation suggests that the occurrence of TNRs in exons is not random, but undergoes positive or negative selective pressure. Additionally, TNR types strongly determine their localization in mRNA sections (ORF, UTRs). Most genes containing exon-overrepresented TNRs are associated with gene ontology-defined functions. Surprisingly, many groups of genes that contain TNR types coding for different homo-amino acid tracts associate with the same transcription-related GO categories. We propose that TNRs have potential to be functional genetic elements and that their variation may be involved in the regulation of many common phenotypes; as such, TNR polymorphisms should be considered a priority in association studies. © The Author(s) 2010.

From the analysis of a male antennal expressed sequence tag library, we succeeded in cloning a full-length cDNA encoding a PLC that belongs to the cluster of PLC-β subtypes. In adult males, the PLC-β transcript was located predominantly in brain and antennae where its presence was detected in the olfactory sensilla trichodea. Moreover, PLC-β was expressed in antennae at the beginning of the pupal stage, then reached a maximum at the end of this stage and was maintained at this level during the adult period. Taken together, these results provided molecular evidence for the putative participation of a PLC-β in signaling pathways responsible for the establishment and the functioning of insect olfactory system. © The Author 2010.

Some components of novel traits have their mutational origins in duplication, subsequently followed by differential divergence in both form and function. Gene duplications are perhaps the best studied duplication events, but “duplication” (either by copying or by fission) happens at other levels of biological organization, including protein domains, groups of interacting proteins, chromosomes, genomes, cells, organs, castes, species, and ecosystems. Other novel traits originate as new combinations of existing traits, a process sometimes termed bricolage, or tinkering (Jacob 1977). As with duplication, recombinational novelties occur at multiple levels of biological organization: domains fuse to form new proteins, proteins gain new interactions with other proteins, cells/species merge as in the endosymbiotic origin of eukaryotes, and new ecological interactions emerge by dispersal of species. Recognizing and distinguishing duplication, and co-option requires a historical or phylogenetic perspective. © 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Oakley, T.H.; Ecology Evolution and Marine Biology, United States; эл. почта: oakley@lifesci.ucsb.edu",,"CRC Press",,9781439854020; 9781578086955,,,"English","Key Transitions in Animal Evolution",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033996642

Recent studies have shown that the necklace olfactory system in mice sensitively detects CO2 in the air. Olfactory CO2 neurons are believed to rely on cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as the key second messenger; however, the specific ion channel underlying CO2 responses remains unclear. Here we show that CO2-evoked neuronal and behavioral responses require cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels consisting of the CNGA3 subunit. Through Ca2+-imaging, we found that CO2-triggered Ca2+ influx was abolished in necklace olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of CNGA3-knockout mice. Olfactory detection tests using a Go/No-go paradigm showed that these knockout mice failed to detect 0.5% CO2. Thus, sensitive detection of atmospheric CO2 depends on the function of CNG channels consisting of the CNGA3 subunit in necklace OSNs. These data support the important role of the necklace olfactory system in CO2 sensing and extend our understanding of the signal transduction pathway mediating CO2 detection in mammals. © 2010 Current Zoology.","cGMP; CNG channels; Go/No-go; Guanylyl cyclase; Olfactory sensory neurons","Invertebrata; Mammalia; Mus; Vertebrata","Luo, M.; National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing 102206, China; эл. почта: luominmin@nibs.ac.cn",,"Chinese Academy of Sciences",16745507,,TWHPA,,"English","Curr.

Production of biogas provides a versatile carrier of renewable energy, as methane can be used for replacement of fossil fuels in both heat and power generation and as a vehicle fuel. For biogas production, various process types are applied which can be classified in wet and dry fermentation systems. Most often applied are wet digester systems using vertical stirred tank digester with different stirrer types dependent on the origin of the feedstock. Biogas is mainly utilized in engine-based combined heat and power plants, whereas microgas turbines and fuel cells are expensive alternatives which need further development work for reducing the costs and increasing their reliability. Gas upgrading and utilization as renewable vehicle fuel or injection into the natural gas grid is of increasing interest because the gas can be used in a more efficient way. The digestate from anaerobic fermentation is a valuable fertilizer due to the increased availability of nitrogen and the better short-term fertilization effect. Anaerobic treatment minimizes the survival of pathogens which is important for using the digested residue as fertilizer. This paper reviews the current state and perspectives of biogas production, including the biochemical parameters and feedstocks which influence the efficiency and reliability of the microbial conversion and gas yield. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Biogas upgrading; Biomass; Biomethanation; Co-digestion; Digestate; Dry fermentation; Energy crops; Methane potential; Wet fermentation","Biogas; Biomass; Cogeneration plants; Crops; Feedstocks; Fermentation; Fossil fuels; Fuel cell power plants; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Natural gas vehicles; Nitrogen fertilizers; Bio-methanation; Biogas upgrading; Codigestion; Digestate; Dry fermentation; Energy crops; Methane potential; Anaerobic digestion; acetic acid; ammonia; biogas; butyric acid; carbohydrate; carbon dioxide; cellulose; fat; fertilizer; fossil fuel; hemicellulose; hydrogen; hydrolase; methane; monomer; polymer; propionic acid; protein; trace element; alternative energy; anoxic conditions; biochemistry; biogas; combined heat and power; energy crop; fermentation; greenhouse gas; power plant; reliability analysis; renewable resource; sustainable development; waste treatment; anaerobic bacterium; anaerobic digestion; anaerobic fermentation; animal food; biomass production; biotechnology; cost; dehydrogenation; desulfurization; electric power plant; energy crop; energy resource; fermentation; fertilization; fluorescence in situ hybridization; forage crop; gas turbine power; hydrolysis; macronutrient; manure; mesophilic bacterium; methanogen; microbial biomass; microbial kinetics; nitrogen availability; nonhuman; pasteurization; pressure; process control; process technology; renewable energy; short survey; stirred reactor; thermogenesis","Weiland, P.; Johann Heinrich von Thünen-Institute, Braunschweig 38116, Germany; эл. почта: peter.weiland@vti.bund.de",,"Springer Verlag",01757598,,AMBID,"19777226","English","Appl.

The activity of the reference perovskites, LaBO3, and the new versions (with Pd introduction at the B-site) towards the combustion of methane, was evaluated in a Temperature Programmed Combustion (TPC) apparatus. Perovskite-type oxide containing Mn and Pd at the B-site was found to provide the best results.

Merr.). Can. J. Plant Sci. 89: 851-863. To study DNA methylation polymorphism in soybean, 20 and 27 lines of annual wild and cultivated soybeans, respectively, were selected from previously established ""Soybean Core Collections in China"", and subjected to methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analysis. Twenty-seven primer pairs generated 984 CG/CNG methylation sites across the 47 lines, and the data were dissected into methylation-sensitive (MS) and methylation- insensitive(MIS) polymorphisms. The calculated MSP vs. MISP for wild soybeans were 34.65 vs. 34.76%, while corresponding results for the cultivated soybeans were 47.05 vs. 47.15%, indicating higher levels of MSP and MISP in cultivated than in wild soybeans. These results were incongruent with the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of the same soybean lines, and suggested enhanced DNA methylation polymorphism due to human selection. All three markers, MSP, MISP and AFLP, enabled clustering of the soybean lines into two distinct groups each predominantly containing wild or cultivated ones. Homology search indicated that 12 out of 24 sequenced MSPs had significant similarities to known-function or predicated genes, suggesting possible functional relevance of the methylation polymorphism. No significant association between MSP and MISP or MSP and AFLP was detected. Our results suggest thatDNAmethylation polymorphism in soybean has been under both natural and human selections, implicating possible roles of this epigenetic modification in genome evolution and domestication.","Annual wild soybean (Glycine soja); Cultivated soybean (G. max); DNA methylation polymorphism; Domestication; Epigenetic variation; Evolution","cultivar; DNA; evolution; genetic marker; homology; methylation; natural selection; plant breeding; polymorphism; soybean; transgenic plant; wild population; Glycine max; Glycine soja","Zhong, X.; Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of MOE, , Changchun 130024, China",,,00084220,,CPLSA,,"English","Can.

Background. mPing is an endogenous MITE in the rice genome, which is quiescent under normal conditions but can be induced towards mobilization under various stresses. The cellular mechanism responsible for modulating the activity of mPing remains unknown. Cytosine methylation is a major epigenetic modification in most eukaryotes, and the primary function of which is to serve as a genome defense system including taming activity of transposable elements (TEs). Given that tissue-culture is capable of inducing both methylation alteration and mPing transposition in certain rice genotypes, it provides a tractable system to investigate the possible relationship between the two phenomena. Results. mPing transposition and cytosine methylation alteration were measured in callus and regenerated plants in three rice (ssp. indica) genotypes, V14, V27 and R09. All three genotypes showed transposition of mPing, though at various frequencies. Cytosine methylation alteration occurred both at the mPing-flanks and at random loci sampled globally in callus and regenerated plants of all three genotypes. However, a sharp difference in the changing patterns was noted between the mPing-flanks and random genomic loci, with a particular type of methylation modification, i.e., CNG hypermethylation, occurred predominantly at the mPing-flanks. Pearson's test on pairwise correlations indicated that mPing activity is positively correlated with specific patterns of methylation alteration at random genomic loci, while the element's immobility is positively correlated with methylation levels of the mPing's 5'-flanks. Bisulfite sequencing of two mPing-containing loci showed that whereas for the immobile locus loss of CG methylation in the 5'-flank was accompanied by an increase in CHG methylation, together with an overall increase in methylation of all three types (CG, CHG and CHH) in the mPing-body region, for the active locus erasure of CG methylation in the 5'-flank was not followed by such a change. Conclusion. Our results documented that tissue culture-induced mPing activity in rice ssp. indica is correlated with alteration in cytosine methylation patterns at both random genomic loci and the elements' flanks, while the stability of mPing positively correlates with enhanced methylation levels of both the flanks and probably the elements per se. Thus, our results implicate a possible role of cytosine methylation in maintaining mPing stability under normal conditions, and in releasing the element's activity as a consequence of epigenetic perturbation in a locus-specific manner under certain stress conditions. © 2009 Ngezahayo et al.",,"Eukaryota; cytosine; plant DNA; article; DNA methylation; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; genotype; metabolism; rice; tissue culture technique; transposon; Cytosine; DNA Methylation; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Plant; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genotype; Oryza sativa; Tissue Culture Techniques","Liu, B.; Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of MOE, , Changchun 130024, China; эл. почта: baoliu@nenu.edu.cn",,,14712229,,,"19604382","English","BMC Plant Biol.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-68349154098

To apply the model to identify surveillance protocols for generalized invasion scenarios and for evaluating surveillance and control for a context-specific plant invasion. Location Australia. Methods We integrate a spatially explicit simulation model, including plant demography and dispersal vectors, within a Geographical Information System. We use the model to identify effective surveillance protocols using simulations of generalized plant life-forms spreading via different dispersal mechanisms in real landscapes. We then parameterize the surveillance support model for Chilean needle grass [CNG; Nassella neesiana (Trin. & Rupr.) Barkworth], a highly invasive tussock grass, which is an eradication target in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. Results General surveillance protocols that can guide rapid response surveillance were identified; suitable habitat that is susceptible to invasion through particular dispersal syndromes should be targeted for surveillance using an adaptive seek-and-destroy method. The search radius of the adaptive method should be based on maximum expected dispersal distances. Protocols were used to define a surveillance strategy for CNG, but simulations indicated that despite effective and targeted surveillance, eradication is implausible at current intensities. Main conclusions Several important surveillance protocols emerged and simulations indicated that effectiveness can be increased if they are followed in rapid response surveillance. If sufficient data are available, the surveillance support model should be parameterized to target areas susceptible to invasion and determine whether surveillance is effective and eradication is feasible. We discovered that for CNG, regardless of a carefully designed surveillance strategy, eradication is implausible at current intensities of surveillance and control and these efforts should be doubled if they are to be successful. This is crucial information in the face of environmentally and economically damaging invasive species and large, expensive and potentially ineffective control programmes. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biological invasions; Dispersal; Eradication; Seek-and-destroy; Simulation; Surveillance","computer simulation; environmental degradation; GIS; grass; invasive species; landscape structure; parameterization; tussock grassland; weed control; Australasia; Australia; Queensland; Nassella neesiana","Fox, J.

In total, 71 different sequences were obtained, which, according to alignment and phylogenetic analysis, can be classified into seven distinct families, with five each containing multiple sequences and two each containing a single sequence. The nucleotide sequence similarity values varied widely among the sequences, indicative of their high degree of heterogeneity. Of the 71 sequences, 25 are intact whereas the others have a frame-shift, a stop codon, or both. Southern blot analysis revealed differential occurrence of the Z. latifolia copia retrotransposons among representative species of the grass family, and upon which three groups (I, II and III) can be divided. An interesting observation is that whereas the occurrence patterns of groups I and II among the grass species is compatible with their organismal phylogeny, which of group III shows apparent incongruity. Because cytosine methylation has been proposed as a major mechanism controlling transpositional behavior, amplification, and hence distribution, of mobile elements, the extent and pattern of this epigenetic modification were analyzed for the Zizania copia retrotransposons. Southern blotting with a pair of isoschizomers, HpaII and MspI, with differential sensitivity to cytosine methylation revealed an atypical methylation pattern of the Z. latifolia copia retrotransposons. It was found that only two of the seven families (families 1 and 4) showed typical methylation patterns as found in other plants, i.e., CG is more heavily methylated than CNG, while the rest five families showed an atypical pattern, i.e., CNG is more methylated than CG, which was further verified by using the Z. latifolia copia-mixture as a probe. In addition, the homologues of those Z. latifolia copia elements that exist in both cultivated rice and the common wild rice are largely undermethylated and highly conserved, though some of which showed evidence for methylation alteration in several rice-Zizania introgression lines. Thus, the atypical patterns of cytosine methylation of the copia retrotransposons in Z. latifolia might have played a role in their differentiation into distinct groups, and differential occurrence of their homologs in other species of the grass family. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose the use of CNG drive trains in high alpine areas is an interesting alternative to the standard diesel technology. The same SUV with CNG and diesel powertrain has been measured and methodically compared with regard to fuel consumption and exhaust emission performance. These real-world measurements have shown the potential when applying a CNG concept for this utilization. Subsequently, the real-world on-board measurements were compared with the results of a simulation program for SUV off-road performance.

The method was applied to plan transportation means delivery routes according to a specifi ed target criterion, which may be e.g. minimisation of costs, time, or energy consumption. It was assumed in the presented system that the length of delivery routes will be minimised for the transportation means participating in accomplishing of the delivery task. Adopting such a target function leads in practice also to minimisation of costs, time, and energy consumption. A lower number of kilometres driven means less consumed fuel and other operating materials, decreased technical wear of vehicles, shorter drivers' work time, and thus also a decrease of the costs spent. Dividing transportation means, on the basis of simulation analysis for each day of purchasing period, a decision can be made to buy or rent them, i.e. to specify transportation self-sufficiency of an enterprise. The effects of the program work have shown that the application of the suggested system in the analysed year would shorten the total length of the distance covered by trucks participating in the raspberry purchasing campaign for the cold stores by 9%. Improvement of vehicle work efficiency renders measurable amounts, which decrease the product manufacturing costs and increase its marketing competitiveness.","Delivery optimisation; Raspberries; Transportation in agriculture",,"Marczuk, A.; Katedra Maszyn i Urzadzeń Rolniczych, Ul.

In order to reach national CO 2 emission reduction targets as formulated in the Kyoto agreement increased bio fuel shares are considered. Thus a fuel blend with a share of 10% bio fuel was investigated in high efficient propulsions systems. The measurements were conducted with reference fuels and reference fuel blended with a bio fuel share of 10%. For the test drives representative routes of 77 km total length in the area of Vienna were defined, which include sections with significantly different driving conditions. Furthermore test drives at different constant speeds on freeway sections were carried out. So gained measurement results were therefore based on thousands of detailed measurements sets, which were averagely weighted. The chosen test vehicles were equipped with the new ultra compact On-Board Measurement System (OBM) to determine the exhaust mass emissions in real time. The measurement method is based on modal analysis of the emission concentrations in the tailpipe of the vehicle. For the investigations in real world traffic two premium class SUVs, one with a Diesel engine and automatic transmission and one with a gasoline hybrid system were chosen. It is to state in general that the CO 2 and pollutant emissions were dependant on the propulsion system of the vehicle. For the hybrid SUV in comparison to the SUV with Diesel engine and automatic gearbox, 30% lower CO 2 emissions on city routes were measured. The nitrous oxide emissions of the different propulsion systems were determined in detail as well. The application of the fuel blend in the different vehicles and propulsion systems with 10% bio fuel share, lead to diversified results. On city routes a reduction in CO 2 emissions in the conventional propulsion system was observed, whereas for the hybrid vehicle an increase was measured. On freeway routes the results were the other way round, the fuel consumption of the Diesel SUV increased. The fuel consumption of the hybrid SUV was slightly decreased. In full load tests, the gasoline hybrid vehicle showed lowered acceleration performance and the Diesel powered SUV increased CO 2 emissions.","Bio fuels; Real-world measurement; SUV","Acceleration performance; Automatic gearboxes; Automatic transmission; Constant speed; Conventional fuel; Conventional propulsion; Driving conditions; Emission concentration; Emission reduction; Exhaust mass; Fuel blends; Full-load; Kyoto agreements; Light duty vehicles; Measurement methods; Measurement results; Nitrous oxide emissions; On-board measurements; Pollutant emission; Propulsion system; Real time; Real-world emission; SUV; Test drive; Test vehicle; Total length; Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Emission control; Gasoline; Hybrid systems; Hybrid vehicles; Land vehicle propulsion; Modal analysis; Nitrogen oxides; Fuels","Pucher, E.; Vienna University of Technology, Gußhausstrasse 27-29/315, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,"English","FISITA World Automot.

Natural gas (NG) is a largely available fossil fuel and therefore non-renewable. However, NG has some advantages compared to gasoline and diesel from an environmental perspective. Its emissions are lower. The low flame temperature of lean operated CNG engines helps to limit the formation of NO x. Furthermore, since NG contains only 75 wt% carbon versus 86-88 wt% for gasoline or diesel, it produces less CO 2 per unit of energy released. Furthermore, soot particulate can hardly be formed from methane combustion. Other benefits lie in the fact that NG is neither toxic, carcinogenic, nor caustic. However, unconverted methane in CNG flue gases is much harder to oxidise than gasoline-derived unburned hydrocarbons (UHC). The strong greenhouse effect of methane (more than one order of magnitude higher than that of CO 2) forces a higher and higher concern at a legislation level and, as a consequence, the development of new after-treatment technologies to abate these emissions. Catalytic combustion of methane on honeycomb converters similar to those used for the treatment of gasoline engine exhaust gases is the way to go. Commercial catalysts are mostly based on gamma-Al 2O 3-supported Pd, having a at least three fold higher noble metal loading compared to mat of conventional three-way catalysts (up to 300 g/ft 3 against 80 g/ft 3). A research line of ours is aimed at developing nanostructured Pd-perovskite-type-oxide catalysts employing an overall noble metal load significantly smaller than that used in conventional converters, the catalytic performance being the same. Several perovskite-type oxide catalysts (LaMn03, LaMn 09Pd O.iO 3, LaFeO 3, LaFeo.9Pd 01O 3, LaCrO 3, LaCr 09Pd 0.103) were prepared by SCS, characterized, and tested as catalysts for methane combustion. The comparative analysis of the catalysts activity was carried out with pure perovskites in powder. The best catalyst was found to be LaMn 0.9Pd 0.1O 3 (T 50 = 425°C) and therefore it was selected to be deposited on a cordierite monolith in a γ-Al 2O 3 supported form (catalyst weight percentage 15%) and tested in a lab-scale test rig under realistic conditions. Half methane conversion (T 50) was achieved at 340°C (GHSV = 10 000 h -1), nearly the same T 50 value but with a six-fold lower amount of the expensive noble metal than that used in commercial 4wt% Pd/γ-Al 2O 3 catalysts.","CNG; Combustion; Methane; Pcrovskite; Pd","After-treatment technology; Catalytic combustion of methane; Catalytic performance; CNG; CNG engine; Commercial catalyst; Comparative analysis; Conventional gasoline; Cordierite monolith; Flame temperatures; Gasoline engines; Methane combustion; Methane conversions; Methane emissions; Nano-structured; Noble metal loading; Non-renewable; Pcrovskite; Per unit; Perovskite type oxides; Realistic conditions; Soot particulates; Substitution effect; Supported Pd; Test rigs; Three way catalysts; Unburned hydrocarbons; Weight percentages; Aluminum; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Combustion; Diesel engines; Exhaust systems (engine); Flue gases; Fossil fuels; Gasoline; Greenhouse effect; Methane; Palladium; Perovskite; Precious metals; Catalyst activity","Russo, N.; Politecnico di TorinoItaly",,,,,,,"English","FISITA World Automot.

Plants from temperate regions are able to withstand freezing temperatures due to a process known as cold acclimation, which is a prior exposure to low, but non-freezing temperatures. During acclimation, a large number of genes are induced, bringing about biochemical changes in the plant, thought to be responsible for the subsequent increase in freezing tolerance. Key regulatory proteins in this process are the CBF1, 2 and 3 transcription factors which control the expression of a set of target genes referred to as the ""CBF regulon"". Results. To assess the role of the CBF genes in cold acclimation and freezing tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana, the CBF genes and their promoters were sequenced in the Versailles core collection, a set of 48 accessions that maximizes the naturally-occurring genetic diversity, as well as in the commonly used accessions Col-0 and WS. Extensive polymorphism was found in all three genes. Freezing tolerance was measured in all accessions to assess the variability in acclimated freezing tolerance. The effect of sequence polymorphism was investigated by evaluating the kinetics of CBF gene expression, as well as that of a subset of the target COR genes, in a set of eight accessions with contrasting freezing tolerance. Our data indicate that CBF genes as well as the selected COR genes are cold induced in all accessions, irrespective of their freezing tolerance. Although we observed different levels of expression in different accessions, CBF or COR gene expression was not closely correlated with freezing tolerance. Conclusion. Our results indicate that the Versailles core collection contains significant natural variation with respect to freezing tolerance, polymorphism in the CBF genes and CBF and COR gene expression. Although there tends to be more CBF and COR gene expression in tolerant accessions, there are exceptions, reinforcing the idea that a complex network of genes is involved in freezing tolerance and that the CBF genes alone cannot explain all differences in phenotype. Our study also highlights the difficulty in assessing the function of single transcription factors that are members of closely related gene families. © 2008 McKhann et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Arabidopsis protein; CBF1 protein, Arabidopsis; CBF2 protein, Arabidopsis; DREB1A protein, Arabidopsis; plant DNA; transactivator protein; transcription factor; acclimatization; Arabidopsis; article; cold; freezing; gene; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; phenotype; polymerase chain reaction; promoter region; regulon; sequence alignment; single nucleotide polymorphism; Acclimatization; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cold; DNA, Plant; Freezing; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Phenotype; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Regulon; Sequence Alignment; Trans-Activators; Transcription Factors","McKhann, H.

These blends offer a valid opportunity for tackling sustainable transportation, in view of the future stringent emission limits for road vehicles. Air pollution is particularly suffered in large urban areas, where cars and heavy duty vehicles greatly contribute to total emissions. Hydrogen is a very interesting energy vector for road transportation, however long time would be required to implement new refuelling infrastructures and new engines or power train systems capable to use hydrogen as fuel. Thus such blends could be employed since now without any important changes in both the distribution infrastructures and engine fuel systems of the current natural gas vehicles. The aim of the paper is the investigation of the effects of hydrogen-natural gas blends on performance and efficiency of a spark ignition internal combustion engine. The activity evaluates the influence of hydrogen content in blends (ranging from 10% to 30% in volume) on flame propagation speed and heat release rates using an internal combustion engine model. Two different approaches have been used for ignition timing, cither employing a Maximum Brake Torque (MBT) spark timing for each fuel or retaining the spark advance of the natural gas engine. Engine brake efficiency increments ranged between 2% and 4.5% for different blends and load conditions adopting MBT ignition timing. Actual running fuel costs were observed to increases 8% for HCNG 10 and 29% for HCNG 30 when compared to CNG using MBT ignition timing.","Combustion model; Flame speed; Hydrogen; Internal combustion engine; Natural gas","Automobile engines; Brakes; Combustion equipment; Fossil fuels; Fuel pumps; Gas emissions; Gas engines; Hydrogen; Ignition; Internal combustion engines; Natural gas; Pollution; Roads and streets; Combustion model; Flame propagation speed; Flame speed; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Heavy duty vehicles; Maximum brake torques; Road transportation; Sustainable transportation; Natural gas vehicles","Unich, A.; Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, Italy",,"Springer Automotive Media",,,,,"English","FISITA World Automot.

The evaluation focuses on the energy balance, co-products, and tailpipe emissions of the fuels. Biomethane from the anaerobic digestion of crops was found to have a more favorable energy balance for the production of transport fuel than biodiesel or bioethanol (maximum 237 011 MJ/ha compared to 24 185 and 77 264 MJ/ha, respectively). Tailpipe emissions were superior for methane with lower emission levels of CO, CO2, and particulates and lower NOx levels than biodiesel but comparable to bioethanol. To make the most efficient use of the limited land available for production of biofuels, it is recommended that further development of gaseous biofuels, such as biomethane and biohydrogen, are encouraged.

C. elegans, however, is generally believed to lack phototaxis, as this animal lives in darkness (soil) and does not possess eyes. Here, we found that light stimuli elicited negative phototaxis in C. elegans and that this behavior is important for survival. We identified a group of ciliary sensory neurons as candidate photoreceptor cells for mediating phototaxis. Furthermore, we found that light excited photoreceptor cells by evoking a depolarizing conductance carried by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-sensitive cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, revealing a conservation in phototransduction between worms and vertebrates. These results identify a new sensory modality in C. elegans and suggest that animals living in dark environments without light-sensing organs may not be presumed to be light insensitive. We propose that urbilaterians, the last common ancestor of bilaterians, might have already evolved a visual system that employs CNG channels and the second messenger cGMP for phototransduction. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.",,"cyclic GMP; cyclic nucleotide; article; Caenorhabditis elegans; environmental factor; nonhuman; photoreceptor cell; photostimulation; phototaxis; phototransduction; priority journal; sensory nerve cell; survival; vertebrate; worm; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Cyclic GMP; Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels; Diltiazem; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Enzyme Inhibitors; Guanylate Cyclase; Ion Channels; Light; Motor Activity; Neurons, Afferent; Paralysis; Patch-Clamp Techniques; Phototransduction; Ultraviolet Rays","Xu, X.

Although a cytokinin-binding activity had been hypothesized for SAHH, the relation between cytokinin and transmethylation reactions has not been elucidated. Here we show that, of the two Arabidopsis thaliana SAHH genes, AtSAHH1 has a much higher expression level than AtSAHH2. A T-DNA insertion mutant of AtSAHH1 (sahh1-1) and the RNA interference (RNAi) plants (dsAtSAHH2) accumulated a higher level of cytokinins, exhibited phenotypic changes similar to those of cytokinin-overproducers, and their global DNA methylation status was reduced. On the other hand, cytokinins positively regulate the transmethylation pathway genes, including AtSAHH1, AtADK1 (for adenosine kinase), and this regulation involves the cytokinin activity. Furthermore, expression of three cytosine DNA methyltransferase genes examined was inducible by cytokinin treatment. Unlike adenine and adenosine which are SAHH inhibitors, the adenine-type cytokinins have no effect on SAHH activity at protein level. Changing of endogenous cytokinin levels by transgene expression resulted in alterations of DNA methylation status in the sahh1-1 background, suggesting that cytokinins promote DNA methylation, at least under transmethylation stringent conditions. These data demonstrate that the phytohormone cytokinin plays a role in promoting transmethylation reactions, including DNA methylation. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Arabidopsis; Cytokinin; DNA methylation; S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase","adenosine kinase; adenosylhomocysteinase; Arabidopsis protein; cytokinin; phytohormone; Arabidopsis; article; DNA methylation; down regulation; drug effect; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetics; high performance liquid chromatography; metabolism; physiology; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; transgenic plant; Adenosine Kinase; Adenosylhomocysteinase; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cytokinins; DNA Methylation; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Growth Regulators; Plants, Genetically Modified; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Interference; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana","Chen, X.-Y.; National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China; эл. почта: xychen@sibs.ac.cn",,,00320935,,PLANA,"18350315","English","Planta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44149121654

The sophistication and interaction of these systems permit precise detection of food, danger, and mates, all crucial elements for survival. In most mammals, the nose contains two well described chemosensory apparatuses (the main olfactory epithelium and the vomeronasal organ), each of which comprises several subtypes of sensory neurons expressing distinct receptors and signal transduction machineries. In many species (e.g., rodents), the nasal cavity also includes two spatially segregated clusters of neurons forming the septal organ of Masera and the Grueneberg ganglion. Results of recent studies suggest that these chemosensory systems perceive diverse but overlapping olfactory cues and that some neurons may even detect the pressure changes carried by the airflow. This review provides an update on how chemosensory neurons transduce chemical (and possibly mechanical) stimuli into electrical signals, and what information each system brings into the brain. Future investigation will focus on the specific ligands that each system detects with a behavioral context and the processing networks that each system involves in the brain. Such studies will lead to a better understanding of how the multiple olfactory systems, acting in concert, offer a complete representation of the chemical world.

Their activity towards the combustion of methane was evaluated in a temperature programmed combustion microreactor. The LaMn0.9Fe0.1O3 catalyst was found to provide the best performance. The half-conversion temperature of methane over the LaMn0.9Fe0.1O3 catalyst was 398 °C with a W/F = 0.12 g s/cm3 and a methane feed concentration of 0.4 vol% under oxygen excess. Via temperature programmed oxygen desorption (TPD) analysis as well as catalytic combustion runs, the prevalent activity of the LaMn0.9Fe0.1O3 catalyst could be explained by its higher and increased capability to desorb suprafacial, weakly chemisorbed oxygen species. Further catalyst development allowed to maximise the catalytic activity of this compound by promoting it with CeO2 (1:1 molar ratio) and with 1 wt% Pd. This promoted catalyst was lined on cordierite monoliths in a γ-Al2O3-supported form (catalyst weight percentage: 15 wt%) and then tested in a lab-scale test rig under realistic conditions for compressed natural gas-vehicles' exhaust gas treatment. Half methane conversion was achieved at 340 °C (gas high space velocity = 10 000 h-1), nearly the same but with a fourfold lower amount of the expensive noble metal than that used in commercial 4wt%Pd-γ-Al2O3 catalysts. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In maize, the P1-wr allele of pericarp color1 is composed of multiple copies arranged in a head-to-tail fashion. P1-wr confers a white kernel pericarp and red cob glume pigment phenotype that is stably inherited over generations. To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate tissue-specific expression of P1-wr, we have characterized P1-wr*, a spontaneous loss-of-function epimutation that shows a white kernel pericarp and white cob glume phenotype. As compared to its progenitor P1-wr, the P1-wr* is hypermethylated in exon 1 and intron 2 regions. In the presence of the epigenetic modifier Ufo1 (Unstable factor for orange1), P1-wr* plants exhibit a range of cob glume pigmentation whereas pericarps remain colorless. In these plants, the level of cob pigmentation directly correlates with the degree of DNA demethylation in the intron 2 region of p1. Further, genomic bisulfite sequencing indicates that a 168-bp region of intron 2 is significantly hypomethylated in both CG and CNG context in P1-wr* Ufo1 plants. Interestingly, P1-wr* Ufo1 plants did not show any methylation change in a distal enhancer region that has previously been implicated in Ufo1-induced gain of pericarp pigmentation of the P1-wr allele. These results suggest that distinct regulatory sequences in the P1-wr promoter and intron 2 regions can undergo independent epigenetic modifications to generate tissue-specific expression patterns.

The CNG repeat containing transcripts were shown to belong to moderate and low abundance classes. The CNG repeat regions in transcripts may form hairpin structures of different molecular architecture.

The activity of these catalysts towards the combustion of methane was evaluated in a temperature-programmed combustion (TPC) apparatus. Spinel-type-oxides containing Cr at the B site were found to provide the best results. The half-conversion temperature of methane over the CoCr2O4 catalyst was 376 °C with a W/F = 0.12 g s/cm-3. On the basis of temperature-programmed oxygen desorption (TPD) analysis as well as of catalytic combustion runs, the prevalent activity of the CoCr2O4 catalyst could be explained by its higher capability to deliver suprafacial, weakly chemisorbed oxygen species. This catalyst, promoted by the presence of 1 wt% of palladium deposited by wet impregnation, was lined on cordierite monoliths and then tested in a lab-scale test rig. The combination of Pd and CoCr2O4 catalysts enables half methane conversion at 330 °C (GHSV = 10,000 h-1), a performance similar to that of conventional 4 wt% Pd-γ-Al2O3 catalysts but enabled with just a four-fold lower amount of noble metal. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Total PCB concentrations ranged from 3.4 to 94 cng/g dw. The highest value was found in oysters from the Lu'ermen aquaculture area, which receives wastewater from a sodium hydroxide and pentachlorophenol factory.

In fact, flash floods, generated by very intense rainfall, occur not only in autumn and winter, but at the end of summer as well. These calamities are amplified by peculiar geological and geomorphological characteristics of Salento and by the pollution of sinkholes. Floodings affect often large areas, especially in the impermeable lowering zones. These events cause warnings and emergency states, involving people as well as socio-economic goods. A methodical investigation based on the historic flood records and an analysis of the geoenvironmental factors have been performed, using a Geographic Information System (GIS) methodology for database processing in order to identify the distribution of areas with different risk degrees. The data, referring to events that occurred from 1968 to 2004, have been collected in a database, the so-called IPHAS (Salento Alluvial PHenomena Inventory), extracted in an easily consultable table. The final goal is the development of a risk map where the areas that are affected by floodings are included between small ridges, the so-called ""Serre"". More than 50% of the Salento peninsula shows high or very high risk values. The numerous maps that were utilized and generated represent an important basis in order to quantify the flood risk, according to the model using historic records.

To study possible epigenetic mechanism controlling activity of Tos17, we subjected three rice lines (the parental line cv. Matsumae and two introgression lines, RZ2 and RZ35) that harbor different copies of the element to tissue culture. For each line, we investigated transcription and transposition of Tos17 in seed plants, calli and regenerated plants, cytosine-methylation status at CG and CNG positions within Tos17, effect of 5-azacytidine on methylation status and activity of Tos17, and cytosine-methylation states in genomic regions flanking original and some newly transposed copies of Tos17 in calli and regenerated plants. We found that only in introgression line RZ35 was Tos17 transcriptionally activated and temporarily mobilized by tissue culture, which was followed by repression before or upon plant regeneration. The activity and inactivity of Tos17 in calli and regenerated plants of RZ35 are accompanied by hypo- and hyper-CG methylation and hemi- and full CNG methylation, respectively, within the element, whereas immobilization of the element in the other two lines is concomitant with near-constant, full hypermethylation. Treatment with 5-azacytidine induced both CG and CNG partial hypomethylation of Tos17 in two lines (Matsumae and RZ35), which, however, was not accompanied by activation of Tos17 in any line. Heritable alteration in cytosine-methylation patterns occurred in three of seven genomic regions flanking Tos17 in calli and regenerated plants of RZ35, but in none of the five regions flanking dormant Tos17 in the other two lines. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Chemical activation; Crops; Plants (botany); Tissue culture; Epigenetic mechanism; Methylation; Rice; Genetic engineering; azacitidine; cytosine; primer DNA; article; comparative study; DNA methylation; DNA probe; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; metabolism; Northern blotting; retroposon; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rice; Southern blotting; Azacitidine; Blotting, Northern; Blotting, Southern; Cytosine; DNA Methylation; DNA Primers; DNA Probes; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation; Oryza sativa; Retroelements; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Spermatophyta","Liu, B.; Laboratory of Epigenetics, , 130024 Changchun, China; эл. почта: baoliu@nenu.edu.cn",,,00405752,,THAGA,"15071728","English","Theor.

Many of these urban centers are expanding rapidly, leading to the growth of megacities, which are often defined as metropolitan areas with populations exceeding 10 million inhabitants. These concentrations of people and activity are exerting increasing stress on the natural environment, with impacts at urban, regional and global levels. In recent decades, air pollution has become one of the most important problems of megacities. Initially, the main air pollutants of concern were sulfur compounds, which were generated mostly by burning coal. Today, photochemical smog—induced primarily from traffic, but also from industrial activities, power generation, and solvents—has become the main source of concern for air quality, while sulfur is still a major problem in many cities of the developing world. Air pollution has serious impacts on public health, causes urban and regional haze, and has the potential to contribute significantly to global climate change. Yet, with appropriate planning megacities can efficiently address their air quality problems through measures such as application of new emission control technologies and development of mass transit systems. This review is focused on nine urban centers, chosen as case studies to assess air quality from distinct perspectives: from cities in the industrialized nations to cities in the developing world. This review considers not only megacities, but also urban centers with somewhat smaller populations, for while each city—its problems, resources, and outlook—is unique, the need for a holistic approach to complex environmental problems is the same. There is no single strategy to reduce air pollution in megacities; a mix of policy measures will be needed to improve air quality. Experience shows that strong political will coupled with public dialogue is essential to effectively implement the regulations required to address air quality. © 2004 Air and Waste Management Association.",,,"Molina, L.T.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; эл. почта: ltmolina@mit.edu",,,10962247,,,,"English","J.

The fermentation capabilities of lactic acid bacteria can be severely inhibited by a panoply of nonviral inhibitors, such as bacteriocins, nisin, residues from antibiotic or disinfectant treatments, or the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide system present in raw milk. However, the major commercial problem results from bacteriophage infections. These bacterial viruses were identified as filter-transmissible agents by the work of Twort in 1915 and d’Hérelle in 1917.[1] Their submicroscopic sperm-like morphology remained undetected until the first electron microscopes became available during the 1940s. Phages attacking Lactococcus lactis have been known since the 1930s, when Whitehead and Cox in New Zealand observed that phages were responsible for the failure in the acid-producing activity of a cheese starter culture.[2] In the area of food fermentation, the permanent threat of phage infection is particularly manifested in the dairy field. Here, phage attacks on lactic acid bacteria during the fermentation process result in an unacceptably low production of lactic acid and flavor compounds along with reduced proteolysis. Thus, starter activity is either severely affected (“slow vats”) or, in extreme cases, a complete failure of starter growth may occur (“dead vats”). Due to the constant risk of economic loss, phage control is a major area of concern in handling lactic acid bacteria as starter cultures. Phages have also been isolated from other fermentations, e.g., in the production of sauerkraut, coffee, and wine, but most often these attacks are not as destructive as in milk fermentation. These worldwide efforts focus on the understanding of the complex and dynamic mechanisms of phage-host relationships, including (a) the characterization of the phage population involved, including genomics analysis, (b) the analysis of “natural” and “intelligent” bacterial systems of phage defense, and (c) the identification of phage counterdefense mechanisms. © 2004 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

Theoretical and empirical inquiries by regional scientists have progressively begun to address the manifold environmental ramifications of regional science questions. As such, there now exists a sizeable literature on what we may call the environment in regional science. Given this state of affairs, the purpose of this article is to survey this extensive literature. To provide sufficient focus, we do this by discussing five key issues in the extant literature on the environment in regional science. These issues are: (i) regional economic development, (ii) environmental regulation, (iii) natural resources, (iv) international affairs, and (v) geographic information systems. Our survey is both retrospective and prospective in nature. We are interested not only in what has been accomplished thus far but also in where research on the environment in regional science is headed in the future. © Springer-Verlag Berlin/Heidelberg 2003.","Environmental regulation; Geographic information system; International affairs; Natural resources; Regional economic development","academic research; GIS; literature review; regional geography","Batabyal, A.A.; Department of Economics, 92 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, NY 14623-5604, United States; эл. почта: aabgsh@rit.edu",,"Springer Verlag",10568190,,,,"English","Pap.

Analysis of the prophages suggested that after being integrated into bacterial genomes, they undergo a complex decay process consisting of inactivating point mutations, genome rearrangements, modular exchanges, invasion by further mobile DNA elements, and massive DNA deletion. We review the technical difficulties in defining such altered prophage sequences in bacterial genomes and discuss theoretical frameworks for the phage-bacterium interaction at the genomic level. The published genome sequences from three groups of eubacteria (low- and high-G + C gram-positive bacteria and γ-proteobacteria) were screened for prophage sequences. The prophages from Streptococcus pyogenes served as test case for theoretical predictions of the role of prophages in the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. The genomes from further human, animal, and plant pathogens, as well as commensal and free-living bacteria, were included in the analysis to see whether the same principles of prophage genomics apply for bacteria living in different ecological niches and coming from distinct phylogenetical affinities.

Tithonia and fertilizers were applied separately or combined in different proportions to give equal rates of 165 kg N ha-1, 15.5 kg P ha-1 and 155 kg K ha-1 in two consecutive maize growing seasons, followed by two residual maize crops. Maize grain yields and P recovered in the above-ground biomass were higher in the pure Tithonia than the pure fertilizer treatments. Maize yields increased with increasing proportions of Tithonia in the mixed treatments. When less than 36% of the P applied in the mixture was supplied by Tithonia, there was no additional yield benefit in the combined treatments compared to the pure fertilizer treatments. However an added value ranging from 18 to 24% in yield was observed at greater Tithonia proportions. Economic returns were greater when Tithonia was applied alone than when fertilizers were used, with a larger profit when Tithonia was collected from existing niches than when produced on site. Collecting Tithonia from current niches resulted also in larger net returns for all the combined treatments compared to the fertilizer treatments. The results of this study indicate that a high quality organic residue such as Tithonia can increase maize production to a greater extent than fertilizers. In low input systems, the combination of Tithonia and fertilizers is a valuable alternative when resources are scarce and an added benefit can be obtained by maximizing the proportion of Tithonia in the mixture.","Economic returns; Green manuring; Maize; Phosphorus recovery; Relative agronomic effectiveness","fertilizer application; green manuring; maize; phosphorus; soil fertility; Kenya; Tithonia; Tithonia diversifolia; Zea mays","Nziguheba, G.; Department of Soil Science, Private Bag X1, 7602 Matieland, South Africa",,,01674366,,AGSYE,,"English","Agrofor.

We use the term exbodied emissions for these full fuel-cycle emissions. The fuels examined are low sulfur diesel (LSD), ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULS), compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol (from lignocellulose), biodiesel and waste oil. Biodiesel and ethanol have the lowest exbodied greenhouse gas emissions (in grams greenhouse gases per kilometre travelled). Biodiesel reduces exbodied greenhouse gas emissions from 41% to 51% whereas ethanol reduces emissions by 49-55%. In fact, both emit larger quantities of CO2 than conventional fuels, but as most of the CO2 is from renewable carbon stocks that fraction is not counted towards the greenhouse gas emissions from the fuel. The gaseous fuels (LPG, CNG) come next with emissions that range from 88% to 92% of diesel. The emissions of greenhouse gases from diesel are reduced if waste oil is used as a diesel extender, but the processing energy required to generate LSD and ULS in Australia increase their greenhouse gas emissions compared to diesel fuel. The extra energy required liquefy and cool LNG means that it has the highest exbodied greenhouse gas emissions of the fuels that were considered. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Genetic mapping in a recombinant inbred (RI) population showed that polymorphisms attributable to different methylation states of PstI sites were abundant, and generally appeared to be stably inherited, although occasional failures of the inheritance of methylation states have been found. Assessments of genetic diversity by AFLP and SDAFLP were in general agreement with each other and with the currently accepted phylogeny of Pisum, but within cultivated groups the number of differences appeared to be exaggerated by AFLP.

To explore the possibility that cytosine residues that do not precede guanine may be independently methylated in mammalian DNA, we have examined a region of the human myogenic gene, Myf-3, which is not targeted by the methylating system that methylates 5'-CG-3' dinucleotides. Our investigations have revealed cytosine methylation within the 5'-CCTGG-3' pentanucleotides specified by the 0.8-kb Myf-3 probe. We have also found that in DNA from neoplastic cells, in which 5'-CG-3' dinucleotides within Myf-3 become abnormally hypermethylated, cytosine residues within 5'-CCTGG-3' pentanucleotides are not methylated. Moreover, methylation of 5'-CCTGG-3' pentanucleotides was not detected within the closely related Myf-4 gene, which is normally 5'-CG-3' hypermethylated. These findings indicate the existence of a system that methylates 5'-CCTGG-3' pentanucleotides independently of the system that methylates cytosine residues within 5'-CG-3' dinucleotides.

Methylation maps are created by the comparison of bisulfite converted sequences with the untreated genomic sequence.

However, an alternative fuel for internal combustion trucks is increasingly attracting the attention of manufacturers and users. The new fuel is natural gas, which is very low in emissions when burnt, and is either stored in compressed form (200 bar) in pressurized containers (CNG) or, applying a new technology, refrigerated in liquid form (LNG - minus 160° Celsius) in thermostatic containers. Of the two types, LNG provides twice the energy density and lasts twice as long for the same tank volume.

There are two classes of methyltransferase in Arabidopsis; one has a carboxy-terminal methyltransferase domain fused to an amino-terminal regulatory domain and is similar to mammalian methyltransferases. The second class apparently lacks an amino-terminal domain and is less well conserved. Methylcytosine can occur at any cytosine residue, but it is likely that clonal transmission of methylation patterns only occurs for cytosines in strand-symmetrical sequences CpG and CpNpG. In plants, as in mammals, DNA methylation has dual roles in defense against invading DNA and transposable elements and in gene regulation.
