Research studies dating over the last half-century consistently demonstrate a decline in male fertility that is incompletely explained by obesity, known genetic causes, or diet and lifestyle changes alone. Human exposures have changed dramatically over the same time course as this fertility decline. Synthetic chemicals surround us. Some are benevolent; however, many are known to cause disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and impair spermatogenesis. More than 80,000 chemicals are registered with the United States National Toxicology Program and nearly 2,000 new chemicals are introduced each year. Many of these are known toxins, such as phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines, and organophosphate esters, and have been banned or significantly restricted by other countries as they carry known carcinogenic effects and are reproductively toxic. In the United States, many of these chemicals are still permissible in exposure levels known to cause reproductive harm. This contrasts to other chemical regulatory legislature, such as the European Union’s REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) regulations which are more comprehensive and restrictive. Quantification of these diverse exposures on an individual level has proven challenging, although forthcoming technologies may soon make this data available to consumers. Establishing causality and the proportion of idiopathic infertility attributable to environmental toxin exposures remains elusive, however, continued investigation, avoidance of exposure, and mitigation of risk is essential to our reproductive health. The aim of this review is to examine the literature linking changes in male fertility to some of the most common environmental exposures. Specifically, pesticides and herbicides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dibromochloropropane (DBCP), organophosphates and atrazine, endocrine disrupting compounds including plastic compounds phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), heavy metals, natural gas/oil, non-ionizing radiation, air and noise pollution, lifestyle factors including diet, obesity, caffeine use, smoking, alcohol and drug use, as well as commonly prescribed medications will be discussed. © Translational Andrology and Urology.

Organic wastes having a larger fraction of biodegradable constituents present a sustainable bioenergy source. It has been reported that the calorific value of biogas generated by anaerobic digestion (AD) is 21–25 MJ/m3 with the treatment which makes it an excellent replacement of natural gas and fossil fuels and can reduce more than 80% greenhouse gas emission to the surroundings. However, there are some limitations associated with the AD process for instance ammonia build-up at the first stage reduces the rate of hydrolysis of biomass, whereas, in the last stage it interferes with methane formation. Owing to special physicochemical properties such as high activity, high reactive surface area, and high specificity, tailor-made conductive nanoparticles can improve the performance of the AD process. In the AD process, H2 is used as an electron carrier, referred as mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET). Due to the diffusion limitation of these electron carriers, the MIET efficiency is relatively low that limits the methanogenesis. Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), which enables direct cell-to-cell electron transport between bacteria and methanogen, has been considered an alternative efficient approach to MIET that creates metabolically favorable conditions and results in faster conversion of organic acids and alcohols into methane. This paper discusses in detail the application of conductive nanoparticles to enhance the AD process efficiency. Interaction between microbes in anaerobic conditions for electron transfer with the help of CNPs is discussed. Application of a variety of conductive nanomaterials as an additive is discussed with their potential biogas production and treatment enhancement in the anaerobic digestion process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Anaerobic digestion; Conductive nanoparticles; Interspecies electron transfer; Zero-valent metals,Ammonia; Bacteria; Biogas; Biomass; Electron transitions; Electron transport properties; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Metal nanoparticles; Methane; Physicochemical properties; 'current; Anaerobic digestion process; Anaerobics; Conductive nanoparticles; Current status; Electron carrier; Electron transfer; Future perspectives; Interspecies electron transfer; Zero-valent metals; Anaerobic digestion; alternative energy; anaerobic digestion; bacterium; biodegradation; biogas; biomass; electron; fossil fuel; future prospect; ion exchange; methane; nanoparticle; natural gas; organic pollutant; physicochemical property,"Singh, L.; Department of Environmental Science, Amaravati, India; эл. почта: lucki.chem09@gmail.com",,Elsevier Ltd,00456535,,CMSHA,33945900.0,English,Chemosphere,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105010957

In most cases, olfactory dysfunction is accompanied by reduced sense of taste, is partial (microsmia) and seems to normalize after several weeks, however, especially in cases of virus-induced complete smell loss (anosmia), there are indications of persisting deficits even 2 months after recovery from the acute disease, pointing towards the possibility of chronic or even permanent smell reduction for a significant part of the patient population. To date, we have no knowledge on the specificity of anosmia towards specific odorants or chemicals and about the longer-term timeline of its persistence or reversal. Methods: In this longitudinal study, 70 participants from a community in Lower Austria that had been tested positive for either IgG or IgM SARS-CoV-2 titers in June 2020 and a healthy control cohort (N = 348) underwent smell testing with a 12-item Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT), based upon items from the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The test was performed in October 2020, i.e. 4 months after initial diagnosis via antibody testing. Results were analyzed using statistical tests for contingency for each smell individually in order to detect whether reacquisition of smell is dependent on specific odorant types. Results: For all odorants tested, except the odor “smoke”, even 4 months or more after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, participants with a positive antibody titer had a reduced sense of smell when compared to the control group. On average, while the control cohort detected a set of 12 different smells with 88.0% accuracy, the antibody-positive group detected 80.0% of tested odorants. A reduction of accuracy of detection by 9.1% in the antibody-positive cohort was detected. Recovery of the ability to smell was particularly delayed for three odorants: strawberry (encoded by the aldehyde ethylmethylphenylglycidate), lemon (encoded by citronellal, a monoterpenoid aldehyde), and soap (alkali metal salts of the fatty acids plus odorous additives) exhibit a sensitivity of detection of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 of 31.0%, 41.0% and 40.0%, respectively. Conclusion: Four months or more after acute infection, smell performance of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with mild or no symptoms is not fully recovered, whereby the ability to detect certain odors (strawberry, lemon and soap) is particularly affected, suggesting the possibility that these sensitivity to these smells may not only be lagging behind but may be more permanently affected. © 2021",Anosmia; COVID-19; Dysgeusia; Microsmia; SARS-CoV-2; Smell and taste dysfunction; Smell test,aldehyde derivative; aldehyde ethylmethylphenylglycidate; alkali metal; citronellal; fatty acid; fragrance; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; menthol; natural gas; soap; unclassified drug; adult; antibody detection; antibody titer; Article; Austria; cherry; clove; cohort analysis; community living; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 serological testing; Cross Cultural Smell Identification Test; female; human; lemon; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; odor; odor recognition test; pineapple; priority journal; rose; sensitivity analysis; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smelling disorder; smoke; strawberry; University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test,"Pfaffeneder-Mantai, F.; Danube Private University, Steiner Landstraße 124, Austria; эл. почта: Florian.Pfaffeneder@dp-uni.ac.at",,W.B.

Although computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations on preventing gas accidents on LNG-fueled ships and bunkering facilities have been carried out, research on evacuating humans in the event of disasters such as fire and explosion due to gas leakage has been insufficient. In this study, an algorithm was derived that considers the interaction between workers and gas accidents for evacuation to the open deck of a floating bunkering terminal, and a simulation platform was developed for visualizing gas accidents. The developed algorithm and simulation platform were applied to analyzing the evacuation characteristics considering both the gas accident and evacuation destination, and the results were compared with those of existing commercial software under the same conditions. The results demonstrated that considering the human characteristics of evacuees and their interaction with risk factors is important for simulating crowd evacuation more realistically. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Cryogenic gas accidents; Emergency evacuation; Evacuee–CFD data interaction; Floating LNG bunkering terminal,Accidents; Disasters; Gases; Liquefied natural gas; Simulation platform; Computational fluid; Cryogenic gas accident; Dynamic data; Emergency evacuation; Evacuation simulation; Evacuee–computational fluid dynamic data interaction; Floating liquefied natural gas bunkering terminal; Fluid-dynamics; Gas accidents; Simulation platform; Computational fluid dynamics,"Choi, B.C.; Division of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, South Korea; эл. почта: byungchul.choi@hotmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

The safety of LNG storage has gained the concerns from the public due to the potential severe consequences that may arise from LNG leakage. In this paper, a three-dimensional model with the combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is proposed to predict LNG vapor dispersion and estimate the strength of the LNG leakage source. The LNG vapor dispersion CFD model is validated by the experimental data with good feasibility, and is further demonstrated with the reasonable modeling of the characteristics of the LNG vapor dispersion in a typical receiving terminal. The effectiveness of the proposed CFD and EnKF coupling model is evaluated and validated by a twin experiment. The results of the twin experiment indicate that the proposed CFD and EnKF coupling model allows the integration of observation data into the CFD simulations to enhance the prediction accuracy of the LNG vapor spatial-temporal distribution and thereby realizing a reasonable estimation of the LNG leakage velocity under complex environments.

Methods On 1 February 2021, we downloaded data from the Global Burn Registry on demographic and clinical characteristics of patients younger than 19 years. We performed multivariate regressions to identify risk factors predictive of mortality and total body surface area affected by burns. Findings Of the 2957 paediatric patients with burn injuries, 974 involved cooking (32.9%). More burns occurred in boys (532 patients; 54.6%) than in girls, and in children 2 years and younger (489 patients; 50.2%). Accidental contact and liquefied petroleum caused most burn injuries (729 patients; 74.8% and 293 patients; 30.1%, respectively). Burn contact by explosions (odds ratio, OR: 2.8; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.4–5.7) or fires in the cooking area (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.3–6.8), as well as the cooking fuels wood (OR: 2.2; 95 CI%: 1.3–3.4), kerosene (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.0–3.6) or natural gas (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.0–2.2) were associated with larger body surface area affected. Mortality was associated with explosions (OR: 7.5; 95% CI: 2.2–25.9) and fires in the cooking area (OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 1.9–25.7), charcoal (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 2.0–10.5), kerosene (OR: 3.9; 95% CI: 1.4–10.8), natural gas (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.5–6.1) or wood (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.1–7.1). Conclusion Preventive interventions directed against explosions, fires in cooking areas and hazardous cooking fuels should be implemented to reduce morbidity and mortality from cooking-related burn injuries. © 2021, World Health Organization.

Natural crude oil seeps, in addition to leaking petroleum pipelines, have resulted in chronic contamination of the surrounding terrestrial environments since the time of petroleum discovery, production, and refinement in Trinidad. In this study, we isolated microbes from soils chronically contaminated with crude oil using a culture-dependent approach with enrichment. The sampling of eight such sites located in the southern peninsula of Trinidad revealed a diverse microbial composition and novel oil-degrading filamentous fungi and yeast as single-isolate degraders and naturally occurring consortia, with specific bacterial species not previously reported in the literature. Multiple sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses confirmed the identity of the top degraders. The filamentous fungal community based on culturable species was dominated by Ascomycota, and the recovered yeast isolates were affiliated with Basidiomycota (65.23%) and Ascomycota (34.78%) phyla. Enhanced biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons is maintained by biocatalysts such as lipases. Five out of seven species demonstrated extracellular lipase activity in vitro. Our findings could provide new insights into microbial resources from chronically contaminated terrestrial environments, and this information will be beneficial to the bioremediation of petroleum contamination and other industrial applications. © 2021 by the authors.

However, few studies have explored their intrinsic relationship until now. This study conducted morphologic observation, heavy metal monitoring and isotopes analysis in indoor and outdoor dust, as well as the atmospheric particulates in Hefei. Morphologic analysis demonstrated atmospheric particulates were affected by fly ash and construction, road dust mainly came from automobile exhaust and indoor dust particles were interfered by multiple sources, including the secondary reaction of fly ash. Chemical speciation analysis of heavy metals showed the exchange of heavy metals between atmospheric particulates and indoor dust was dominated by non-residual metals, while the exchange between road dust and indoor dust tended to rely on residual metals. The assessment results of heavy metals in particulates showed that indoor carcinogenic risks were greater than outdoor for children, however, for adults, outdoor carcinogenic risks were greater than indoor. Stable isotopes analysis indicated carbon in the dust outside buildings was derived from flying dust, and atmospheric particulates might derive from vehicle exhaust, or partly from natural gas. While sulfur in atmospheric particulates was derived mainly from coal combustion. The release from indoor activities, especially natural gas exhaust emitted from cooking had a certain impact on atmospheric particulates. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Heavy metals; Indoor; Morphologic analysis; Outdoor; Stable isotopes,"Atmospheric chemistry; Chemical speciation; Coal ash; Coal combustion; Fly ash; Heavy metals; Isotopes; Metal analysis; Natural gas; Natural gas vehicles; Particles (particulate matter); Risk assessment; Roads and streets; Atmospheric particulate; Automobile exhaust; Heavy metal monitoring; Heavy metals in particulates; Indoor activities; Morphologic analysis; Outdoor environment; Secondary reactions; Dust; carbon; carcinogen; heavy metal; isotope; natural gas; sulfur; coal; heavy metal; carcinogen; comparative study; dust; exhaust emission; fly ash; health risk; heavy metal; indoor air; observational method; particulate matter; pollutant source; risk assessment; speciation (chemistry); Article; combustion; cooking; dust; exhaust gas; fly ash; human; indoor environment; risk assessment; adult; air pollutant; child; city; dust; environmental monitoring; indoor air pollution; Anhui; China; Hefei; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Cities; Coal; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment","Liu, G.; CAS Key Laboratory of Crust-Mantle Materials and Environment, China; эл. почта: lgj@ustc.edu.cn",,Elsevier Ltd,00456535,,CMSHA,33601210.0,English,Chemosphere,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100754488

For weak cemented samples with very poor conductivity, the conventional ways such as decreasing accelerating voltage or current as well as coating a thin layer of carbon or gold fail to eliminate all the detrimental effect, leading to image distortion in the form of lateral shift and longitudinal stretching. A new nanoprobe-assisted method is explored in FIB-SEM tomography to address this problem and improve image quality. To be specific, a metallic nanoprobe is induced and attached on the sample surface to create an express path for the export of excess electrons near the region of interest, which effectively removes distortion and drift when imaging. Two adjacent areas were characterised and reconstructed into 3D digital models by FIB-SEM tomography with nanoprobe-assisted method applied to one region only. The lateral shift creates zigzag feature for distorted region and the longitudinal stretching of undistorted object can reach 14%. Average pore size of distorted region is larger than that of the undistorted region, however considering the longitudinal stretching, the average pore size of distorted region can be corrected to the same level as the undistorted region. The systematic error caused by distortion for poorly conductive porous rock is hazardous for digital rock physics analysis. Therefore, the nanoprobe-assisted FIB-SEM tomography should be regarded as a one of the optional and feasible procedures in case decreasing accelerating voltage or current as well as coating a thin layer of conductive material does not work. © 2021 Royal Microscopical Society",distortion; FIB-SEM; nanoprobe; tomography,,"Yang, J.; Key Laboratory of Shale Gas and Geoengineering, China; эл. почта: yang@mail.iggcas.ac.cn",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,00222720,,JMICA,33448359.0,English,J.

While the potential energy transition pathways in developed countries are clear, they have not been well explored for developing countries. Here, we study the average annual growth rate of energy consumption in 12 aggregated regions during 2001-2017 and the driving factors behind that growth. The countries with high energy consumption growth rates were concentrated in Asia and North Africa and four of the top five regions were in Asia, while the energy consumption in developed countries was stable or even declined in that period. Therefore, based on a comprehensive consideration of factors such as population and economic development, to quantify the role of renewable energy, we analyze the long time series of energy consumption for China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and Bangladesh since the 1970s. Despite economic development and population growth accelerating energy consumption substantially upward, energy intensity made energy consumption decrease. Coal and oil dominated the energy transition pathway in China and India, while biomass and natural gas dominated in Indonesia, Myanmar and Bangladesh. The amount of CO2 emissions in different countries was closely related to the amount and type of the energy they used. Our research results emphasize the importance of improving energy efficiency and adjusting energy structure to reduce energy consumption and achieve sustainable development. © 2021 The Author(s).

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States","In the last decade, the transition away from coal and to fossil gas and biomass in the U.S. has had a major influence on greenhouse gas emissions, especially from electricity generation. However, the effect of this transition on the public health burden of air pollution is not well understood. We use three reduced complexity models (RCMs) and emissions inventory data to reconstruct the changes in health impacts due to PM2.5 exposure from stationary fuel combustion sources in the U.S., from 2008 to 2017. In 2008, the health impacts of air pollution from stationary sources was largely driven by coal combustion. By 2017, the contribution of coal has dropped precipitously, and the health burden of stationary air pollution sources is shared among a mixture of source types and fuels - largely gas and biomass in buildings and industry, and the remaining coal-fired electricity generation. Nationwide, in 2017, health impacts of biomass and wood combustion are higher than combustion of coal and gas individually. Industrial boilers had the highest emissions and health impacts, followed by residential buildings, electricity, and then commercial buildings. All three RCMs indicate that biomass and wood are the leading sources of stationary source air pollution health impacts in 24 states, and that the total health impacts of gas surpass that of coal in 19 states and the District of Columbia. We develop a projection method using state-level energy consumption data for 2018 and show that these trends likely continued. The RCMs had high agreement for 2008 emissions, when sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants were the predominant air pollution source. However there was substantial disagreement between the three RCMs on the 2017 health burden, likely due to pollutants less well-characterized by the RCMs having a higher proportionate share of total impacts. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this study, sixteen cases of bench-scale tests, covering liquid nitrogen (LN2) with HEF, designed by orthogonal principle were conducted to investigate the effects of utilized HEF on the LNG liquid pool's evaporation rate. Liquid nitrogen was substituted for LNG due to the flammability of LNG. Minor discrepancy exists between thermal parameters of LN2 and LNG. Thus, the validity of the substitution can be guaranteed. Sequence of importance of each influence factor can be obtained by analyzing the evaporation rate as: foam solution mixing ratio of C &gt; foam thickness B &gt; supply pressure A &gt; foam addition method D. The optimal values of each factor are A1 = 0.5 MPa, B2 = 1.0 m, C2 = 6% and D1 = one-time addition respectively. It implies that the optimal solution should be A1B2C2D1. The conclusion on the effects of each factor on evaporation rate analyzed by variance analysis is similar to the results mentioned above. Through regression analysis, significant differences were in evaporation rate at different levels of water pressure as well as foam thickness, and distinct interaction was observed between supplying pressure and foam thickness. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Evaporation rate; Expansion foam; Low temperature liquid pool; Orthogonal experiment,Evaporation; Gas hazards; Liquid nitrogen; Natural gas transportation; Optimal systems; Temperature; Bench-scale test; Evaporation rate; High expansion foams; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Low temperatures; Optimal solutions; Thermal parameters; Variance analysis; Liquefied natural gas,"Pan, X.; College of Safety Science and Engineering, China; эл. почта: xuhaipan@njtech.edu.cn",,Elsevier B.V.,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

This scenario raises concerns for the safety of LNG bunkering and storage at ports, due to the potentially severe accidents that may arise from LNG leakage. In this paper, an integrated quantitative risk assessment model for LNG bunkering and storage at ports based on Bayesian-Catastrophe-EPE (Energy transfer theory, Preliminary hazard analysis and Evolution tree) method was proposed. The energy-based EPE model was used to derive Bayesian network (BN) causal structure, and the catastrophe theory was employed to deal with experts’ judgment to determine the conditional probability tables of BN. The proposed BN-based risk assessment model can provide a novel perspective to identify hazards and risks, and to assess the evolution process of LNG accidents from causes to consequences. The results of scenario analysis of typical LNG accidents demonstrate the soundness and applicability of the proposed model. Moreover, sensitivity analysis was implemented to identify critical hazards and quantify the correlations between each element considered in LNG accidents. The proposed risk assessment framework is of great significance to widen the technical tools available to support safety assessment and loss prevention of LNG bunkering and storage at ports. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Bayesian network; Catastrophe theory; Critical hazards; LNG; Risk assessment,Accidents; Bayesian networks; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Energy transfer; Hazards; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Catastrophe theory; Conditional probability tables; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Preliminary hazard analysis; Quantitative risk assessment; Risk assessment framework; Risk assessment models; Safety assessments; Liquefied natural gas; liquefied natural gas; accident prevention; Article; Bayesian Catastrophe Energy transfer theory Preliminary hazard analysis Evolution tree; Bayesian network; controlled study; disaster; energy transfer; hazard assessment; phylogenetic tree; probability; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; storage,"Wu, J.; School of Emergency Management and Safety Engineering, China; эл. почта: jiansongwu@hotmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

Compared to a recent study of California houses with code-compliant ventilation, apartments were smaller, had fewer occupants, higher densities, and higher mechanical ventilation rates. Mean PM2.5, formaldehyde, NO2, and CO2 were 7.7 µg/m3, 14.1, 18.8, and 741 ppm in apartments; these are 4% lower, 25% lower, 165% higher, and 18% higher compared to houses with similar cooking frequency. Four apartments had weekly PM2.5 above the California annual outdoor standard of 12 µg/m3 and also discrete days above the World Health Organization 24-hour guideline of 25 µg/m3. Two apartments had weekly NO2 above the California annual outdoor standard of 30 ppb. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

One of our two overarching alternative energy goals was to estimate the health benefits of complete elimination of coal energy, supplemented by natural gas and renewables. The second was a policy scenario similar to the U.S. 2013 Climate Action Plan (CAP), which played a pivotal role leading up to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. We used the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model created by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis for our model simulations. We found that 17,137–24,220 premature deaths can be avoided if coal energy is completely replaced by alternative energy, and 8,693–9,281 premature deaths can be avoided if coal energy is replaced by alternatives in a CAP-like scenario. A CAP-like scenario using emission-controls in coal plants costs $11–18 per person. Reducing coal energy in China under a CAP-like scenario would free up $9.4 billion in the annual energy budget to spend on alternatives, whereas eliminating the cost of coal energy frees up $32 billion. This study's estimates show that more stringent alternative energy targets in China are worth the investment in terms of health. © Copyright © 2021 Scott, Sander, Nemet and Patz.",air pollution; China; coal-fired power plants; human health; renewable energy,coal; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; China; electric power plant; epidemiology; human; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Coal; Humans; Power Plants,"Scott, M.; Duke Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity, United States; эл. почта: melissa.j.scott@duke.edu",,Frontiers Media S.A.,22962565,,,33968876.0,English,Front.

Its aim is to discuss the appropriateness of the studied method, to analyze its weak sides and to propose its robustness improvement. Thus, data presented in the above study were examined and recalculated, yielding, among others, indicators of annual energy savings (in kWh per m2 of total heated area) and specific proposals investment costs (in € per m2 of total heated area). By analyzing the obtained data for all public buildings, a significantly simplified approach to this problematic has been suggested while several other features of the research method and some presented results lack proper reasoning and discussion. Individual approach to each public building has been proposed and discussed point-by-point to enhance the method’s applicability. As a result, more realistic outcomes are obtained, and suitable investment actions can be proposed. © 2021 by the author.

Produced wastewater liberates formation-derived radionuclides and contains previously uncharacterized organohalides thought to be generated within the shale well, both posing unknown toxicity to human and ecological health. Here, we assess the toxicity of 42 input media and produced fluid samples collected from four wells in the Utica formation and Marcellus Shale using two distinct endpoint screening assays. Broad spectrum acute toxicity was assessed using a bioluminescence inhibition assay employing the halotolerant bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri, while predictive mammalian cytotoxicity was evaluated using a N-acetylcysteine (NAC) thiol reactivity assay. The acute toxicity and thiol reactivity of early-stage flowback was higher than later produced fluids, with levels diminishing through time as the natural gas wells matured. Acute toxicity of early stage flowback and drilling muds were on par with the positive control, 3,5-dichlorophenol (6.8 mg L-1). Differences in both acute toxicity and thiol reactivity between paired natural gas well samples were associated with specific chemical additives. Samples from wells containing a larger diversity and concentration of organic additives resulted in higher acute toxicity, while samples from a well applying a higher composition of ammonium persulfate, a strong oxidizer, showed greater thiol reactivity, predictive of higher mammalian toxicity. Both acute toxicity and thiol reactivity are consistently detected in produced waters, in some cases present up to nine months after hydraulic fracturing. These results support that specific chemical additives, the reactions generated by the additives, or the constituents liberated from the formation by the additives contribute to the toxicity of hydraulic fracturing produced waters and reinforces the need for careful consideration of early produced fluid management. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Additives; Ammonium persulfate; Cytotoxicity; Fracture; Hydraulic fracturing; Mammals; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Produced Water; Screening; Shale gas; Toxicity; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; 3 ,5-dichlorophenol; Bioluminescence inhibitions; Chemical additive; Ecological health; Halotolerant bacteria; Mammalian toxicity; N-acetylcysteine; Organic additives; Natural gas wells; 3,5 dichlorophenol; acetylcysteine; natural gas; thiol; natural gas; Aliivibrio fischeri; animal cell; Article; bioluminescence; chemical composition; cytotoxicity; fracking; geochemistry; mammal cell; nonhuman; oil shale; priority journal; processing; sample; sampling; sediment; toxicity; wastewater; African American; analysis; human; oil and gas field; toxicity; waste water; water pollutant; African Americans; Humans; Hydraulic Fracking; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Mouser, P.J.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, United States; эл. почта: paula.mouser@unh.edu",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,33908986.0,English,Environ.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity is one of the most policy-relevant environmental characteristics of natural gas, particularly as decarbonization efforts proceed. Given that natural gas is mostly methane, a powerful GHG, methane emissions from the natural gas system contribute substantially to the GHG intensity of natural gas. Research has established that methane emissions from natural gas systems are climatically relevant and higher than long understood, in part due to variation in production-stage emissions by basin. This work combines recent estimates of basin-level US production-stage methane emissions, data on US natural gas production, consumption, and trade, and a spatial evaluation of pipeline connections between production basins and consumer states to generate first-order estimates of the production-stage methane emissions intensity of natural gas consumed in the United States. Although natural gas is a commodity product, the environmental footprint of a given unit of natural gas varies based on its origin and infrastructural needs. We find that production-stage methane emissions intensity of delivered natural gas by state varies from 0.9% to 3.6% (mass methane emitted from natural gas production sites per mass methane withdrawn). These production-stage emissions add 16%-65% (global warming potential (GWP)-100; 38%-157%, GWP-20) to combustion carbon dioxide emissions. Other sources of life cycle methane emissions downstream of production can be similar in magnitude. Natural gas consumed in Arizona, Kansas, and New Mexico has the highest estimated production-stage methane emissions intensity, largely due to reliance on high-emission basins. Limitations include emissions-related data gaps and sensitivity to allocation approaches, but results demonstrate decision-relevant variability in the GHG impact of natural gas. © 2021 The Author(s).

Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, Boston, MA  02115, United States","The carbon intensity (CI) of corn ethanol, the primary renewable fuel used in transportation, has been actively researched and quantified over the last three decades. Reliable estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for corn ethanol are important since these values help determine significant policy and market decisions on state, national, and international levels. We reviewed well-to-wheel GHG life cycle analyses (LCAs) for corn ethanol and evaluated models, input data, and results for farming, fuel production, co-product credit, land use change (LUC), transport of feedstock and fuel, tailpipe, and denaturant. Compared to earlier analyses, recent LCAs for corn ethanol contain updates to modeling systems and data that reflect: (a) market-driven changes in corn production that lowered the intensity of fertilizer and fossil fuel use on farms; (b) more efficient use of natural gas and recent electric generation mix data for energy consumed at ethanol refineries, and (c) LUC analyses based on hybrid economic-biophysical models that account for land conversion, land productivity, and land intensification. LCAs that include these latest developments yield a central best estimate of CI for corn ethanol of 51.4 gCO2e MJ−1 (range of 37.6-65.1 gCO2e MJ−1) which is 46% lower than the average CI for neat gasoline. The largest components of total CI are ethanol production (29.6 gCO2e MJ−1, 58% of total) and farming practices net of co-product credit (13.2 gCO2e MJ−1, 26%), while LUC is a minor contributor (3.9 gCO2e MJ−1, 7%). Market conditions that favor greater adoption of precision agriculture systems, retention of soil organic carbon, and demand for co-products from ethanol production may lower the CI of corn ethanol further. Continued refinement of models to account for co-products, conservation of soil carbon, and direct and indirect LUC is expected to produce ever more accurate estimates in the future. © 2021 The Author(s).

LNG bunkering availability is fundamental to the adoption of LNG as a fuel. The proliferation of LNG bunkering technology is dependent on safe and efficient operations. In order to maintain tight sailing schedules and optimise cost, it is suggested that LNG bunkering and the associated operations (such as people movements, cargo loading/unloading, crew transfer, crane operations, port activities, and oil bunkering) be conducted simultaneously, which is referred to as simultaneous operations (SIMOPs). Towards understanding the safety of LNG bunkering SIMOPs, this paper presents a systematic review and synthesis of the literature related to LNG bunkering and SIMOPs. Moreover, the paper sheds light on the safety philosophy and risk analysis methods emerging within the literature in these areas. The study identifies a series of research gaps that highlight the most fruitful areas for future investigations in this area, thereby helping to lay the groundwork for research that would potentially accelerate the development of safe and efficient LNG bunkering SIMOPs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Bunkering; Literature review; LNG; Risk analysis; Safety; Simultaneous operations,Green manufacturing; Marine industry; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Crane operations; Liquified natural gas; Literature reviews; Maritime industry; Research gaps; Risk analysis methods; Simultaneous operation; Systematic Review; Liquefied natural gas,"Enshaei, H.Swanson Building, F40, University of Tasmania, Australia; эл. почта: hossein.enshaei@utas.edu.au",,Elsevier B.V.,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

Drilling fluid is a water–clay chemical mix-ture. Produced water is a water–sand chemical mixture. Land farming is a common disposal tech-nique of drilling fluid and produced water. In the land farming process, amendments of fluid are repeatedly applied to the soil surface. Plant growth and soil chemical properties may be altered by additions of drilling fluid, because of alkalinity, salinity, trace elements, and petroleum residue con-tained in waste. The objective of this study was to determine the change in soil pH, electrical con-ductivity (EC), total nitrogen and carbon, and extractable nutrient levels following the land application of drilling fluid and produced water. The study was a comparison of three plots with similar soil properties and conditions. The three study plots had various levels of drilling fluid and produced water applications. The data show a major difference from field-to-field for EC, Na, and Cl levels. The EC and salt levels increased with additional applications of drilling fluid and produced water. The percent total nitrogen values and plant available P levels were very low in all fields. High EC and salt values, coupled with low N and P levels, would be detrimental to plant growth and development. To successfully vegetate this land-farm site, application of N and P fertilizer would be required. This study help to give a better understanding of practical ways to land-farm drilling fluid and produced water in a fashion that both minimizes environmental issues and is economically feasible in Arkansas. Thus, this research will provide important information for soil contamination management and contributes on understanding of the responses of soil properties to drilling fluid and produced water in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

In many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), valid and representative estimates of people exposed to household air pollution (HAP) are scarce. The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) is an important and consistent source of data on household fuel use for cooking and has facilitated studies of health effects. However, the body of research based on DHS data has not been systematically identified, nor its strengths and limitations critically assessed as a whole. We aimed to systematically review epidemiological studies using DHS data that considered cooking fuel type as the main exposure, including the assessment of the extent and key drivers of bias. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and the DHS publication portal. We assessed the quality and risk of bias (RoB) of studies using a novel tool. Of 2748 records remaining after removing duplicates, 63 were read in full. A total of 45 out of 63 studies were included in our review, spanning 11 different health outcomes and representing 50 unique analyses. In total, 41 of 45 (91%) studies analysed health outcomes in children <5 years of age, including respiratory infections (n = 17), death (all-cause) (n = 14), low birthweight (n = 5), stunting and anaemia (n = 5). Inconsistencies were observed between studies in how cooking fuels were classified into relatively high-and low-polluting. Overall, 36/50 (80%) studies reported statistically significant adverse associations between polluting fuels and health outcomes. In total, 18/50 (36%) of the analyses were scored as having moderate RoB, while 16/50 (32%) analyses were scored as having serious or critical RoB. Although HAP exposure assessment is not the main focus of the DHS, it is the main, often only, source of information in many LMICs. An appreciable proportion of studies using it to analyse the association between cooking fuel use and health have potential for high RoB, mostly related to confounder control, exposure assessment and misclassification, and outcome ascertainment. Based on our findings, we provide some sugges-tions for ways in which revising the information collected by the DHS could make it even more amenable to studies of household fuel use and health, and reduce the RoB, without being onerous to collect and analyse. © 2021 by the authors.

This critical service remains unrealised in many African countries. Women's empowerment is known to promote healthcare service use, child nutrition and agricultural productivity. In Africa, however, little is known about the relationship between women's empowerment and household fuel use, and if it varies between countries. Therefore, we assessed the cross-sectional associations between women's empowerment and cooking fuel use in 31 African countries. We analysed individual-level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, conducted between 2003 and 2018 (n = 264 269 [women-household pairs]). We used a novel, Africa-specific index (survey-based women's empowerment index), including three domains of empowerment: decision-making, attitude to violence, and social independence. Hierarchical logistic regression models assessed the associations between women's empowerment domains and the type of fuel used in the household ('clean': electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biogas or natural gas; 'polluting': solid fuels or kerosene). Results were adjusted for household- and area-level covariates, and expressed as odds ratios (OR). The 31 country-specific estimates were combined using meta-analysis. Approximately 43 778 (14.5%) of households used clean fuels. Overall, between 12/31 and 22/31 country-level estimates showed a significant association between a one standard deviation increase in empowerment domains (higher scores indicate greater empowerment), and higher odds of using clean fuel as primary energy source for cooking. The random-effect meta-analytic estimates showed that increased empowerment was associated with higher odds of using clean fuel for attitude to violence (OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.12-1.33), social independence (OR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.28-1.42), and decision-making (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05-1.15). These findings suggest that empowering women, in addition to being crucial in its own right, has potential to accelerate transitions to clean fuel in Africa, although these associations vary between countries. © 2021 The Author(s).",Africa; Cooking fuel; Demographic and health survey; Energy transition; Household air pollution; Women's empowerment,Agricultural robots; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Economics; Health; Liquefied natural gas; Logistic regression; Population statistics; Productivity; Random processes; Surveys; Agricultural productivity; Cross sectional analysis; Healthcare services; Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Logistic regression models; Primary energy source; Socio-economic development; Standard deviation; Liquefied petroleum gas; biomass burning; demographic survey; empowerment; fuel consumption; health status; household survey; pollution exposure; residential energy; sustainable development; womens status,"Odo, D.B.; College of Health Sciences, Ethiopia; эл. почта: d.bogale@uq.edu.au",,IOP Publishing Ltd,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100774380

On hot days, when electricity demand peaks, the ambient air and water used to cool these plants can become too warm, forcing operators to curtail electricity output. Using all available observed daily-scale plant outage data, we estimate the observed dependence of thermal plant curtailment on temperature and runoff and use this relationship to quantify curtailments due to global warming. Climate change to date has increased average thermal power plant curtailment in nuclear, coal, oil, and natural gas fired plants by 0.75-1 percentage points; with each degree Celsius of additional warming, we project curtailment to increase by 0.8-1.2 percentage points during peak demand, requiring an additional 18-27 GW of capacity, or 40-60 additional average-sized power plants, to offset this global power loss. Relative to policy scenarios with global transitions to renewable portfolios or that allow aging plants to retire, thermal power generation is a systemically disadvantaged means of electricity production in a warming world. Our results point to the crucial need for additional operational data across a diversity of thermal power plants to better constrain the risks warming poses to our electricity supply. © 2021 The Author(s).",Climate change; Climate impacts; Electricity generation curtailment; Energy sector; Thermoelectric power plants,Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Natural gasoline plants; Radioactive materials; Thermoelectric power plants; Electricity demands; Electricity output; Electricity production; Electricity supply; Global transitions; Percentage points; Thermal power generation; Thermal power plants; Nuclear power plants; ambient air; electricity generation; fossil fuel; global warming; policy making; power generation; thermal power; water use,"Coffel, E.D.; Department of Geography and the Environment, United States; эл. почта: edcoffel@maxwell.syr.edu",,IOP Publishing Ltd,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100774000

To date, the association between hydraulic fracturing activity and birth outcomes has not been evaluated in this region. Objective: To evaluate the association between the hydraulic fracturing well density/proximity and birth outcomes (birthweight, head circumference, preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA)). Methods: We used birth records from the Fort St John hospital between December 30, 2006 and December 29, 2016 (n = 6333 births). To estimate gestational exposure, we used inverse distance weighting (IDW) to calculate the density/proximity of hydraulic fracturing wells to pregnant women’s postal code centroid. For each birth, we calculated three IDWs using 2.5, 5, and 10 km buffer zones around women’s postal code centroid. We used linear and logistic regressions to evaluate associations between quartiles of postal code well density/proximity and birth outcomes, controlling for relevant covariates. Results: No associations were found between postal code well density/proximity and head circumference or SGA. A negative association was found between postal code well density/proximity and birthweight for infants born to women in the 2nd quartile of the 10 km buffer (β [95% confidence interval (CI)]: −47.28 g [−84.30; −10.25]), and in the 2nd (β [95% CI]: −40.87 g [−78.01; −3.73]) and 3rd (β [95% CI]: −42.01 g [−79.15; −4.87]) quartiles of the 5 km buffer. Increased odds of preterm birth were observed among women in the 2nd quartile of the 2.5 km buffer (odds ratio (OR) [95% CI]: 1.60 [1.30; 2.43]). Conclusions: This is the first epidemiological study in Northeastern British Columbia evaluating associations between hydraulic fracturing and health outcomes. Our results show inconsistent patterns of association between hydraulic fracturing, preterm birth and reduced birthweight, and effect estimates did not match expected dose-response relationships. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",Birth outcomes; Hydraulic fracturing; Inverse distance weighting; Northeastern British Columbia,"natural gas; birth weight; British Columbia; female; fracking; human; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; Birth Weight; British Columbia; Female; Humans; Hydraulic Fracking; Infant, Newborn; Natural Gas; Pregnancy; Premature Birth","Caron-Beaudoin, É.; Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, 2375 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, Canada; эл. почта: elyse.caronbeaudoin@utoronto.ca",,Springer Nature,15590631,,,32651474.0,English,J.

Therefore, aim of this study is to make an emission model for SO2 and NO2 pollutants released from the rolling industry of Sepid-Farab Kavir Steel (SKS) complex using the AERMOD model and health risk assessment. Sampling pollutants released from SKS complex was performed in January 2017 at 10 different sites. Distribution of these pollutants was investigated by AERMOD model, domain site of AERMOD was designed for area around the factory with a radius of 30 km, and also SO2 and NO2 modeling was performed for both natural gas and liquid fuel. Human health risk assessment was also studied. The results of this study demonstrated the emission of SO2 and NO2 from this complex is less than the maximum allowable, when used natural gas as the main fuel. The hourly concentration of SO2 reached about 324 μg/m3, which in higher than the standard value for 1 h. Considering the findings, the urban gas is considered as a clean source in terms of furnace air output and the concentration of emitted pollutants. Also, it has no side effects on workers’ health. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",AERMOD; Air pollution modeling; Risk assessment; Steel complex,,"Mohammadzadeh, M.; Social Determinants of Health (SDH) Research Center, Iran; эл. почта: m.mohammadzadeh997@gmail.com",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,2052336X,,,,English,J.

Currently, most of studies for HTGR-hydrogen plant are focused only on the impact of hydrogen presence to the HTGR plant safety. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the presence of natural gas and synthetic gas from Steam Methane Reforming hydrogen plant on the combine HTGR-Hydrogen production system using ALOHA software. Three selected hazardous materials: CH4, CO and H2were analyzed. The selected potential hazards of the hazardous materials after leaking from the pipe were downwind suffocation/toxication, flammable area and blast area from vapor cloud explosion. Two types of parameter, i.e., meteorological dispersion (including wind speed, temperature, humidity, nuclear building air changes for day and night) and source release parameters (including pipeline length, and distance from the reactor building to the hydrogen plant), were selected for this study. The effects of the parameters on the hazard distance were then analyzed. The study shows that hydrogen detector needs to be installed at the plant to ensure safety of field operator. Furthermore, CO adsorber and H2recombiner should be installed at the Reactor HVAC system for CO poisoning and H2fire protection. Provision of a separation distance of more than 250 meters or construction of a blast barrier between the reactor building and the hydrogen plant is also recommended to protect the reactor from H2explosion hazard. © 2021 Atom Indonesia.

To be specific, age-related chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, diabetes, and kidney disease contribute greatly to the advancement and rapid progression of dementia. Furthermore, unmodifiable risk factors such as advancing age and genetics as well as modifiable risk factors such as socioeconomic status, educational attainment, exercise, and diet further contribute to the development of dementia. Current statistics and research show that minority populations such as Hispanic Americans in the United States face the greatest burden of dementia due to the increase in the prevalence of overall population age, predisposing genetics, age-related chronic diseases, low socioeconomic status, as well as poor lifestyle choices and habits. Additionally, Hispanic Americans living within Texas and the rural areas of West Texas face the added challenge of finding appropriate healthcare services. This article will focus upon the research associated with AD as well as the prevalence of AD within the Hispanic American population of Texas and rural West Texas. Furthermore, this article will also discuss the prevalence of age-related chronic diseases, unmodifiable risk factors, and modifiable risk factors which lead to the progression and development of AD within the Hispanic American population of the United States, Texas, and rural West Texas. © 2021 - The authors.

Airborne microbiological composition and abundance was examined inside five different fuel type buses (diesel (EURO IV and EURO V), hybrid diesel (HD), compressed natural gas (CNG), hybrid natural gas (HCNG) and electric vehicle (EV)) from Barcelona bus system, inside and outside the tourist bus and different periods of campaigns (summer: May–September and winter: November–March). Quantitative PCR was used to quantify total bacteria, Penicillium/Aspergillus and Cladosporium sp. and Kinetic Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Assay for endotoxins. The targeted 16S rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced to asses bacterial community composition and biodiversity. Regarding the targeted microorganisms, the results showed low bioaerosol concentrations, being fungi and endotoxins below the detection limit, although bacterial airborne has a geometric average of 103 equivalent E. Coli genomes/m3. Airborne bacterial community biodiversity showed that Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most abundant Phylum in the different sampled buses and in the two seasons (summer: May–September and winter: November–March). While regarding to genera taxonomic category, the different fuel type buses presented a high overlap degree, being Cutibacterium the most abundant and Paracoccus the one only detected inside. The different seasons showed that the different taxonomic genera decrease from summer: May–September to winter: November–March and in this case Paracoccus was the most abundant. Overall, biodiversity inside buses is greatly affected by the presence of humans inside, but also by the outdoor sources at the moment of the sampling, and the seasonal period, more than the type of bus. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Bioaerosols; Indoor air quality; Public buses; Tourist bus,,"Duchaine, C.; Centre de Recherche de L’Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie Et de Pneumologie de Québec (IUCPQ), Canada; эл. почта: Caroline.Duchaine@bcm.ulaval.ca",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,03935965,,AROBF,,English,Aerobiologia,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104116990

In view of this concern, this study examined the role of coal and oil energy utilization in environmental sustainability drive of Turkey from the framework of sustainable development vis-à-vis income expansion over an extended period of 1965–2017. Design/methodology/approach: In this regard, the authors employ carbon emission as an environmental and dependent variable while the Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPC), coal and oil energy consumption are the explanatory variables employed in the study. Findings: The study found that both energy mixes (coal and oil) have a detrimental impact on the environment in both the short and long run, but oil consumption exerts a less severe impact as compared to coal energy. In addition, sustainable development via income growth is not feasible because the income–environmental degradation relationship follows a U-shaped pattern (invalidating the Environmental Kuznets curve, EKC hypothesis) especially when coal and oil remained the major source of lubrication to the economy. At least the EKC hypothesis is unattainable in Turkey as long as the country's major energy mix or primary energy (coal and oil) is in use, thus the application of other socioeconomic, macroeconomic policies might be essential. Research limitations/implications: Considering the lingering energy challenge associated with Turkey, this novel insight further presented useful policy perspectives to the government and stakeholders in the country's energy sector. Originality/value: This evidence (the U-shaped relationship) is further ascertained when the aggregate primary energy is employed. Thus, this study provides a novel insight that attaining a sustainable economic growth in Turkey remained a herculean task as long as a more aggressive energy transition approach is not encouraged. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Carbon emissions; Coal and oil utilization; EKC; Environmental quality; Turkey,carbon emission; economic growth; emissions trading; energy use; environmental economics; environmental management; environmental quality; Sustainable Development Goal; Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo,"Alola, A.A.; Economics and Finance, Turkey; эл. почта: aadewale@gelisim.edu.tr",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,14777835,,,,English,Manage.

Among these, the most significant is the ability to model systems, causal factors, and their dependencies in a probabilistic manner. This capability has enabled the community to do causal reasoning through associations, which answers questions such as: “How does new evidence (Formula presented.) about the occurrence of event (Formula presented.) change my belief about the occurrence of event (Formula presented.) ?” Associative reasoning has helped risk analysts to identify relevant risk-contributing factors and perform scenario analysis by evidence propagation. However, engineering risk assessment has yet to explore other features of BNs, such as the ability to reason through interventions, which enables the BN model to support answering questions of the form “How does doing (Formula presented.) change my belief about the occurrence of event (Formula presented.) ?” In this article, we propose to expand the scope of use of BN models in engineering risk assessment to support intervention reasoning. This will provide more robust risk-informed decision support by enabling the modeling of policies and actions before being implemented. To do this, we provide the formal mathematical background and tools to model interventions in BNs and propose a framework that enables its use in engineering risk assessment. This is demonstrated in an illustrative case study on third-party damage of natural gas pipelines, showing how BNs can be used to inform decision-makers about the effect that new actions/policies can have on a system. © 2021 Society for Risk Analysis",Bayesian Network; Causality; Decision Support; Engineering Risk Assessment; Intervention Reasoning,,"Ruiz-Tagle, A.; Systems Risk and Reliability Analysis Lab (SyRRA), United States; эл. почта: aruiztag@umd.edu",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,02724332,,RIAND,,English,Risk Anal.,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102183518

Aims: In this synthesis I examine humans’ dependence on external (non-metabolic) energy expenditure (e.g., fire, fossil fuels) as a common, root cause in these modern crises. Materials and Methods: Using fossil, archeological, and historical evidence I show that the human lineage has been dependent on external energy sources since the control of fire in the Paleolithic. This reliance has grown with the development of agriculture, the use of wind- and water-power, and the most recently with industrialization and the transition to fossil fuels. To place industrialization in context I develop a Rule of 50, whereby individuals in industrialized economies consume roughly 50-times more external energy and manufacture roughly 50-times more material than do hunter-gatherers. Results: Industrialization and mechanization, powered by fossil fuels, have promoted centralization and processing in food production, reduced physical activity, and increased air pollution (including greenhouse gas emissions). These developments have led in turn to NCD and climate change. Discussion and Conclusion: Climate change and NCD are connected both to one another and to our species’ deep evolutionary dependence on external energy. Transitioning to carbon-free energy is essential to reduce the existential risks of climate change, but will likely have only modest effects on NCD. With the impending exhaustion of oil, coal, and natural gas reserves, developing replacements for fossil fuels is also critical to maintaining our species’ external energy portfolio. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",,,"Pontzer, H.; Department of Evolutionary Anthropology, United States; эл. почта: herman.pontzer@duke.edu",,Wiley-Liss Inc.,10420533,,AJHUE,,English,Am.

Objective: Conducted in an area of Washington County, Pennsylvania, with extensive Marcellus Shale development, this study investigated whether operations at an unconventional natural gas well pad may contribute to ambient air concentrations of potential health concern at a nearby school campus. Methods: Almost 2 years of air monitoring for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was performed at three locations between 1000 and 2800 feet from the study well pad from December 2016 to October 2018. PM2.5 was measured continuously at one of the three sites using a beta attenuation monitor, while 24-h stainless steel canister samples were collected every 6 days at all sites for analysis of 58 VOCs. Results: Mean PM2.5 concentrations measured during the different well activity periods ranged from 5.4 to 9.5 μg/m3, with similar levels and temporal changes as PM2.5 concentrations measured at a regional background location. The majority of VOCs were either detected infrequently or not at all, with measurements for a limited number of VOCs indicating the well pad to be a source of small and transient contributions. Significance: All measurement data of PM2.5 and 58 VOCs, which reflect the cumulative contributions of emissions from the study well pad and other local/regional air pollutant sources (e.g., other well pads), were below health-based air comparison values, and thus do not provide evidence of either 24-hour or long-term air quality impacts of potential health concern at the school. © 2021, The Author(s).",Air monitoring; Marcellus Shale; Natural gas; PM2.5; Public health; VOCs,,"Long, C.M.; GradientUnited States; эл. почта: clong@gradientcorp.com",,Springer Nature,15590631,,,,English,J.

This chemical health risk assessment will assess how often the chemical is exposed to workers, how much exposure it is so that the level of risk can be understood. The purpose of enabling decisions to be made on appropriate control measure, training of employees, monitoring and surveillance activities as may be required to protect the health of employees who may exposed by hazardous chemicals to health at work. Methods: This research is research with a qualitative approach. Based on the data collected, this study is observational. This study uses the Chemical Health Risk Assessment (CHRA) method. This method is carried out by identifying chemicals, determining Hazard Rating, evaluating exposure, assessing the adequacy of the control measures that have been carried out, concluding the CHRA results, and identifying the efforts that need to be made. Result: In this study, there are three work units, namely a wet laboratory, oil laboratory, and gas laboratory. The chemicals analyzed are benzene, toluene, and xylene in the condensate. The hazardous chemical have significant risk now and already adequately controlled could increase in future (C2) which mean that the employees are at risk due to hazardous chemicals and it adequately controlled but the risk can increase in the future. Conclusion: Therefore, several steps can be taken to control the risk of health hazards from benzene, toluene, and xylene in the condensate, for example: determine precaution to maintain controls and minimize chances of higher exposure occurring; determine additional measures for regaining control if a high-risk event occurs despite precaution; identify measures, procedures, and equipment to prevent or control any accidental emission of chemical hazardous to health, determine if monitoring or health surveillance is required to check on the effectiveness of controls; and review assessment every five years or when is a change in circumstances. © 2021, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications.

Methods: The present cross-sectional study is based on data collected between April 2018 and March 2019 from public transport drivers in Delhi. All drivers coming for gas filling to 43 compressed natural gas (CNG) stations in Delhi were included in the study. The evaluation of sleep apnoea–related risk factors for motor vehicle accident was done using ESS and STOP-BANG Score. Results: A total of 4094 drivers participated in this study, and 299 drivers (7%) gave a history of motor vehicle accidents during the preceding 3 years. Drivers with STOP-BANG score ≥ 3 had a higher risk for MVA (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.26–2.02; p value < 0.0001). Score of ESS ≥ 10 carried a very high risk for MVA (OR 26.95; 95% CI 16.18–44.87; p value < 0.0001). The other risk factor of significance was alcoholism (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.04–1.80; p value < 0.0248). Conclusion: Among public transport drivers in Delhi, daytime sleepiness is the major contributing factor to motor vehicle accidents. ESS and STOP-BANG questionnaires may be good screening tools for the clinical evaluation of OSA.

Data are emerging that smell impairment is a prominent symptom in COVID-19 and that this coronavirus behaves differently in causing olfactory dysfunction compared with other respiratory viruses. Anosmia and hyposmia, the complete and partial loss of smell, respectively, can result from many causes, most commonly from viral infections, sinonasal disease, and head trauma. Olfactory dysfunction negatively impacts quality of life, because sense of smell is important for flavor perception and the enjoyment of food. Olfaction is also important for the detection of warning smells, such as smoke, natural gas leaks, and spoiled food. Allergists and immunologists frequently encounter anosmia and hyposmia in patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and will likely see more infection-induced olfactory dysfunction in the era of COVID-19. Therefore, now more than ever, it is crucial that we understand this impairment, how to evaluate and how to measure it. In this review, we offer a clinically relevant primer for the allergist and immunologist on olfactory dysfunction subtypes, exploring the pathophysiology, appropriate clinical assessment, objective smell testing, and management of this condition.

Natural gas in the form of a liquid (LNG) is considered a promising and highly attractive alternative due to the high density and relatively low cost of transportation. In the case of accidental release on water, elevated heat transfer causes rapid evaporation that has the potential to lead to a rapid phase transition (RPT), thus producing significant overpressures. In this work, the effects of composition, release rate, and the fluid dynamic regime of water on the RPT of LNG are analyzed by means of detailed analysis based on computational fluid dynamics and large eddy simulation for the turbulence model. The thermodynamic properties at ultra-low temperature related to the species considered in the mixtures are estimated by using an approach based on quantum mechanics. Results are compared with experimental analysis, quite satisfactorily. A preliminary conclusion shows that calm water, as within port facilities, decreases the likelihood of the RPT or its magnitude to a negligible intensity. On the contrary, the addition of ethane or propane may dramatically affect the explosive phenomenon. © 2020",Cryogenic dispersion; Evaporation rate; Liquefied natural gas; Rapid phase transition,Computational fluid dynamics; Fossil fuels; Heat transfer; Large eddy simulation; Liquefied natural gas; Phase transitions; Quantum theory; Temperature; Turbulence models; Accidental release; Dynamic regimes; Energy supplies; Environmental concerns; Experimental analysis; Port facilities; Rapid phase transitions; Ultra low temperatures; Natural gas transportation; ethane; liquefied natural gas; propane; water; Article; chemical composition; computational fluid dynamics; controlled study; cryogenic dispersion; evaporation; experimental study; explosion; hyperbarism; large eddy simulation; liquid; low temperature; mathematical model; phase transition; priority journal; quantum mechanics; rapid phase transition; simulation; thermodynamics; turbulence model,"Salzano, E.; Dipartimento di Ingegneria Civile, Via Terracini 28, Italy; эл. почта: ernesto.salzano@unibo.it",,Elsevier B.V.,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

It is very important to comprehend what kind of attributes play a role in adequate safety information flow in a communication network. For these reasons, the current study aimed to explore the effectiveness of safety communication on safety awareness and behavior. The data were collected by performing interviews with employees of teams at a liquefied natural gas terminal located in Pyeongtaek, South Korea. A social network analysis (SNA) was applied to visualize the pattern of the safety communication network and calculate the typical SNA metrics such as density, tie strength, betweenness and degree centrality. In addition, the number of communication channels was also considered as a crucial differentiator between teams. Then, a correlation analysis was applied to investigate the impact of calculated SNA metrics on safety awareness and behavior. As a result, density, tie strength, degree centrality and the channel variety showed a direct influence on safety awareness and behavior. Conversely, betweenness centrality was not an active metric. This study demonstrated that raising the level of SNA metrics such as density, tie strength and degree centrality, and using various channels to communicate safety information within teams, could support better safety awareness and behavior. © 2019 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).",liquefied natural gas terminal; petrochemical; safety awareness; safety behavior; safety communication; social network analysis,,"Park, D.J.; Department of Safety Engineering, South Korea; эл. почта: pdj70@seoultech.ac.kr",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,10803548,,IJOEF,30657015.0,English,Int.

By recirculating a water sample for approximately 10 mins, equilibrium was established between dissolved methane in the sample and methane in the measured gas phase according to Henry’s Law. The performance of the system was investigated by replicate analyses of several different water samples, spike recovery tests, comparison to analysis by head-space gas chromatography, and consideration of memory effects. The technique provided an adequate detection limit for the determination of natural background concentrations of methane in environmental waters and was approximately 28 times more sensitive than analysis by gas chromatography.

Fossil fuels such as gas energy play a major role in the energy demand of world. Natural gas (NG) containing of methane as a primary fuel is used in urban and building application. Moreover, development of technological methods for gas extraction increased the use of this resource. It is also a source of raw material for petrochemical industry. Although methane is often regarded as a non-toxic chemical but high concentration can reduce the percentage of oxygen in the air. Natural gas distribution, lower extraction cost and less environmental contamination are the advantages of natural gas consumption. In these years, natural gas as a source of energy basket was used due to environmental issues and decreasing of oil reserve in world. However, natural gas is the most important alternative instead of fuel. After extraction of natural gas, it sent to refiner. By finishing the refining and processing procedure, natural gas is chemically ready to use but it is colorless and odorless gas as physically. From a safety point of view, a change must be made in natural gas to be quickly and easily identifiable. In the gas distribution process for industrial and public use, insurance of the user safety is important. Many accidents are reported where gas leak cause these difficulties. Therefore, in this industry, sulfur containing compounds as a leak warning was added to transmission system in order to recognize gas egression. In the city station; natural gas with the maximum pressure of 700-1000 PSIG and a minimum pressure of 300-350 PSIG was transited and then pressure was reduced in the level of 250 PSIG. The compounds are used to prevent the potential risks of leaks and explosion. Sulfur containing compounds have a very prominent odor; so that is detectable by the sense of smell at the lowest level of release. These compounds could cause eye and throat irritation and bronchitis. Inhalation exposure of hydrocarbons increased the risk of headaches, eye irritation and asthma. However, occupational exposure to natural gas in this industry is considerable and the natural gas toxicity in workers is a health risk for gas staff industry. Although exposure to natural gas in homes is very low, exposure to natural gas for technical personnel in gas industry is an important concern. Technical personnel monitor troubleshooting of gas system. However limited number of investigations have studied the effect of airborne exposure to natural gas. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of occupational exposure to natural gas compounds on cholinergic activity and plasma thiol groups. Plasma thiol was evaluated to show the balance between the generation and deactivation of free radicals. Methods: This research is a descriptive with comparative design that was carried out in Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari Gas Company in the year of One hundred ninety eighty eight and One hundred ninety eighty nine. In this study, eighty men workers from the technical personnel of the gas company as the exposed group and also eighty men employees from the administrative section of the company were selected as the control group. Demographic information including age, work experience and smoking was collected using a worksheet. The health statue of subjects was evaluated by their medical examination file. All participants in the study had no specific disease and did not use particular drug. Subjects fill General Health Questionnaire for entering to study. The questionnaire assesses physical symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction and depression. The scoring method in this questionnaire is from 1 to 4 for options a through d. The test scores in each sub score was between 4 to 28. A score higher than 14 for each sub-scale indicate a probability of a problem. Because of statistical test age, official personnel, smoking and work experience in unexposed subjects were matched with the technical staff. Age of technical personnel was 37.41±6.42 year. At the end of the shift, for each person two mL blood was sampled and collected in an anticoagulant tube. Blood samples were centrifuged at three thousand RPM for ten min and plasma was prepared. Workers of natural gas industry have tasks such as trouble-shooting and adjustment activity. In these tasks leakage, filter replacement and regulator adjustment was performed. In addition, technical staff monitor the various station daily. Health risk was determined by the levels of plasma thiol as an indicator of oxidative stress and evaluating the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system in both groups of technical and administrative subjects. Thiol groups in body proteins are an important antioxidant and is one of the major intra- and extra cellular reducers. Thiol group exist in the structure of proteins and indicate antioxidant properties of plasma. It has an anti-oxidant role while by reacting with oxidizing agent reduced oxidative stress. Plasma thiol levels were measured using the Hu method. In this method, 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) is reduced by thiol groups to 2-nitro-5-mercaptic acid. Anion 2-Nitro-5-mercaptouric acid is a yellow compound. Therefore, the intensity of the dye produced in the reaction will be proportional to the total thiol concentration of the reductant. The absorbance of the thiol solution is measured at 412 nm. The outcome of results were analyzed by the software of SPSS version twenty one. The level of statistical significance was set at pre value of 0.05.Data normality were analyzed using Kolmogorov Smiirnov test. Data were presented by Mean ±Sd. for normal distribution of data, the difference between exposed and control subjects was evaluated by two sample student t-test. If samples have not normal like distribution Mean Whitney U test was applied. Results: The mean of age in technical workers of the gas company were 37.6 ± 41.42 years by work experience of 10.93 ± 5.37.There are no significant difference between work experience and age in the exposed and administrative workers. The results show that cholinergic activity in the technical personnel is significantly higher in comparison with that of the administrative staff by the pre value lower than 0/02. A total of seventy percent of the cholinergic activity in administrative staff people as base level was set at twenty four unit per liter. The activity of acetylcholine esterase in fifty nine percent of technical personnel was lower than this base value. The rate of decrease relative to baseline ranged from 0.57 to 24.52 U / L. The results of Logistic regression test show the chances of abnormalities of acetyl choline esterase activity in technical personnel are two times higher than to office personnel. The activity of acetyl choline esterase enzyme in the technical personnel has a significant relationship with the levels of thiol levels in the plasma. Median of thiol group in plasma of exposed group was 0.48 from 0.121 to 1.07 micro molar and for unexposed population was 0.5 micro molar by minimum value of 0.012 to maximum level of 0.94 micro molar. The level of plasma thiol groups was not significantly different between technical personnel and office subjects by the pre value lower than 0/642. Pearson correlation test showed that acetylcholinesterase activity in technical personnel was positively correlated by Pre value lower than 0.05 with plasma thiol groups (r = 0.3). One of the most important reasons for the change in cholinergic activity is the disruption of the balance of oxygen free radicals. The results of this study are in line with the theory that the decrease in cholinesterase activity is correlated with the decrease in plasma thiol groups. The low correlation coefficient between cholinergic activity and thiol group could be due to poor control of various factors to cause oxidative stress in studied subjects such as nutrition and environmental pollution and so on. The results did not show a significant difference in the amount of thiol groups between different tasks of natural gas industry. Conclusion: Investigating the damaging factor in natural gas workers is one of the most important factors in the health controlling among the energy producing industries. Researches have shown no clear perspective on the long exposure for occupational exposure in natural gas industry. In order to prevent the toxicity of chemical agent in the workplace, biological monitoring of workers is an important for the control of chemical exposure. Several decades ago, investigation of enzymatic activity is a suitable biomarker for chemical exposure monitoring. Consequently, odorant compound due to their Organo sulphur structure cause increase in the para sampatic activity then could be effect in the health of technical subjects in gas industry. In this study, the level of thiol group in technical personnel was lower than in office workers but this relationship was not significant. The lack of difference between plasma thiol groups in the exposed subjects and official workers could be related to variation of the compound containing the thiol group. The toxicity of natural gas was not sufficient to reduce plasma thiol group in exposed people. © 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

One change is the inclusion of emissions from outside of the boundaries of the State if they are associated with energy use within NY; the traditional inventory considered emissions only within the State. The new legislation also mandated that methane emissions be compared with carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame rather than the 100-year time frame previously used by NY and still used by virtually all other governments globally. This reflected the desire of NY's policymakers for a tool that evaluates emissions from the standpoint of energy consumption and that more heavily weighs the role of methane as an agent of warming over the next few decades. This paper compares emissions based on the new approach for GHG reporting with the traditional inventory. The traditional inventory is driven almost entirely by carbon dioxide emissions. As of 2015, these carbon dioxide emissions had declined by 15% since 1990 due to an 88% decrease in coal consumption and a 27% decrease in consumption of petroleum products, although consumption of natural gas had increased by 57%. Methane emissions increased by almost 30% between 1990 and 2015, largely due to the increased consumption of natural gas. According to the new GHG reporting rules, methane contributed 28% of all fossil-fuel emissions in 1990 and 37% in 2015. Total GHG emissions remained virtually unchanged from 1990 to 2015. © 2020 The Author(s).

Persons with heart failure (HF) are susceptible to these stressors. Objectives: This study sought to evaluate associations between UNGD activity and hospitalization among HF patients, stratified by both ejection fraction (EF) status (reduced [HFrEF], preserved [HFpEF], not classifiable) and HF severity. Methods: We evaluated the odds of hospitalization among patients with HF seen at Geisinger from 2008 to 2015 using electronic health records. We assigned metrics of UNGD activity by phase (pad preparation, drilling, stimulation, and production) 30 days before hospitalization or a frequency-matched control selection date. We assigned phenotype status using a validated algorithm. Results: We identified 9,054 patients with HF with 5,839 hospitalizations (mean age 71.1 ± 12.7 years; 47.7% female). Comparing 4th to 1st quartiles, adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for hospitalization were 1.70 (1.35 to 2.13), 0.97 (0.75 to 1.27), 1.80 (1.35 to 2.40), and 1.62 (1.07 to 2.45) for pad preparation, drilling, stimulation, and production metrics, respectively. We did not find effect modification by HFrEF or HFpEF status. Associations of most UNGD metrics with hospitalization were stronger among those with more severe HF at baseline. Conclusions: Three of 4 phases of UNGD activity were associated with hospitalization for HF in a large sample of patients with HF in an area of active UNGD, with similar findings by HFrEF versus HFpEF status.

Air pollution may be elevated in these areas and may vary by drilling type (conventional and unconventional), production volume and gas flaring. Impacts of NGD on paediatric asthma are largely unknown. This study quantifies associations between specific NGD activities and paediatric asthma hospitalizations in Texas. Methods: We leveraged a database of Texas inpatient hospitalizations between 2000 and 2010 at the zip code level by quarter to examine associations between NGD and paediatric asthma hospitalizations, where our primary outcome is 0 vs ≥1 hospitalization. We used quarterly production reports to assess additional drilling-specific exposures at the zip code-level including drilling type, production and gas flaring. We developed logistic regression models to assess paediatric asthma hospitalizations by zip code-quarter-year observations, thus capturing spatiotemporal exposure patterns. Results: We observed increased odds of ≥1 paediatric asthmahospitalization in a zip code per quarter associated with increasing tertiles of NGD exposure and show that spatiotemporal variation impacts results. Conventional drilling, compared with no drilling, is associated with odds ratios up to 1.23 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13, 1.34], whereas unconventional drilling is associated with odds ratios up to 1.59 (95% CI: 1.46, 1.73). Increasing production volumes are associated with increased paediatric asthma hospitalizations in an exposure-response relationship, whereas associations with flaring volumes are inconsistent. Conclusions: We found evidence of associations between paediatric asthma hospitalizations and NGD, regardless of drilling type. Practices related to production volume may be driving these positive associations. ©2020 The Author(s) all rights reserved.

Due to the previous unavailability of high temporal resolution natural gas consumption data, the pursuit of this policy agenda has largely occurred in the absence of a thorough understanding of hourly variations in the intensity of household natural gas use. These variations can have important downstream impacts on the electricity system once electrification has been achieved. This study presents a series of analyses which are based upon a novel dataset of hourly interval natural consumption data obtained for (N = 17,072) households located within a low-income portion of Southern California Gas Company's service territory. Results indicate that diurnal patterns of hourly natural gas use largely coincide with the timing of daily peak electricity loads. These findings suggest that the aggressive electrification of residential end-use appliances has the potential to exacerbate daily peak electricity demand, increase total household expenditures on energy, and, in the absence of a fully decarbonized electrical grid, likely result in only limited greenhouse gas emissions abatement benefits. © 2020 The Author(s).

Methods: The microenvironment variabilities in each stage of the total trip were analyzed. Exposure doses for the different commute processes were estimated based on the heart rates of volunteers. Experimental measurements were taken during peak traffic hours in July and October (summer and autumn) on two typical commute routes, for a total of 36 trips. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the effects of different variables on commuter exposures. Results: On the same route, the average PM exposure concentration of bus commuters was higher than those of subway commuters. For example, on Route 1 in the case study, the average PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 exposure concentrations of bus commuters were 71.6%, 19%, and 10.4% higher, respectively, than those of subway commuters. In the ground transportation mode, the exposure concentration of bus commuters was affected by the type of vehicle. Particle concentrations were significantly higher inside compressed natural gas (CNG) buses, than in pure electric (PE) buses, and in summer, the PM10 concentration in a CNG bus was 4.3 times higher than that in a PE bus. In a CNG bus, commuters in the back door area suffered the highest PM10 exposure concentration (179.6 μg/m3), followed by those in the rear of the carriage (142.8 μg/m3), and then those in the front door area (105.4 μg/m3). Conclusion: Commuters’ avoidance of ground traffic sources, effective ventilation systems in buses, and the use of screens in subway systems can all help to lower the PM exposure of commuters. For all the modes of transportation in our study, the hottest spots for PM exposure appeared in the period when commuters were waiting for transit vehicles to arrive. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Bus; Commuter exposure; Inhaled dose; PM concentration; Subway; Traffic micro-environment,commuting; concentration (composition); experimental study; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public transport; railway transport; urban pollution; urban transport; variance analysis; China; Shaanxi; Xian,"Qiu, Z.; School of Automobile, Chang’an Road, China; эл. почта: qzw@chd.edu.cn",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,2052336X,,,,English,J.

Hot water and steam are one of the significant requirements in the industries, and to fulfill this requirement, natural gas boilers are commonly used by the industries. However, due to the vast usage of conventional boilers, the emission of CO2 increases in the environment. Therefore, Solar Thermal Collectors (STC) gain the importance over natural gas boilers as green energy products in the industry to generate hot water and steam. The performance of STC depends on the different factors such as solar irradiation, non-shading area, cost, and heating capacity. The objective of this pre-feasibility study is to see the technical viability of the Solar Hot Water (SHW) system in order to fulfill the industrial hot water requirement. It can be observed from the result that SHW system is capable of generating averagely 614.75kW/day which can save 123.93 KG of CO2. Furthermore, the performance of the different type of solar collectors is also analyzed comprehensively.

Design of such mufflers relies heavily on general guidelines. However, these guidelines are not suitable for complex mufflers; instead, computer-based optimization provides an effective means of design. Optimization of a plug flow muffler is conducted in this work with a multi-objective (transmission loss and pressure drop) finite element simulation-based optimization using the efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm. The EGO algorithm is shown to be well suited for computationally expensive muffler optimization, performing vastly better than genetic algorithms, such as the commonly used NSGA-II algorithm. © 2020 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.",,Gas generators; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Mufflers; Noise generators; Efficient global optimization; Finite element simulations; Multi objective; NSGA-II algorithm; Plug flow; Transmission loss; Multiobjective optimization,,,Institute of Noise Control Engineering,07362501,,NCEJD,,English,Noise Control Eng J,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099275891

Conventionally, cavitation is considered to be induced when C ~ 1. However, experimental observations and several pipe bursts indicate that the CN may incorrectly predict the onset of cavitation. For example, when leakage occurs in the pipeline or a valve in the pipeline is opened, the resultant pressure loss generates a dynamic pressure wave with a small amplitude, which may lead to bubble formation, even though C ~ 1 is not satisfied. Hence, this paper proposes another CN based on the amplitude of the generated dynamic pressure wave, rather than the velocity, for ascertaining the onset of cavitation. The validity of the proposed CN was verified through experiments and a case study. The results indicated that the proposed CN can be effectively used for cavitation prediction induced by pressure fluctuations and for investigating phenomena such as pressure fluctuation, leakage, and corrosion in liquid pipelines, tanks, and pressure vessels, as well as the safety design of liquefied natural gas tanks and tankers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Cavitation number; Cavitation onset; Dynamic pressure wave; Experiments; Liquid pipeline,Cavitation; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas wells; Pipeline corrosion; Tanks (containers); Cavitation number; Dynamic pressures; Euler numbers; Liquid pipelines; Pressure fluctuation; Pressure loss; Safety design; Small amplitude; Pipelines; natural gas; Article; corrosion; flow rate; fluid flow; liquid; pipeline; prediction; pressure; priority journal; safety; validity,"Liu, C.; College of Pipeline and Civil Engineering, No. 66, West Changjiang Road, Huangdao District, China; эл. почта: chuyun_lcw@163.com",,Elsevier B.V.,13504177,,ULSOE,32615403.0,English,Ultrason.

In the context of global population growth, environmental degradation, and resource shortages, the interrelationship between the water, energy, and food has become increasingly important. In this paper, the city of Ordos in China was selected as a study area. Firstly, this paper sorted out relevant research literature and fully understood the concept of water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. Then, an optimization model of WEF system was constructed based on interval number multi-objective programming, which took the comprehensive coordination deviation degree of the WEF system security and carbon dioxide emission minimization as the target. At the same time, the optimization model was constructed with full consideration of constraints such as economic benefit, water resource consumption, energy production, food production and environmental pollution emission. The results showed that the production of coal, thermal power, hydropower, wind power, and food all show an upward trend. Among them, the production of hydropower has the largest change, and the food production has the smallest change. In terms of water resource utilization, food production has the largest allocation of water resources accounting for nearly 80%, followed by coal production, thermal power generation and hydropower generation. The smallest allocation is natural gas. In particular, the allocation of water for coal production and hydroelectric power generation has increased significantly. Finally, the policy recommendations were put forward to promote the sustainable development of WEF system in Ordos. The optimization research on the WEF system can help to ensure the WEF system security in Ordos and promote the sustainable development of WEF system, which also can provide reference for other regions. © 2020 by the authors.",Interval number multi-objective programming; Optimization research; Ordos; Water-energy-food system,carbon dioxide; coal; natural gas; water; computer simulation; environmental degradation; hydroelectric power; linear programing; literature review; numerical model; optimization; population growth; power generation; research work; sustainable development; Article; China; city; controlled study; economics; energy; energy yield; food; food industry; geothermal energy; hydropower; policy; pollution; sustainable development; trend study; water resource consumption; water resource utilization; wind power; catering service; water supply; China; Ordos; China; Cities; Food Supply; Water; Water Resources,"Chen, J.; Business School, China; эл. почта: chenjunfei@hhu.edu.cn",,MDPI AG,16617827,,,33076471.0,English,Int.

This work shows that defensible, provider- and time-specific emissions projections can be derived from two major factors: committed emissions from existing power plants and policy restrictions on future system characteristics. This letter introduces a bottom-up, power plant-based model that projects utility-specific annual average greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of electricity in the U.S. state of California for 2018-2050, believed to be the first openly available GHG emissions model with utility-specific projections. California is a useful case study for testing in part because of its strict regulatory GHG targets and the complexity of its electricity system, including limited asset ownership by utilities and substantial reliance on imported electricity. This plant-based approach to emissions projections bounds uncertainty in a way that less infrastructurally grounded approaches cannot. For example, emissions from unspecified sources of power can be estimated based on available plants. Based on historical power plant lifetimes, existing policy, and default model assumptions, the CO2 intensity of Californian electricity is projected to drop from 175 kg CO2/MWh (sales + losses, 2020) to 95 kg CO2/MWh by 2030, operationally decarbonizing by 2047. Upstream methane leakage increases GHG intensity of natural gas-fired power plants by about 30%, assuming a 100 year time horizon and national average estimates for leakage (which likely underestimate leakage for California). Although drivers like market conditions also affect future outcomes, California's current policy targets do not appear to require early retirement for utility generation assets, though up to about two gigawatts of extant in-state merchant capacity might be affected. Under current policy, new generating assets must either comply with the 100% clean electricity standard by 2045 or stop selling in California before the end of their expected useful life. © 2020 The Author(s).

The proposition has been validated with the generalized structural equation modeling approach with a cross-sectional dataset of 825 residents from China’s Fuling shale gas field. Results indicate that the influence of benefit perception on residents’ overall attitude outweighs that of risk perception. Moreover, residents’ perceived fairness, affective feeling, and trust in regulatory agencies have positive influences on their overall attitude, primarily via their risk and benefit perceptions, in decreasing order of influences. Finally, we also find that residents’ attitudes have been significantly influenced by their socio-demographic factors, including age, residential area, and political ideology. Thus, our study extends the literature with theoretical and empirical models by exploring the influences factors of local residents’ attitudes toward SGE, and results from our empirical survey provide insight into policy design to promote the acceptance of SGE. © 2020 by the authors.

The British Geological Survey only has an advisory role, as have ad hoc expert committees. I firstly define terms, and summarise the remits of the regulators and background history. Fourteen case histories are then discussed, comprising most of the unconventional exploitation to date; these cases demonstrate the failure of regulation of the geological aspects of fracking operations in the UK. The regulators let inadequacies in geological understanding, and even mendacious geological interpretations by the hydrocarbon operators slip through the net. There are potentially severe implications for environmental safety—if and when permits are granted. Geological pathways, if not properly understood and mitigated, may lead to long-term pollution of groundwater and surface water; methane and H2S emissions. Induced earthquakes have not been well regulated. The case histories demonstrate a laissez-faire and frequently incompetent regulatory regime, devised for the pre-unconventional era, and which has no geological oversight or insight. © 2020 by the author.

This was accomplished by introducing a pure culture of Thiobacillus denitrificans in a BTF that was successfully upgrading a biogas mimic (60:40 CH4:CO2) to &gt;97% methane using an enriched HM consortium. Nitrate was fed as the electron acceptor to oxidize H2S. The results revealed that a severe competition for hydrogen's electrons occurred between carbon dioxide and nitrate. Due to this competition, N:S loading rates of 16:1 were required to achieve &gt;98% H2S removal, a ratio which is four times greater than the theoretical N:S ratio for complete sulfur oxidation. However, such high nitrate loading rates (&gt;50 g N–NO3- m−3 h−1) had a negative impact on the BTF's biogas upgrading performance. An electron balance illustrated the increasing diversion of H2 electrons towards nitrate reduction as nitrate loading increased. Overall, this study showed that simultaneous biogas upgrading and H2S removal in a single bioreactor is possible, but that achieving high yields for both reactions requires further research in process and culture optimization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Biogas upgrading; Biological co-treatment; Biotrickling filter; Hydrogen sulfide; Renewable natural gas,Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Electrons; Filters (for fluids); Methane; Nitrates; Sulfur; Biological trickling filter; Culture optimizations; Electron acceptor; Hydrogenotrophic methanogens; Nitrate loading rates; Nitrate reduction; Sulfur oxidizing bacteria; Thiobacillus denitrificans; Loading; biogas; carbon dioxide; hydrogen; hydrogen sulfide; methane; nitrate; sulfur; biofuel; carbon dioxide; hydrogen sulfide; methane; nitric acid derivative; anoxic conditions; biogas; bioreactor; carbon dioxide; hydrogen sulfide; methane; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; oxidation; pollutant removal; Article; controlled study; culture optimization; feasibility study; hydrogen sulfide removal; methanogen; nitrate reducing bacterium; nonhuman; oxidation; reduction (chemistry); sulfur oxidizing bacterium; Thiobacillus denitrificans; bacterium; bioreactor; microbiology; Thiobacillus denitrificans; Bacteria; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Hydrogen; Hydrogen Sulfide; Methane; Nitrates,"Deshusses, M.A.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Box 90287, United States; эл. почта: marc.deshusses@duke.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,00456535,,CMSHA,32473468.0,English,Chemosphere,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085301018

The aim of the work was to study the kinetics of the crystallisation of oil emulsions during the formation of natural gas hydrates in them using the method of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The objects of the study were inverse oil emulsions containing 20, 40, 60, and 80 wt% of water. DSC is used under quasiequilibrium experiment conditions to study the kinetics of hydration of oil emulsions with gas. The study showed the applicability of the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model (KJMA) in order to describe the crystallisation process of inverse oil emulsions in a quasi-equilibrium DSC experiment. The kinetic parameters of the KJMA model in emulsions were determined for the processes of water drops conversion into ice, as well as their hydration with natural gas. It was shown that within the system ""natural gas-oil-water"" the process of ice formation is characterised by high values of the Avrami exponent (n >3) and the degree of freedom (l = 3), and the process of natural gas hydrate formation is characterised by low values of the Avrami exponent (n < 3) and medium degree of freedom (l = 1-3). It was shown that in a continuous aqueous phase, natural gas hydrates are formed by instantaneous nucleation in the form of separate onedimensional crystals; while in oil, hydrates are nucleated at a constant rate and, depending on the water content, grow in the form of disparate crystallites, shell, or spherulites.

As the imbalance between the supply and demand of water, energy, and food increases, a highly sensitive and fragile relationship gradually forms among water, energy, and food. In this paper, Inner Mongolia in China is selected as a research area. Firstly, synergy theory is applied to establish the framework of a water–energy–food system. Then, a multi-objective programming model is constructed, where the objective functions are defined to minimize the integrated deviation degree and pollutant emissions of the water–energy–food system. Meanwhile, maximization of the water benefit, energy production, and food production is also considered. In addition, the model takes economy, environment, water, energy, and food as constraints. Finally, a genetic algorithm is designed for accurately assessing the most promising results. The results show that the cooperation degree of the water–energy–food system in Inner Mongolia is getting better and better, and the pollutant emission from the water–energy–food system is decreasing. In 2020, the proportion of agricultural water consumption fell by 1%, while that of industrial water consumption rose by 0.48%. The production of coal, natural gas, and power are all showing an increasing trend. Among them, the increase of natural gas production is as high as 38,947,730 tons of standard coal. However, the proportions of coal, natural gas, and power change inconsistently, where the proportions of coal and natural gas increase while that of power decreases. Corn production accounts for more than 80% of the total, which is in the eldest brother position in the food industry structure. Besides, there are differences between the planned values and optimal values of decision variables. Finally, suggestions are put forward to improve the sustainable development of water–energy–food in Inner Mongolia. © 2020 by the authors.

The present study develops a conceptual framework to examine the psychological process of residents’ acceptance of local SGE, in which the impacts of trust, knowledge, and fairness are mediated by risk and benefit perceptions. Structural equation modeling has been applied to analyze the hypothesized relationships based on a dataset of 825 households in China’s largest shale gas field. Our results indicate that residents’ perceived fairness and trust positively affect their benefit perceptions and negatively affect their risk perceptions, which results in positive influences on acceptance, and knowledge of SGE’s environmental impacts positively affects perceived risks, which results in a negative influence on acceptance. Moreover, residents’ acceptance is primarily determined by their benefit perception, followed by perceived fairness, and knowledge is the least important determinant. Thus, our study contributes to the literature by exploring the structural relationships between various psychological predictors and the acceptance toward SGE, and the results from our empirical survey provide insight into designing appropriate strategies in the process of generating and communicating shale policies. © 2020 by the authors.

After political changes, the Czech government put forward a research program to determine if air pollution is really affecting human health. This program, later called the “Teplice Program”, was initiated in collaboration with scientists from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). This cooperation made possible the use of methods on the contemporary level. The very high concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter of 10 micrometers or less (PM10), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in the air showed, for the first time, the impact of air pollutants on the health of the population in mining districts: adverse pregnancy outcomes, the impact of air pollution on sperm morphology, learning disabilities in children, and respiratory morbidity in preschool children. A surprising result came from the distribution of the sources of pollution: 70% of PM10 pollution came from local heating and not from power plants as expected. Thanks to this result, the Czech government supported changes in local heating from brown coal to natural gas. This change substantially decreased SO2 and PM10 pollution and affected mortality, especially cardiovascular mortality. © 2020 by the author.

Drought's direct impacts on California's electric power sector are understood. Extremely low streamflow manifests as reduced hydropower availability, and if drought is also marked by elevated temperatures, these can increase building electricity demands for cooling. Collectively, these impacts force system operators to increase reliance on natural gas power plants, increasing market prices and emissions. However, previous investigations have relied mostly on ex post analysis of observational data to develop estimates of increases in costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to the 2012-2016 drought. This has made it difficult to control for confounding variables (e.g. growing renewable energy capacity, volatile natural gas prices) in assessing the drought's impacts. In this study, we use a power system simulation model to isolate the direct impacts of several hydrometeorological phenomena observed during the 2012-2016 drought on system wide CO2 emissions and wholesale electricity prices in the California market. We find that the impacts of drought conditions on wholesale electricity prices were modest (annual prices increased by $0-3 MWh-1, although much larger within-year increases are also observed). Instead, it was an increase in natural gas prices, punctuated by the 2014 polar vortex event that affected much of the Eastern U.S., which caused wholesale electricity prices to increase during the drought. Costs from the drought were very different for the state's three investor owned utilities. Overall, we find that increased cooling demands (electricity demand) during the drought may have represented a larger economic cost ($3.8 billion) than lost hydropower generation ($1.9 billion). We also find the potential for renewable energy to mitigate drought-cased increases in CO2 emissions to be negligible, standing in contrast to some previous studies. © 2020 The Author(s).

To improve the efficiency of these processes under haloalkaline conditions, a sulfate and thiosulfate reduction step can be included. The use of H2 /CO mixtures (as in syngas) instead of pure H2 was tested to investigate the potential cost reduction of the electron donor required. Syngas is produced in the gas-reforming process and consists mainly of H2, carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Purification of syngas to obtain pure H2 implies higher costs because of additional post-treatment. Therefore, the use of syngas has merit in the biodesulfurization process. Initially, CO inhibited hydrogen-dependent sulfate reduction. However, after 30 days the biomass was adapted and both H2 and CO were used as electron donors. First, formate was produced, followed by sulfate and thiosulfate reduction, and later in the reactor run acetate and methane were detected. Sulfide production rates with sulfate and thiosulfate after adaptation were comparable with previously described rates with only hydrogen. The addition of CO marginally affected the microbial community in which Tindallia sp. was dominant. Over time, acetate production increased and acetogenesis became the dominant process in the bioreactor. Around 50% of H2/CO was converted to acetate. Acetate supported biomass growth and higher biomass concentrations were reached compared to bioreactors without CO feed. Finally, CO addition resulted in the formation of small, compact microbial aggregates. This suggests that CO or syngas can be used to stimulate aggregation in haloalkaline biodesulfurization systems. © 2020 by the authors.

However, achieving such rapid reductions may depend on early retirement of coal- and natural gas-fired power plants. Here, we analyze future fossil fuel electricity demand in 171 energy-emissions scenarios from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), evaluating the implicit retirements and/or reduced operation of generating infrastructure. Although IAMs calculate retirements endogenously, the structure and methods of each model differ; we use a standard approach to infer retirements in outputs from all six major IAMs and - unlike the IAMs themselves - we begin with the age distribution and region-specific operating capacities of the existing power fleet. We find that coal-fired power plants in scenarios consistent with international climate targets (i.e. keeping global warming well-below 2 C or 1.5 C) retire one to three decades earlier than historically has been the case. If plants are built to meet projected fossil electricity demand and instead allowed to operate at the level and over the lifetimes they have historically, the roughly 200 Gt CO2 of additional emissions this century would be incompatible with keeping global warming well-below 2 C. Thus, ambitious climate mitigation scenarios entail drastic, and perhaps un-appreciated, changes in the operating and/or retirement schedules of power infrastructure. © 2020 The Author(s).

Therefore, infertility is considered a national priority in Qatar, a pronatalist society. This review article summarises the potential causes of infertility that are particularly prevalent in the Qatari population. The high rate of consanguinity leading to genetic abnormalities, the high incidence of metabolic disease, environmental contamination due to the rapid urbanization and oil and natural gas extraction procedures are discussed. In addition, the particular lifestyle of the Qatari population and the influence of religion and culture on sexual and reproductive behavior in an Arab/Islamic society are considered.

The bund system is extremely important for storage tanks of hazardous materials, such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), because the spilled LNG tends to vaporize rapidly with a low boiling temperature, and the bund contributes to reducing the vaporization rate by controlling the contact area of conductive heat transfer. Some regulations mandate the 110% rule for the bund design; however, a bund that complies with this rule may not hold all the fluid after a catastrophic tank failure, and some fluid would overtop from the bund wall to escalate the incident. Previous works have developed several predictive models of overtopping fraction for circular bunds, but these works only used a small set of experimental data, did not include the parameter of inclination angle, and failed to verify their performance for bunds of other shapes. This work collected all reported data of experimental studies on bund overtopping, and used them to develop novel predictive models of overtopping fraction for circular bunds, square bunds and bunds of arbitrary shapes. These predictive models were evaluated using a number of statistical performance measures. The findings were used to provide recommendations on the bund design and the future work. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Bund overtopping; Catastrophic failure; Secondary containment; Storage tank,Digital storage; Heat transfer; Hydraulic structures; Laws and legislation; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Boiling temperature; Catastrophic failures; Conductive heat transfer; Inclination angles; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Predictive modeling; Secondary containment; Statistical performance measures; Liquefied natural gas; article; computer assisted tomography; experimental study,"Zhang, B.; College of Safety Science and Engineering, China; эл. почта: bzhang@njtech.edu.cn",,Elsevier B.V.,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

The Yangtze River Economic Zone (YREZ), accounting for 21.4% of the total area of China, generates more than 40% of the total national gross domestic product and is an important component of the IECEs from China. However, little is known about the changes in the IECEs and their influencing factors in this area during the past decade. In this study, IECEs were calculated and their influencing factors were delineated based on an extended logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) model by introducing technological factors in the YREZ during 2008–2016. The following conclusions could be drawn from the results. (1) Jiangsu and Hubei were the leading and the second largest IECEs emitters, respectively. The contribution of the cumulative increment of IECEs was the strongest in Jiangsu, followed by Anhui, Jiangxi and Hunan. (2) On the whole, both the energy intensity and R&amp;D efficiency play a dominant role in suppressing IECEs; the economic output and investment intensity exert the most prominent effect on promoting IECEs, while there were great differences among the major driving factors in sub-regions. Energy structure, industrial structure and R&amp;D intensity play less important roles in the IECEs, especially in the central and western regions. (3) The year of 2012 was an important turning point when nearly half of these provinces showed a change in the increment of IECEs from positive to negative values, which was jointly caused by weakening economic activity and reinforced inhibitory of energy intensity and R&amp;D intensity. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, we compared PM2.5 levels and 24 h trends in brick workers’ homes that used wood or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cooking fuel. PM2.5 filter-based and real-time nephelometer data were collected for approximately 24 h in homes and outdoors. PM2.5 was significantly associated with fuel type and location (p &lt; 0.0001). Pairwise comparisons found significant differences between gas, indoor (geometric mean (GM): 79.32 μg/m3), and wood, indoor (GM: 541.14 μg/m3; p = 0.0002), and between wood, indoor, and outdoor (GM: 48.38 μg/m3; p = 0.0006) but not between gas, indoor, and outdoor (p = 0.56). For wood fuel homes, exposure peaks coincided with mealtimes. For LPG fuel homes, indoor levels may be explained by infiltration of ambient air pollution. In both wood and LPG fuel homes, PM2.5 levels exceeded the 24 h limit (25.0 μg/m3) proposed by the World Health Organization. Our findings suggest that increasing the adoption of LPG cookstoves and decreasing ambient air pollution in the Kathmandu valley will significantly lower daily PM2.5 exposures of brick workers and their families. © 2020 by the authors.

Contributions of unit wastewater treatment processes and electricity sources to the overall emissions are considered. Tucson (Arizona), Denver (Colorado), and Washington, DC were chosen for their distinct locations, climatic conditions, raw water sources, wastewater treatment technologies, and electric power mixes. Denver experienced a 20% reduction in treated wastewater volumes per person despite a 16% increase in population. In Washington, DC, the reduction was 19%, corresponding to a 16% increase in population, and in Tucson 14% despite a population growth of 3%. The electricity intensity per volume of treated wastewater was higher in Tucson (1 kWh m-3) than in Washington, DC (0.7 kWh m-3) or Denver (0.5 kWh m-3). Tucson's GHG emissions per person were about six times higher compared to Denver and four times higher compared to Washington, DC. Wastewater treatment facilities in Denver and Washington, DC generated a quarter to third of their electricity needs from onsite biogas and lowered their GHG emissions by offsetting purchases from the grid, including coal-generated electricity. The higher GHG emission intensity in Tucson is a reflection of coal majority in the electricity mix in the period, gradually replaced with natural gas, solar, and biogas. In 2018, the GHG reduction was 20% when the share of solar electricity increased to 14% from zero in 2016. In the analysis period, reduced wastewater volumes relative to the 2010 baseline saved Denver 44 000 MWh, Washington, DC 11 000 MWh and Tucson 7000 MWh of electricity. As a result, Washington, DC managed to forgo 21 000 metric tons of CO2-eq and Denver 34 000 metric tons, while Tucson's cumulative emissions increased by 22 000 metric tons of CO2-eq.

RNG is proposed as a climate friendly direct substitute for fossil natural gas (FNG), with the goal of enabling diverse natural gas users to continue operating without substantial infrastructure overhauls. The assumption that such substitution is climate friendly relies on a major condition that is unlikely to be met: namely, that RNG is manufactured from waste methane that would otherwise have been emitted to the atmosphere. In practice, capturable waste methane is extremely limited and is more likely to be diverted from a flare than from direct atmospheric release in a climate-conscious policy context, which means that RNG systems need to be more destructively efficient than a flare to provide climate benefits versus the likely alternative management strategy. Assuming demand levels consistent with the goal of using existing FNG infrastructure, RNG is likely to be derived from methane that is either intentionally produced or diverted from a flare, so essentially any methane leakage is climate additional. Further, in a decarbonizing system, RNG will likely compete with lower-emissions resources than FNG and thus provides fewer net emissions benefits over time. Anticipated leakage is climatically significant: literature estimates for methane leakage from biogas production and upgrading facilities suggest that leakage is in the 2%-4% range (mass basis), up to as much as 15%. Policy makers should consider that under reasonable leakage and demand assumptions, RNG could be climate intensive. © 2020 The Author(s).

The combination of DPSIR with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a useful method to study low-carbon evaluation because the AHP model has a special advantage in multi-indexes evaluation. This paper constructs the low-carbon economy evaluation system and comprehensively evaluates the numerical value of low-carbon economic development of China’s 30 regions from 2000 to 2015 by using the AHP method. It shows that the numerical value of low-carbon economy of China’s 30 regions varies in terms of growth rate. The numerical value of east regional low-carbon economy shows a pattern that is gradually higher than that of the west region. The numerical value of low carbon economic development in the south region is higher than that of the north region by degrees. In addition, based on the model of coordination degree in 2015, the result indicated that the four subsystems have primary coordination in the east area and bare coordination in the central and west areas. It is indicated that the four sub-indexes should be developed at the same pace and promoting the development of a low-carbon economy in the mid-west areas is the key in China. Finally, we proposed that environmental regulations and policies should be formulated to improve coordination in various aspects and various departments. Calculating the degree of low-carbon economic coupling coordination may be helpful for policy makers to formulate effective policies and take actions in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

There is scarcity of research papers at national level on its sociodemographic dimensions. The present paper aims to correlate death from lung cancer with certain demographic factors. Methods: Retrieved data from National Family Health Survey 4, Global Adult Tobacco Survey 2: India 2016-2017 and India: Health of the Nation's States were analyzed, as state and/or Union Territories unit of analysis. Spearman correlation coefficient and multivariate linear regression were used for finding out association with smoking, smokeless tobacco, alcohol consumption, second hand smoking, per capita income and use of clean fuel. Results: Except Kerala, most of the states with higher death rate were confined to north India. Smoking (r = 0.575, P= 0.001), SHS at home and work (r = 0.476, P= 0.008 and r = 0.374, P= 0.042, respectively) were significantly related to deaths from ca lung. On regression, clean fuel was found significantly associated with ca lung mortality.

We carried out our research in three of England’s communities impacted by shale gas development. To gather data, we conducted qualitative interviews and engaged in participant observation in all three communities and conducted a quantitative survey of residents. From our qualitative interviews it was apparent that the residents we spoke with experienced significant levels of stress associated with shale gas development in each community. Importantly, residents reported that stress was not only a reaction to development, but a consequence of interacting with industry and decision makers. Our quantitative findings suggest that a significant portion of residents 14.1% living near the shale gas sites reported high levels of stress (i.e., scoring 24 or more points) even while the mean IES-R score of residents living around the site is relatively low (i.e., 9.6; 95% CI 7.5–11.7). We conclude that the experiences, of the three English communities, reported in the qualitative interviews and quantitative survey are consistent with the reports of stress in the United States for those residents who live in shale gas communities. We therefore suggest that psychosocial stress is an important negative externality, which needs to be taken seriously by local planning officers and local planning committees when considering exploration and development permits for shale gas. © 2020 by the authors.

LPG is a highly flammable gas and leakage of LPG occurs major accidents. This paper approaches a smart technique for monitoring the leakage of LP Gas using IoT. In this research, a smart electronic system is developed for monitoring the presence of LP gas, Natural gas, butane, temperature, humidity, and heat index through a webserver. This system can trigger an alarm if the gas leakage is found or any measured parameters exceed the threshold value and also send an alarming SMS to the concerned authority. It can prevent the exploration occurs due to gas leakage. This system is integrated with sensors array which measures the important index related to gas presence and exploration. NodeMCU is a development board having an ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip that is used as a controller unit. The sensors data are fed into a NodeMCU and it imports these data to a website that is accessible from anywhere by using the internet. A 16∗2 LCD is connected with the NodeMCU for displaying the sensor's value onsite. A user can enquire about the gas presence by sending SMS also.

Today, the efficient and safe operation of storage activities are vital for companies. For this reason, companies have to pay attention to many factors when they are going to construct a warehouse. The most important factors are the structure of land, service availability, the geographical location, distance to customs or ports, climate, natural disaster risk, the social structure of the environment, distance to service markets, infrastructure availability (electricity, gas, natural gas), distance to hospitals and pharmacies. The goal of the paper is to evaluate the factors affecting the decision-making process of location selection of a warehouse for medical materials and services. As part of special material handling, medical goods need to be handled much more carefully. That is why, as far as the medical issues concerned additional criteria might be taken into consideration by the decision-makers. The priorities and alternatives will be discussed and ranked in the following part of this research.

The mechanism regulates emissions upstream by balancing the supply of CO2 emitting resources like coal, natural gas, oil, calcium carbonate, and the reduction of carbon stock in biotopes with the carbon uptake of forest, peatlands and human-made installations. Import and export border adjustments prevent the distortions of competition. Due to the vastly decentralized character of the emission sources and the certificate ownership, distributed-ledger technology is used. This helps to create an automated process to monitor this balance and to determine fair export border adjustments for European companies. CO2 allowances are tokenized to track them along the European value chains.

Yet, scholars have only recently begun to explore how these factors interact to create unique geographies of perception that defy the simplistic explanations suggested by not-in-my-backyard or yes-in-my-backyard labels. Using precisely geocoded well and survey data, we explore the interplay of political ideology, proximity and place in the context of public attitudes toward unconventional oil and natural gas development (UOGD) in the Marcellus Shale region of southern New York and northern Pennsylvania. For our full sample and similar to findings from recent national surveys on attitudes toward energy development, we found that respondents closer to UOGD were more supportive of it, a relationship that was moderated by political ideology with liberals or moderates located closer to UOGD more supportive than those located further away. However, when we examined these moderation effects within states, a different story emerged. For New York respondents, proximity did not appear to have a differential effect on conservatives vs. liberals/moderates. However, for Pennsylvania respondents, we observed opposing effects: conservatives were more supportive further away from development, while liberals/moderates were more supportive closer to development. Our results thus both reaffirm and challenge existing scholarship, highlighting the potential for middle range theorizing about geographies of perception in energy development. © 2020 The Author(s).

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether residential proximity to flaring from OGD was associated with shorter gestation and reduced fetal growth in the Eagle Ford Shale of south Texas. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative birth records from 2012 to 2015 (N = 23,487) and satellite observations of flaring activity during pregnancy within 5 km of maternal residence. Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were used to estimate associations between four outcomes (preterm birth, small-for-gestational age, continuous gestational age, and term birthweight) and exposure to a low (1–9) or high (≥10) number of nightly flare events, as compared with no exposure, while controlling for known maternal risk factors. We also examined associations with the number of oil and gas wells within 5 km using data from DrillingInfo (now Enverus). RESULTS: Exposure to a high number of nightly flare events was associated with a 50% higher odds of preterm birth [odds ratio ðORÞ =1:50 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.83)] and shorter gestation [mean difference = − 1:9 (95% CI: −2:8, −0:9) d] compared with no exposure. Effect estimates were slightly reduced after adjustment for the number of wells within 5 km. In stratified models these associations were present only among Hispanic women. Flaring and fetal growth outcomes were not significantly associated. Women exposed to a high number of wells (fourth quartile, ≥27) vs. no wells within 5 km had a higher odds of preterm birth [OR = 1:31 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.49)], shorter gestation [−1:3 (95% CI: −1:9, −0:8) d], and lower average birthweight [−19:4 (95% CI: −36:7, −2:0) g]. DISCUSSION: Our study suggests exposure to flaring from OGD is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. Our findings need to be con-firmed in other populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6394. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, a nationally representative population-based survey was analysed for this study. A total of 4751 women who had anthropometric (height and weight) data qualified for inclusion in this study. In linear regression modelling, charcoal use resulted in 3.08 kg (95% CI: 2.04, 4.12) and 0.81 kg/m2 (95%CI: 0.29, 1.33) reduction in weight and body mass index (BMI), respectively, compared to clean fuel (electricity, liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas) use. Use of wood resulted in much higher reduction in weight and BMI. In modified Poisson regression, charcoal users had 19% (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [aPR] = 0.81; 95%CI: 0.71, 0.92) and 29% (aPR = 0.71; 95%CI: 0.61, 0.83) decreased risk of overweight and obesity, respectively, compared to clean fuel users. Wood users had much higher decreased risk of overweight and obesity. In conclusion, biomass fuel use was associated with reduced body weight and BMI of Ghanaian women and is the first report on the relationship. However, it is important that our findings are confirmed and the biological mechanisms elucidated through rigorous study designs. © 2019, Springer Nature America, Inc.",Biomass fuel; BMI; Ghana; Household air pollution; Weight,"adult; biomass; body mass; cooking; female; Ghana; human; indoor air pollution; middle aged; obesity; prevalence; procedures; statistical model; wood; young adult; Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Biomass; Body Mass Index; Cooking; Female; Ghana; Humans; Linear Models; Middle Aged; Obesity; Prevalence; Women; Wood; Young Adult","Amegah, A.K.; Public Health Research Group, Ghana; эл. почта: aamegah@ucc.edu.gh",,Springer Nature,15590631,,,30804452.0,English,J.

In this regard, if the government and organizations do not pay attention to the proper infrastructure for gas installations, it will create irreparable risks for that society. The assessment and management of crisis in the various processes can play a key role in the planning, organization and training of the target community. Today, the importance of increasing crisis management is not overlooked. Social and HSE crisis are the most important issues in the gas company. Crisis management results can be used for educational planning and resource management. Also, using the results of the crisis assessment can identify the weak points of the organization. Identifying weaknesses within an organization enables management to regulate the organization's strategies based on them and reduce the impact of the crisis effectively. The assessment of the risk of gas pipelines will be assessed by various criteria, such as the environment of the gas supply network and the social conditions surrounding the gas supply network. In the event of a crisis in gas distribution networks, the best way to prevent an increase in the crisis in urban and industrial areas is to ensure a rapid shutdown of gas transmission. The responsible organizations should use high-reliability facilities and equipment to reduce the crisis in the failure of the gas transmission lines in the network. The technical status of the gas supply pipelines and their maintenance are among other criteria for assessing the gas supply risk. Crisis in gas networks can have irreparable effects due to the direct connection of the network with residents of cities. The crisis in the gas supply network is causing fire and explosion and poisoning, but it can also lead to social crises. Since the gas company is a social institution. Its problems can affect the community. Therefore, the crisis management issue in the gas supply network is very important. Qazvin Gas Company is a government organization with more than 350,000 shareholders and customers in the province. The inadequate and old infrastructure has put the risk of crisis in this province's gas distribution network as unacceptable. Such organizations need to invest in building a strategic thinking in crisis management on how to design and deliver services to their customers. The purpose of this research is to determine and rank critical factors and assess the risk of crisis in gas distribution networks. Methods: In this research, three types of major crises associated with gas supply networks were identified by using reliable sources and experts' opinion. An expert is someone who has a BSE degree in Industrial Engineering or HSE, as well as 10 years of experience in the gas industry. Toxicity, fire - explosion and social problems are the most important gas grid crisis. then 11 criticality indicators were defined for assessing the risk of crisis in gas network. Decision-making criteria in this study include: health problems, mortality, political problems, costs of line reconstruction, groundwater contamination, cost of stopping services, damage to people in the region, air pollution, reduced income, lack of trust in the organization, Fear and horror. In this study, FAHP technique and the FROMETHEEII fuzzy technique for ranking were used. One of the most efficient and comprehensive techniques for deciding multiple indicators is the analytical hierarchical process. It was first raised by Thomas L Satty in 1980. This method has many uses in solving managerial, economic and social problems. This method allows the formulation of the problem in a hierarchical manner. It is also possible to consider different quantitative and qualitative indices in problem solving. In this process, different options are involved in decision making and it is possible to analyze the sensitivity of indicators and sub-indicators. This process based on paired comparisons facilitates judgment and indicates the degree of compatibility and incompatibility of the decision. PROMETHEE was designed in 1985 by Branc & Vincke. It was developed by colleagues in 1994. This method can be called the ""Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation"", which, as it is known from the name, seeks to structurally address problems and use the actual values of the criteria for evaluation. Using the FAHP results, the weight determines the importance of each of the critical factors in gas networks. Using the results of the PROMETHEE, we can determine the weight and rank of contributing factor and sub contributing Factor of crisis risk for the gas network. Then using the obtained results, the grid risk assessment model was presented. The crisis risk assessment model is designed considering the importance of the type of crisis scenario. The proposed model is: (Formula Presented) where in: SN is level of severity of risk of crisis; Stox is level of Toxic severity of risk; Wtox is the weight of toxic severity of risk; Sex is level of explosive severity of risk; Wex is the weight of explosive severity; Scut is level of severity of Cut off gas network and Wcut is the weight of cut off gas network. Using the proposed model, the gas network of Qazvin province was evaluated as a case study. The results of mean and standard deviation were used to analyze the results. In order to confirm the validity and reliability of the questionnaires, the literature review and other questionnaires were used. Then, the questionnaire was adjusted and after the insertion of the necessary information, for content validity, was given to the experts. Following the necessary amendments, the original questionnaires were set up and approved by the experts. The reliability of the questionnaires was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. For this purpose, after answering all the experts, the reliability of the questionnaires was calculated using SPSS software, which is about α=0.74. According to the results, reliability of the questionnaire is reliable. In order to collect the data, the researchers examined the study environment and completed the checklist. Results: The results showed that the crises created in relation to the gas network with weight importance are not equal. So that the social crisis caused by the disruption of gas in the urban gas supply network is more important. The results showed that the crises created in relation to the gas network were not equal to the weight. So that the social crisis caused by disruption of gas in the urban gas supply network is more important than the crisis caused by Toxicity and explosion. This is due to the fact that poisoning and explosion can also lead to social crises that have a cumulative effect on the social crisis caused by the disruption of gas. The results showed that the most important crisis in the gas company was a definite gas. Also, the results showed that the main criteria in the risk of gas distribution network crisis are: proximity to residential buildings, population density, proximity to industrial towns, and the existence of vulnerable network conditions. The conditions of different regions of the case study showed that the best conditions for the gas supply network in the 3rd district are due to the low number of residential buildings, low population density, distance from industrial settlements, and the absence of vulnerable conditions. Conclusion: Several studies in recent years have found that the failure of the gas line is the main cause of the gas grid crisis. The main reason for this is the placement of pipes in the gas network and its regulators on the roads of cars and individuals. In these studies, gas regulators are classified as one of the most vulnerable parameters in the crisis assessment. Also, the main reason for the gas supply crisis in many studies is the structural weakness of the network and network vulnerability. Also, in some studies, environmental conditions and type of use around the gas distribution network are described as contributing factors of the risk of gas pipeline leakage and vulnerability factors in the gas distribution network. The main reason for definite gas as a crisis in the gas network is the use of the gas network in residential homes, which is the case in countries like Iran. According to the results of this study, it was determined that for assessing the risk of crisis in gas networks, it is necessary to determine the crisis factors and to integrate them in order to determine the risk of crisis in the gas network. In the risk assessment process, the impact of personal judgment of the evaluators on determining the risk level of a process is very important. In this research, using decision making models has been tried to minimize the impact of personal judgment of evaluators. One of the most important results in this study was the existence of social crises due to the cut off gas distribution networks. Therefore, the definitive gas crisis is of great importance. This is most common in developing countries that use natural gas in final consumers for heating and cooking. Therefore, this indicates that the government in these countries is required to invest from gas to electricity in order to prevent social crises, to reform the process of gas consumption and change energy consumption in homes and commercial and office facilities. The assessment of social crises is a new aspect of this research that has not been addressed in other researches. © 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

In order to cope up with this rising demand, more power plants are commissioned. Most of the power plants use fossil fuel to produce electricity, hence are subjected to emissions to air, water and soil. This study uses life cycle assessment approach to measure the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and its impact on global warming as well as to analyze the effect on climate change per unit kWh of electricity produced in a natural gas thermal power plant in the context of Bangladesh. The plant studied here comprises of different types of units and uses natural gas as fuel. The methods used in the analysis are CML 2001 and Eco-Indicator 99(H). The total GHG emission and climate change potential (CCP) from the natural gas thermal power plant were respectively 0.529 kg CO2 eq/kWh and 1.51E-8 DALY/kWh electricity generation. This study also shows that a natural gas combined cycle unit emits less greenhouse gas than any gas engine unit or modular unit. © 2020 IEEE.",Climate change; Environmental impact; Global warming; Greenhouse gas emission; Life cycle assessment; Natural gas power plant,Electric power generation; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Natural gas; Natural gas wells; Natural gasoline plants; Thermoelectric power plants; Climate change potentials; Eco-Indicator 99; Electricity generation; GHG emission; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Modular units; Natural gas combined cycles; Thermal power plants; Fossil fuel power plants,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781728173665,,,English,"IEEE Reg. 10 Symp., TENSYMP",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096424623

That is why people are turning fast to electric vehicles. Bangladesh has electric vehicles like easy bikes, auto-rickshaws, etc. also. In the recent future, the people of Bangladesh will be familiar with the electric car. Weare hoping that 8.5 % of cars will alter into electric cars within 2040 in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, our arrangement is not enough for the electric car at this moment. Two-thirds of Bangladesh's people are connected with electricity only, and we have insufficient land for new power plants. Hence, the upcoming electric load will be a burden for the country. But Electric cars will save natural gas and fuel in Bangladesh. Therefore, the solar charging system can be an effective solution to this problem. Bangladesh is generating 3% of electricity by solar at this time. To diminish these electric loads, we are designing a model to charge those electric cars by solar placing on road dividers at Dhaka-Chattogram national highway in Bangladesh. © 2020 IEEE.",charging station; electric car; power generation economics; solar energy,Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Electric bikes; Electric loads; Natural gasoline plants; Bangladesh; Effective solution; Electric cars; Pollution problems; Solar charging; Electric automobiles,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781728173665,,,English,"IEEE Reg. 10 Symp., TENSYMP",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096411518

Sufficient data existed in recent decades to support the adoption of precautionary public health policies relating to fossil fuels including shale exploration. Yet air quality and related public health impacts linked to ethical and environmental justice elements are often marginalized or missing in planning and associated decision making. Industry and government policies and practices, laws and planning regulations lagged well behind the science in the United Kingdom. This paper explores the reasons for this and what shaped some of those policies. Why did shale gas policies in England fail to fully address public health priorities and neglect ethical and environmental justice concerns. To answer this question, an interdisciplinary analysis is needed informed by a theoretical framework of how air pollution and climate change are largely discounted in the complex realpolitik of policy and regulation for shale gas development in England. Sources, including official government, regulatory and planning documents, as well as industry and scientific publications are examined and benchmarked against the science and ethical and environmental justice criteria. Further, our typology illustrates how the process works drawing on an analysis of official policy documents and statements on planning and regulatory oversight of shale exploration in England, and material from industry and their consultants relating to proposed shale oil and gas development. Currently the oil, gas and chemical industries in England continue to dominate and influence energy and feedstock-related policy making to the detriment of ethical and environmental justice decision making with significant consequences for public health. © 2020 by the authors.

The growth in California is partly associated with costly infrastructure developments that led to population expansion in the levee protected areas. Therefore, potential changes in the flood hazard could have significant socioeconomic consequences over levee protected areas, especially in the face of a changing climate. In this study, we examine the possible impacts of a warming climate on flood hazard over levee protected land in California. We use gridded maximum daily runoff from global circulation models (GCMs) that represent a wide range of variability among the climate projections, and are recommended by the California's Fourth Climate Change Assessment Report, to investigate possible climate-induced changes. We also quantify the exposure of several critical infrastructure protected by the levee systems (e.g. roads, electric power transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, petroleum pipelines, and railroads) to flooding. Our results provide a detailed picture of change in flood risk for different levees and the potential societal consequences (e.g. exposure of people and critical infrastructure). Levee systems in the northern part of the Central Valley and coastal counties of Southern California are likely to observe the highest increase in flood hazard relative to the past. The most evident change is projected for the northern region of the Central Valley, including Butte, Glenn, Yuba, Sutter, Sacramento, and San Joaquin counties. In the leveed regions of these counties, based on the model simulations of the future, the historical 100-year runoff can potentially increase up to threefold under RCP8.5. We argue that levee operation and maintenance along with emergency preparation plans should take into account the changes in frequencies and intensities of flood hazard in a changing climate to ensure safety of levee systems and their protected infrastructure. © 2020 The Author(s).

Limited evidence suggests a link between household fuel use and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship between indoor burning of biomass, kerosene, and natural gas with the subsequent risk of GI cancers. METHODS: During the period 2004–2008, a total of 50,045 Iranian individuals 40–75 years of age were recruited to this prospective population-based cohort. Upon enrollment, validated data were collected on demographics, lifestyle, and exposures, including detailed data on lifetime household use of different fuels and stoves. The participants were followed through August 2018 with <1% loss. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 962 participants developed GI cancers. In comparison with using predominantly gas in the recent 20-y period, using predominantly biomass was associated with higher risks of esophageal [hazard ratio (HR): 1.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 3.50], and gastric HR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.01, 3.31) cancers, whereas using predominantly kerosene was associated with higher risk of esophageal cancer (HR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.10, 3.10). Lifetime duration of biomass burning for both cooking and house heating (exclusive biomass usage) using heating-stoves without chimney was associated with higher risk of GI cancers combined (10-y HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.21), esophageal (10-y HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.30), gastric (10-y HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.23), and colon (10-y HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.54) cancers. The risks of GI cancers combined, esophageal cancer, and gastric cancer were lower when biomass was burned using chimney-equipped heating-stoves (strata difference p-values = 0:001, 0.003, and 0.094, respectively). Duration of exclusive kerosene burning using heating-stoves without chimney was associated with higher risk of GI cancers combined (10-y HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.11), and esophageal cancer (10-y HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.26). DISCUSSION: Household burning of biomass or kerosene, especially without a chimney, was associated with higher risk of some digestive cancers. Using chimney-equipped stoves and replacing these fuels with natural gas may be useful interventions to reduce the burden of GI cancers worldwide. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Also, comparing the differences in NH3 emission levels between the developed emission factors, which reflect the characteristics in Korea, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) values currently applied in Korea. The estimation showed that the NH3 emission factor for the LNG power plants was 0.0054 ton NH3/106Nm3, which is approximately nine times less than the EPA NH3 emission factor of 0.051 ton NH3/106Nm3 for LNG fuels of the industrial energy combustion sector currently applied in national statistics in Korea. The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) emission factor for LNG power plants was 0.0010 ton NH3/106Nm3, which is considerably lower than the EPA NH3 emission factor of 0.146 ton NH3/106Nm3 currently applied in national statistics in Korea for the LNG fuels of the industrial process sector. This indicated the need for developing an emission factor that incorporates the unique characteristics in Korea. The uncertainty range of the LNG stack NH3 emission factor developed in this study was ±10.91% at a 95% confidence level, while that of the SCR NH3 emission factor was –10% to +20% at a 95% confidence level, indicating a slightly higher uncertainty range than the LNG stack. At present, quantitative analysis of air pollutants is difficult because numerical values of the uncertainty are not available.

These data have important implications for developing best management practices for handling and waste disposal, or identifying the fluid in the event of accidental spill events. Here, we evaluated the elemental and isotope chemistry of UPP produced waters from 26 wells throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to determine any unique fluid chemistries that could be used for forensic studies. Compared to the Marcellus, UPP produced waters contain higher activities of total radium (226Ra + 228Ra) and higher 228Ra/226Ra ratios. As with the Marcellus Shale, elemental ratios (Sr/Ca) and isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) can distinguish UPP produced waters from many conventional oil and gas formations. Sr/Ca and 87Sr/86Sr ratios can fingerprint small fractions (∼0.1%) of UPP produced water in freshwater. However, because Marcellus and UPP produced waters display similar major elemental chemistry (i.e., Na, Ca, and Cl) and overlapping ratios of Sr/Ca and 87Sr/86Sr, 228Ra/226Ra ratios may be the best tracer to distinguish these waters. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Isotopes; Produced Water; Shale; Waste disposal; Appalachian basin; Best management practices; Conventional oil and gas; Elemental chemistries; Fluid chemistry; Isotope analysis; Marcellus shales; Overlapping ratio; Strontium compounds; arsenic; barium; boron; bromine; calcium; chloride; copper; fresh water; iron; isotope; lead; lithium; magnesium; potassium; radium 226; radium 228; sodium; strontium; strontium 86; strontium 87; sulfur; tracer; unclassified drug; uranium; water; natural gas; Article; gas; geochemical analysis; inorganic chemistry; isotope analysis; liquid waste; Ohio; Pennsylvania; priority journal; waste disposal; water analysis; West Virginia; oil and gas field; United States; waste water; water pollutant; Appalachian Region; Isotopes; Natural Gas; Ohio; Oil and Gas Fields; Pennsylvania; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; West Virginia",,,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,32322852.0,English,Environ.

Many state and federal governmental agencies rely on the third-party FracFocus online registry for disclosure of chemical ingredients in fracturing fluids, but withholding chemicals as trade secrets is common. In 2016, a new format, known as the systems approach was widely encouraged as a method of reducing withholding by decoupling disclosed chemicals from their functions, protecting against reverse-engineering of fracture fluid formulas by competitors. In this study, we assess the extent to which elevated use of the systems approach in FracFocus version 3.0 translated into greater chemical disclosure. Methods: We analysed 108 137 disclosure forms submitted to FracFocus between Jan 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2018, to estimate the effect of expanded use of the systems approach on chemical withholding. We compared the proportion of forms withholding at least one chemical ingredient across time, between approaches, and by state and drilling operator. Findings: Since the 2016 expansion of the systems approach, 15 677 (82%) of systems approach forms have withheld an ingredient. 13 462 (89%) of 15 062 traditional FracFocus version 3.0 forms withheld an ingredient. In the quarter following the transition (July, to September, 2016), 1211 (93%) of 1304 traditional forms withheld an ingredient, compared with only 958 (76%) of 1262 systems approach forms. However, withholding rates increased throughout 2017 and, by 2018, 6949 (87%) of 8016 systems approach forms were withholding ingredients. At the end of our analysis period in the fourth quarter of 2018, systems approach forms had even greater withholding (903 [88%] of 1025 forms) than did traditional forms (855 [85%] of 1004 forms). We did not find that states or operators that submitted more systems approach forms had lower withholding. Interpretation: The systems approach has not reduced FracFocus chemical withholding, which continues to occur in around 87% of well fracture disclosures. FracFocus might not be an appropriate substitute for regulatory action, and measures are urgently needed for environmental and public safety.

Exploiting regression discontinuity designs based on the exact starting dates of winter heating across different cities, we estimate the contemporaneous impact of winter heating on air pollution and health. We find that turning on the winter heating system increased the weekly Air Quality Index by 36% and caused 14% increase in mortality rate. This implies that a 10-point increase in the weekly Air Quality Index causes a 2.2% increase in overall mortality. People in poor and rural areas are particularly affected by the rapid deterioration in air quality; this implies that the health impact of air pollution may be mitigated by improved socio-economic conditions.

The generation of ideas is vital to develop more efficient exploitation technologies for CSG. Innovative ideas originate from the recombination of existing knowledge elements according to recombinative innovation. The previous literature has focused on exploring an abundance of combinations, which leads to blindness towards idea generation. For this reason, it is critical to search for more valuable matching patterns among the redundant combinations of elements. In line with this concept, this paper proposes a method that consists of three phases: the collection of knowledge elements, the analysis of knowledge element depth and diversity, and the analysis of knowledge element relationships. In this process, we take the patent document as the carrier of knowledge recombination and identify the optimization method in the reorganization process by means of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and association rules. This method is expected to assist in sparking better ideas for CSG exploitation technologies. © 2020 by the authors.

To date, no study has comprehensively evaluated a large suite and variety of biomarkers in household air pollution (HAP) studies in concert with exposure and outcome data. The Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial is a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) fuel/stove randomized intervention trial enrolling 800 pregnant women in each of four countries (i.e., Peru, Guatemala, Rwanda, and India). Their offspring will be followed from birth through 12 months of age to evaluate the role of pre-and postnatal exposure to HAP from biomass burning cookstoves in the control arm and LPG stoves in the intervention arm on growth and respiratory outcomes. In addition, up to 200 older adult women per site are being recruited in the same households to evaluate indicators of cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and cancer outcomes. OBJECTIVES: Here we describe the rationale and ultimate design of a comprehensive biomarker plan to enable us to explore more fully how exposure is related to disease outcome. METHODS: HAPIN enrollment and data collection began in May 2018 and will continue through August 2021. As a part of data collection, dried blood spot (DBS) and urine samples are being collected three times during pregnancy in pregnant women and older adult women. DBS are collected at birth for the child. DBS and urine samples are being collected from the older adult women and children three times throughout the child’s first year of life. Exposure biomarkers that will be longitudinally measured in all participants include urinary hydroxy-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic chemical metabolites, metals/metalloids, levoglucosan, and cotinine. Biomarkers of effect, including inflammation, endothelial and oxidative stress biomarkers, lung cancer markers, and other clinically relevant measures will be analyzed in urine, DBS, or blood products from the older adult women. Similarly, genomic/epigenetic markers, microbiome, and metabolomics will be measured in older adult women samples. DISCUSSION: Our study design will yield a wealth of biomarker data to evaluate, in great detail, the link between exposures and health outcomes. In addition, our design is comprehensive and innovative by including cutting-edge measures such as metabolomics and epigenetics. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5751. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The resulting household air pollution (HAP) is a leading environmental risk factor, accounting for an estimated 1.6 million premature deaths annually. Previous interventions of cleaner stoves have often failed to reduce exposure to levels that produce meaningful health improvements. There have been no multicountry field trials with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves, likely the cleanest scalable intervention. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the design and methods of an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) of LPG stove and fuel distribution in 3,200 households in 4 LMICs (India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda). METHODS: We are enrolling 800 pregnant women at each of the 4 international research centers from households using biomass fuels. We are randomly assigning households to receive LPG stoves, an 18-month supply of free LPG, and behavioral reinforcements to the control arm. The mother is being followed along with her child until the child is 1 year old. Older adult women (40 to &lt;80 years of age) living in the same households are also enrolled and followed during the same period. Primary health outcomes are low birth weight, severe pneumonia incidence, stunting in the child, and high blood pressure (BP) in the older adult woman. Secondary health outcomes are also being assessed. We are assessing stove and fuel use, conducting repeated personal and kitchen exposure assessments of fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2:5 lm (PM2:5), carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon (BC), and collecting dried blood spots (DBS) and urinary samples for biomarker analysis. Enrollment and data collection began in May 2018 and will continue through August 2021. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02944682). CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide evidence to inform national and global policies on scaling up LPG stove use among vulnerable populations. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This paper describes the exposure data collection for the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN), a multicountry randomized controlled trial of liquefied petroleum gas stoves and fuel among 3,200 households in India, Rwanda, Guatemala, and Peru. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of the exposure assessment are to estimate the exposure contrast achieved following a clean fuel intervention and to provide data for analyses of exposure–response relationships across a range of personal exposures. METHODS: Exposure measurements are being conducted over the 3-y time frame of the field study. We are measuring fine particulate matter [PM &lt; 2:5 lm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2:5)] with the Enhanced Children’s MicroPEM™ (RTI International), carbon monoxide (CO) with the USB-EL-CO (Lascar Electronics), and black carbon with the OT21 transmissometer (Magee Scientific) in pregnant women, adult women, and children &lt;1 year of age, primarily via multiple 24-h personal assessments (three, six, and three measurements, respectively) over the course of the 18month follow-up period using lightweight monitors. For children we are using an indirect measurement approach, combining data from area monitors and locator devices worn by the child. For a subsample (up to 10%) of the study population, we are doubling the frequency of measurements in order to estimate the accuracy of subject-specific typical exposure estimates. In addition, we are conducting ambient air monitoring to help characterize potential contributions of PM2:5 exposure from background concentration. Stove use monitors (Geocene) are being used to assess compliance with the intervention, given that stove stacking (use of traditional stoves in addition to the intervention gas stove) may occur. CONCLUSIONS: The tools and approaches being used for HAPIN to estimate personal exposures build on previous efforts and take advantage of new technologies. In addition to providing key personal exposure data for this study, we hope the application and learnings from our exposure assessment will help inform future efforts to characterize exposure to household air pollution and for other contexts. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6422. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This study quantifies the 2000-2015 urban high-resolution spatiotemporal patterns of China's FFCO2 emissions under the impact of the land-use and land-cover change. Multi-source data were used together with various up-to-date geostatistics and spatial analysis methods. FFCO2 emissions were determined to rise over the 15 years in the highest emitting cities in the South and East of China. The high-value clusters inside of all cities expanded outward from their city centers and in some cases transferred to economic development zones or new city centers, while the expansion speeds and variation time were found to differ significantly. We found further that then FFCO2 emissions spatial distribution is interconnected with diverse factors: urbanization, and either croplands (rainfed, irrigated, and post-flooding) or native vegetation, being the two most important. As expected, the increase in urban areas was associated with increased FFCO2 emissions, while the wettability in croplands or the increase in native vegetation have an association with the decrease of FFCO2 emissions. Unlike previous studies, we have found no change associated with changes in water cover. Finally, while the primary source of FFCO2 emissions is still coal, there has been a gradual move to cleaner energy (natural gas in Beijing) or more efficient industrial processes (Wuxi and Dalian), although diverse industrial structures and energy efficiencies exist. Over time, the current spatial patterns of FFCO2 emissions in China will conflict with these trends at the macroscale. © 2020 The Author(s).

Increases in nonlocal, specialized workers to meet the demands of this complex industry have been suggested to influence the rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in counties with shale drilling activity; these associations may vary geographically. In this multiregion analysis, we examine the associations between shale drilling activity and rates of 3 reportable STIs in Colorado, North Dakota, and Texas, states with active shale drilling. Methods We obtained annual reported rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, number of active shale wells from Enverus (formerly known as DrillingInfo), and sociodemographic covariates from the US Census Bureau. We used multivariable mixed-effects Poisson regression modeling to estimate rate ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for potential confounders and secular trends. Results In Texas, county-years with high drilling activity had 10% increased rates of chlamydia (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17) and 15% increased rates of gonorrhea (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04-1.28), compared with county-years with no drilling. No statistically significant associations were reported for syphilis or for any STIs in Colorado or North Dakota. Conclusions Associations between shale drilling and chlamydia and gonorrhea in Texas may reflect increased risk in areas with higher drilling activity and a greater number of major metropolitan areas. Interstate differences highlight the need for local epidemiology to prioritize community health policies. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,adolescent; adult; Article; chlamydiasis; Colorado; confidence interval; female; gonorrhea; human; major clinical study; male; North Dakota; oil industry; oil shale; sexually transmitted disease; syphilis; Texas; United States; chlamydiasis; fracking; gonorrhea; oil industry; sexually transmitted disease; syphilis; United States; fossil fuel; natural gas; Adult; Chlamydia Infections; Female; Fossil Fuels; Gonorrhea; Humans; Hydraulic Fracking; Male; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Industry; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Syphilis; Texas; United States,"Johnson, N.P.; Departments of Environmental Health Sciences, 60 College St, United States; эл. почта: nicole.deziel@yale.edu",,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,01485717,,STRDD,31923139.0,English,Sex.

The syngas (CO and H2) from coal, natural gas, and biomass is one of the most promising feedstocks, but it is still a challenge because of the unsatisfied efficacy. Despite many efforts to combine several individual reactions to realize the ethanol production from syngas, it remains a great challenge in direct syngas-to-ethanol conversion to meet the high-level ethanol productivity. Here, we report the catalyst with a powerful siliceous zeolite support and a core-shell structure, which is achieved by fixing RhMn nanoparticles within Silicate-1 zeolite crystals (RhMn@S-1), could remarkably boost the ethanol production from direct syngas conversion, decidedly outperforming the previous Rh-based catalysts. This work provides a new route for design and preparation of highly efficient catalyst for ethanol production from syngas. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.The direct transformation of syngas into C2-oxygenates (e.g., ethanol) is in great demand, but it is still challenging because of the low selectivity and poor catalyst stability. Here, we overcome the issues and report a zeolite-fixation methodology to strengthen the transformation. By employing the extensively investigated RhMn catalyst, the silicate-1 zeolite-fixed RhMn nanoparticles with core-shell structure (RhMn@S-1) exhibit high efficacy for the C2 oxygenates production from syngas, giving oxygenate selectivity at 40.3% under CO conversion of 42.4% (C2-oxygenate selectivity at 88.3% in the total oxygenates), which decidedly outperforms the previous catalysts in direct syngas-to-ethanol transformation. Multiple studies demonstrate that the rigid zeolite framework efficiently stabilizes the Mn-O-Rhδ+ structure, known as the crucial site for C2-oxygenate formation. In the long-term test, the RhMn@S-1 catalyst exhibits constant C2-oxygenate productivities with superior durability. This investigation demonstrates the powerful siliceous zeolite support in the C2-oxygenate production, which has not been explored previously. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Xiao and colleagues successfully designed a powerful siliceous zeolite support and a core-shell structure, which is achieved by fixing RhMn nanoparticles within Silicate-1 zeolite crystals (RhMn@S-1), could remarkably boost the ethanol production from direct syngas conversion.

Elevations of fine particulate matter <2.5 µm (PM2.5), have been documented in areas surrounding drilling operations during well stimulation. Furthermore, many communities are experiencing increased industrial activities and probable UNGD air pollutant exposures. Recent studies have associated UNGD emissions with health effects based on distances from well pads. In this study, PM2.5 filter samples were collected on an active gas well pad in Morgantown, West Virginia, and three locations downwind during hydraulic stimulation. Fine particulate samples were analyzed for major and trace elements. An experimental source identification model was developed to determine which elements appeared to be traceable downwind of the UNGD site and whether these elements corresponded to PM2.5 measurements. Results suggest that 1) magnesium may be useful for detecting the reach of UNGD point source emissions, 2) complex surface topographic and meteorological conditions in the Marcellus Shale region could be modeled and confounding sources discounted, and 3) well pad emissions may be measurable at distances of at least 7 km. If shown to be more widely applicable, future tracer studies could enhance epidemiological studies showing health effects of UNGD-associated emissions at ≥15 km. © 2020 by the authors.

Optical gas imaging-based leak detection and repair (LDAR) surveys are commonly used to address fugitive methane emissions or leaks. Despite widespread use, there is little empirical measurement of the effectiveness of LDAR programs at reducing long-term leakage, especially over the scale of months to years. In this study, we measure the effectiveness of LDAR surveys by quantifying emissions at 36 unconventional liquids-rich natural gas facilities in Alberta, Canada. A representative subset of these 36 facilities were visited twice by the same detection team: an initial survey and a post-repair re-survey occurring ∼0.5-2 years after the initial survey. Overall, total emissions reduced by 44% after one LDAR survey, combining a reduction in fugitive emissions of 22% and vented emissions by 47%. Furthermore, >90% of the leaks found in the initial survey were not emitting in the re-survey, suggesting high repair effectiveness. However, fugitive emissions reduced by only 22% because of new leaks that occurred between the surveys. This indicates a need for frequent, effective, and low-cost LDAR surveys to target new leaks. The large reduction in vent emissions is associated with potentially stochastic changes to tank-related emissions, which contributed ∼45% of all emissions. Our data suggest a key role for tank-specific abatement strategies as an effective way to reduce oil and gas methane emissions. Finally, mitigation policies will also benefit from more definitive classification of leaks and vents. © 2020 The Author(s).

Currently used frequency-estimation methods are reviewed and broadened in this article to include critical factors of cause, severity, and uncertainty that contribute to risk. A Bayesian probabilistic analysis characterizes the aleatoric historical occurrence frequencies given imperfect sampling. Frequencies for the three main storage facility types in the United States (depleted oil-and-gas field storage, aquifer storage, solution-mined salt cavern storage) are generally on the order of 3 to 9 × 10–2 occurrences, of all causes (surface, well integrity, subsurface integrity) and severities (nuisance, serious, catastrophic), per facility-year. Loss of well integrity is associated with many, but not all, occurrences either within the subsurface or from there up to the surface.

However, the effect of background electric fields is yet to be ascertained. The aim of this study was to test the following hypotheses: desensitization by low-dose immunotherapy is associated with reduced calcium ion influx during electric field exposure; the effect of low-dose immunotherapy on intracellular calcium ion concentration does not depend on electric field exposure; and the intracellular calcium ion concentration is amplified by electric field exposure. The experimental design was balanced and orthogonal. Intracellular lymphocytic calcium ion concentrations were assayed in 47 patients, following incubation with picogram amounts of 12 test allergens, using a cell-permeable calcium-sensing ratiometric fluorescent dye and fluorescence spectroscopy, both at baseline and following successful provocation neutralization treatment with low-dose immunotherapy. Duplicates were also exposed to an electric field which replicated the frequency spectrum measured in a non-Faraday shielded room. A significant or trend-level main effect was found for low-dose immunotherapy for: benzoate; formaldehyde; metabisulfite; natural gas; nitrosamines; organophosphates; salicylate; azo-dyes and precursors; nickel; and petrol (gasoline) exhaust. Significant or trend-level main effects for electric field exposure were observed for: formaldehyde; mercury (inorganic); natural gas; nickel; nitrosamines; petrol exhaust; salicylate; benzoate; and metabisulfite. There was no evidence of a statistical interaction between these two factors. Electric field exposure was associated with a higher intracellular calcium ion concentration. There was support for all three hypotheses. The results suggest that patients may experience increased sensitivity to allergens as a result of exposure to everyday electric fields. © 2019 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",allergy; calcium signaling; electric field; immunotherapy; lymphocyte activation,"azo dye; bisulfite; calcium ion; fluorescent dye; formaldehyde; gasoline; mercury; natural gas; nickel; nitrosamine; organophosphate; salicylic acid; calcium; calcium channel; adult; Article; calcium transport; clinical article; cohort analysis; desensitization; electric field; exposure; female; human; immunotherapy; male; spectrofluorometry; trend study; calcium signaling; electromagnetism; hypersensitivity; immunology; ion transport; lymphocyte; metabolism; middle aged; procedures; Adult; Calcium; Calcium Channels; Calcium Signaling; Desensitization, Immunologic; Electromagnetic Fields; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Ion Transport; Lymphocytes; Male; Middle Aged","Puri, B.K.; C.A.R., Trumpington Street, United Kingdom; эл. почта: bpuri@cantab.net",,De Gruyter,15533840,,,31421039.0,English,J.

This study explores the potential for sulfide production by persistent microorganisms recovered from produced water samples collected from the Marcellus shale formation. Hydrogen sulfide is highly toxic and corrosive, and can lead to the formation of “sour gas” which is costly to refine. Furthermore, microbial colonization of hydraulically fractured shale could result in formation plugging and a reduction in well productivity. It is vital to assess the potential for sulfide production in persistent microbial taxa, especially when considering the trend of reusing produced waters as input fluids, potentially enriching for problematic microorganisms. Using most probable number (MPN) counts and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiple viable strains of bacteria were identified from stored produced waters, mostly belonging to the Genus Halanaerobium, that were capable of growth via fermentation, and produced sulfide when supplied with thiosulfate. No sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were detected through culturing, despite the detection of relatively low numbers of sulfate-reducing lineages by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These results demonstrate that sulfidogenic produced water populations remain viable for years post production and, if left unchecked, have the potential to lead to natural gas souring during shale gas extraction. © Copyright © 2020 Cliffe, Nixon, Daly, Eden, Taylor, Boothman, Wilkins, Wrighton and Lloyd.",biogenic sulfide; Halanaerobium; microbiology; non-conventional gas; thiosulfate-reducing bacteria,hydrogen sulfide; produced water; sulfide; thiosulfate; unclassified drug; water; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium; bacterium identification; controlled study; fuel and fuel related phenomena; gene sequence; Halanaerobium; high throughput sequencing; nonhuman; RNA 16S gene; shale gas,"Cliffe, L.; Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, United Kingdom; эл. почта: Lisa.Cliffe@manchester.ac.uk",,Frontiers Media S.A.,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

Satisfactory data on PM2.5 and CO respectively were obtained for 16 and 17 households using biomass, and 19 and 17 using natural gas. Linear regression analysis indicated that in comparison with kitchens using natural gas, daily average PM2.5 concentrations were substantially higher in kitchens that used biomass in either a chimney stove (mean difference 611, 95% CI: 359, 863 µg/m3) or traditional three-stone stove (mean difference 389, 95% CI: 231, 548 µg/m3). Daily average concentrations of CO were significantly increased when biomass was used in a traditional stove (mean difference from natural gas 3.7, 95% CI: 0.8, 6.7 ppm), but not when it was used in a chimney stove (mean difference −0.8, 95% CI: −4.8, 3.2 ppm).

However, industry supporters of fracking acclaim the benefits of oil and gas drilling, such as energy independence and economic gains. In this study, we examine the perceived impacts of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) on community health and well-being based on interviews with anti-fracking activists in Denton, Texas who were active in the “anti-fracking” community organization, Frack Free Denton (FFD). Emergent from the interviews, we discuss the socio-psychological stressors these community members experienced following the introduction of hydraulic fracturing in the region. Some of the major socio-psychological impacts included perceived physical health risks through anxiety surrounding toxins and carcinogens that may be released through this process. Participants also discussed stress put on community relations, primarily through the form of an “us vs. them” mentality related to the support for, or opposition to, fracking in the community. Moreover, we found anxiety and stress surrounding trust in community members’ relationships with governing bodies, such as the federal government, state government, and local governments.

Future prices of several commodities exhibit a high degree of volatility. However, the task is of paramount importance due to practical implications in industrial sectors. Hence accurate prediction of future closing price becomes essential. This paper presents a novel hybrid granular ensemble of ensembles forecasting framework to estimate future prices of crude oil, natural gas, gold, copper, and silver. The framework incorporates two distinct time series decomposition methodologies, Singular Spectrum Analysis, an eigenvalue driven technique and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition, an extension of orthodox Empirical Mode Decomposition for separately generating granular subseries. Two ensemble machine learning tools-Bagging and Random Forest are then applied to carry out a predictive modeling task on granular components. The ensemble outputs are combined by Extreme Learning Machine, another advanced predictive analytics tool to obtain the final forecasted figures for respective commodities. Statistical comparative analyses show the proposed forecasting framework outperformed five other competitive machine learning models. © 2020 IEEE.",Bagging; Commodity Market; Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition; Extreme Learning Machine; Random Forest; Singular Spectrum Analysis,Commerce; Costs; Crude oil price; Decision trees; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Forecasting; Investments; Machine components; Machine learning; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Comparative analysis; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Extreme learning machine; Global climatic changes; Machine learning models; Singular spectrum analysis; Time series decomposition; Predictive analytics,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781728156880,,,English,"Int.

Proppants are made of silica (quartz sand), alumina, resin-coated silica, ceramics, and others. These materials can be toxic to varying degrees and lead to health problems in the employees handling them primarily due to inhalation exposure. Proppants are selected based on grain size, shape, strength, and cost. Current use is dominated by crystalline silica—the proppant that also has the greatest hazard as an inhalation toxin. Existing research describes the effect of silica on human health, but little research has been done to determine the risk-reduction and social-cost-effectiveness associated with using alternative proppants in light of the health risks. This study quantifies the relative risks or benefits to human health by the use of these proppants through an economic analysis considering the health-related economic impact and its technical attributes. Results show that the use of each ton of silica proppant results in $123 of external costs from fatalities and nonfatal illness arising due to exposure to silica for a crew handing 60,000 tons of proppants. If these health-related externalities were incorporated into the cost, silica proppant could be economically replaced by less harmful, more expensive alternatives for hydraulic fracturing crews handling less than 60,000 tons of proppant each year. © 2019 Society for Risk Analysis",Natural gas; particulate exposure; proppant,Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Cost effectiveness; Economic analysis; Fracture; Health; Health risks; Materials handling; Natural gas; Proppants; Risk assessment; Silica; Toxic materials; Crystalline silica; Functional requirement; Inhalation exposure; Occupational exposure; Oil and natural gas; particulate exposure; proppant; Technical attributes; Economic and social effects; economic analysis; economic impact; hazard assessment; health risk; hydraulic fracturing; natural gas; occupational exposure; public health,"Gernand, J.M.; The Pennsylvania State UniversityUnited States; эл. почта: jmgernand@psu.edu",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,02724332,,RIAND,31858619.0,English,Risk Anal.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076726371

Wastewater management presents significant challenges in the Marcellus shale, where increasing fluid volumes concomitant with expanding development will threaten to overwhelm existing infrastructure over the next decade. In this work, we forecast growth in drilling, flowback, and produced fluid volumes through 2025 based on historic data and consider conventional and alternative disposal options to meet future demands. The results indicate that nearly 12 million m3 (74 MMbbl) of wastewater will be generated annually by 2025. Even assuming wastewater recycling rates in the region rebound, meeting increased demands for wastewater that cannot be reused due to poor quality or logistics would require significant capital investment to expand existing disposal pathways, namely treatment and discharge at centralized facilities or dedicated brine injection in Ohio. Here, we demonstrate the logistical and environmental advantages of an alternative strategy: repurposing depleted oil and gas wells for dedicated injection of wastewater that cannot otherwise be reused or recycled. Hubs of depleted wells could accommodate projected increases in wastewater volumes more efficiently than existing disposal options, primarily because the proximity of depleted wells to active production sites would substantially reduce wastewater transport distances and associated costs. This study highlights the need to reevaluate regional-scale shale wastewater management practices in the context of evolving wastewater qualities and quantities, as strategic planning will result in more socially and economically favorable options while avoiding adverse environmental impacts that have overshadowed the environmental benefits of natural gas expansion in the energy sector. © 2020 The Author(s).

Therefore, it is critical to develop a clearer understanding of the scale and composition of the likely greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with this activity. We compile a detailed inventory of projected upstream oil and gas production expansions as well as recently and soon-to-be built midstream and downstream facilities within the region. Using data from emissions permits, emissions factors, and facility capacities, we estimate expected GHG emissions at the facility level for facilities that have recently been constructed or are soon to be constructed. Our central estimate suggests that the total annual emissions impact of the regional oil and gas infrastructure buildout may reach 541 million tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) by 2030, which is more than 8% of total US GHG emissions in 2017 and roughly equivalent to the emissions of 131 coal-fired power plants. A substantial fraction of the projected emissions come from petrochemical facilities (38%) and liquefied natural gas terminals (19%). Researchers have largely focused on upstream emissions such as fugitive methane (CH4) associated with new US production; our findings reveal the potentially greater prominence of midstream and downstream sources in the studied region. © 2020 The Author(s).

Gas leaks in the laboratory are often difficult to detect and cause serious consequences. In this study, a comprehensive model based on the Bayesian network is established for the assessment of the gas leaks evolution process and consequences in school laboratories. The model can quantitatively evaluate the factors affecting the probability and consequences of gas leakage. The results show that a model is an effective tool for assessing the risk of gas leakage. Among the various factors, the unsafe behavior of personnel has the greatest impact on the probability of gas leakage, and the concentration of toxic and harmful gases is the main factor affecting the consequences of accidents. Since the probability distribution of each node is obtained based on the experience of experts, there is a deviation in the quantitative calculation of the probability of gas leakage and consequences, but does not affect the risk analysis. This study could quantitatively assess the probability and consequences of gas leakage in the laboratory, and identify vulnerabilities, which helps improve the safety management level of gas in the school laboratory and reducing the possibility of gas leakage posing a threat to personal safety. © 2020 by the authors.

During the experiment, we compared the rhythmic activity of levels of total protein and albumin in the rat lymph nodes in ontogenesis and during chronic exposure to sulfur-containing natural gas. The revealed fluctuations of the levels of total protein and albumin can be characterized as around-hourly (ultradian) rhythms, which period is approximately 20-40 to 60 minutes. The obtained experimental data indicate a decrease in the adaptive resistance of lymph node with age and the depletion of the antioxidant system of rats in aging. These results could have a practical value for the development of correction methods of negative effects of toxic oxidative stress in ontogenesis.Использование хронобиологического подхода и биохимических методов исследования позволило комплексно рассмотреть возрастные особенности околочасовых ритмов содержания общего белка, альбумина в ткани лимфатических узлов у крыс в норме и в условиях хронического токсического оксидативного стресса. В ходе эксперимента проведено сравнение ритмической активности содержания общего белка и альбумина в ткани лимфатических узлов у крыс в онтогенезе и при хроническом воздействии серосодержащего природного газа. Выявленные колебания содержания общего белка и альбумина могут быть охарактеризованы как околочасовые (ультрадианные) с периодами от 20–40 до 60 мин. Полученные экспериментальные данные свидетельствуют о снижении адаптивной устойчивости лимфатических узлов с возрастом и об истощении антиоксидантной системы у крыс при старении.

With the development of the economy, socioeconomic factors, such as inequalities in the status of regional economies and the subsequent effects on health systems, have influenced the status of health. We explored the association between age-related cataracts and socioeconomic indicators, including the regional economy, health systems, and energy industries. Methods. This was a prospective, multicenter, Chinese population-based, cross-sectional study. A total of 830 participants from seven centers were enrolled. Data on the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) score, Visual Function Index-14 (VF-14) score, total and subscale scores of the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25), per capita disposable income (PCDI), medical resource-related indicators, and investments in the energy industry were obtained. Associations among these parameters were analyzed. Results. The PCDI ranking was correlated with the VF-14 score (R = −0.426, P < 0.01), total score of NEI-VFQ-25 (r = −0.500, P < 0.01), and BCVA (r = 0.278, P < 0.01). The number of health agencies (r1 = 0.267, r2 = −0.303, r3 = −0.291,), practicing or assistant practicing doctors (r1 = -0.283, r2 = 0.427, r3 = 0.502,), registered nurses (r1 = −0.289, r2 = 0.409, r3 = 0.469, P < 0.01), and health technicians (r1 = −0.278, r2 = 0.426, r3 = 0.500, P < 0.01) per 10,000 of the population was each correlated with the BCVA, VF-14 score, and total score of NEI-VFQ-25, respectively. Health expenditure per capita was correlated with the VF-14 score (r = 0.287, P < 0.01) and total score of NEI-VFQ-25 (r = 0.459, P < 0.01). The LOCS III P score was correlated with investments in the energy industry (r = 0.485, P < 0.001). Conclusions. Patients in higher economic regions with greater medical resources show a greater demand to undergo cataract surgery at a better subjective and objective visual function. The energy industry has a significant effect on cataracts, especially the posterior subcapsular cataract, and thus more attention should be paid to people in regions with abundant energy industries.

Lagos, Nigeria","Nigeria is rated number one producer of crude oil in Africa, and owing to this oil exploration activities have resulted to a high rate of gas flaring, which was intensified by poor enforcement of anti-gas flaring laws by the regulatory authorities. Associated natural gas is generated from oil production, and it is flared in large volumes, thereby leading to the emission of greenhouse gases and a waste of natural resources which could have possibly generated billions of dollars for the Federal Government of Nigeria. There are concerned that if nothing is done to curtail this menace, the environment and man will be at peril due its negative consequences. There is therefore the need to abate gas flaring by replicating the strategies applied in the selected relatively advanced petroleum countries to combat the menace. The study is a comparative analysis of national legal regimes on gas flaring in Nigeria, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia. The study adopts a doctrinal legal research method with point-by-point comparative approach with library-based legal research method. Weak enforcement of laws is largely identified as the key factor responsible for the menace. The study recommends the use of more advanced technologies, a sophisticated mixture of regulations and nonregulatory incentives such as fiscal policies and gas market restructuring.

There are several reserves of natural gas available in Malaysia that contain various other hydrocarbons; however, they are rendered useless due to the high concentration of CO2. There have been studies where CO2 is being utilized in the production of syngas, in which catalysts employed for the synthesis mainly consist of transition metals such as Fe, Ni, Al, Mg, and Mo. In this study, Fe and Ni hydrotalcites catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation method. Al2NO3, MgNO3, and NiNO3 were titrated dropwise against Na2CO3.10H20 while maintaining the temperature and the pH of the solution at 70oC and pH 10, respectively. Similarly, for the iron catalyst, the NiNO3 was replaced with FeNO3 and the remaining chemicals were varied according to the stoichiometric parameters. The catalyst produced was then vacuum-filtered, dried at 80oC and calcined at 650oC. The calcined catalyst was used in the reactor. The gases produced were analyzed using gas chromatography and showed that H2 gas was being produced, finally after the reaction was completed the used catalyst was analyzed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) to prove the growth of carbon nanomaterial. © Malaysian Journal of Microscopy (2020).

The National LPG Master Plan (Master Plan) was developed for scaling up the LPG sector to achieve this target. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate the potential impacts of this planned LPG expansion (the Master Plan) on population health and climate change mitigation, assuming primary, sustained use of LPG for daily cooking. METHODS: We applied existing and developed new mathematical models to calculate the health and climate impacts of expanding LPG primary adoption for household cooking in Cameroon over two periods: a) short-term (2017–2030): Comparing the Master Plan 58% target with a counterfactual LPG adoption of 32% in 2030, in line with current trends; and b) long-term (2031–2100, climate modeling only), assuming Cameroon will become a mature and saturated LPG market by 2100 (73% adoption, based on Latin American countries). We compared this with a counterfactual adoption of 41% by 2100, in line with current trends. RESULTS: By 2030, successful implementation of the Master Plan was estimated to avert about 28,000 (minimum = 22,000, maximum = 35,000) deaths and 770,000 (minimum = 580,000 maximum = 1 million) disability-adjusted life years. For the same period, we estimated reductions in pollutant emissions of more than a third in comparison with the counterfactual, leading to a global cooling of −0:1 milli∘C in 2030. For 2100, a cooling impact from the Master Plan leading to market saturation (73%) was estimated to be −0:70 milli∘C in comparison with to the counterfactual, with a range of −0:64 to −0:93 milli∘C based on different fractions of nonrenewable biomass. DISCUSSION: Successful implementation of the Master Plan could have significant positive impacts on population health in Cameroon with no adverse impacts on climate. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4899. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Surveillance data enable public health and safety professionals to understand the patterns and causes of these incidents, which can improve prevention efforts and preparation for future incidents. Period Covered: 2010-2014. Description of System: In 2010, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) initiated the National Toxic Substance Incidents Program (NTSIP), and it was retired in 2014. Nine state health departments participated in NTSIP surveillance: California, Louisiana, North Carolina, New York, Missouri, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin. The states conducted surveillance on acute toxic substance incidents, defined as an uncontrolled or illegal acute (lasting <72 hours) release of any toxic substance including chemical, biologic, radiologic, and medical materials. Surveillance focused on associated morbidity and mortality and public health actions. This report presents an overview of NTSIP and summarizes incidents and injuries from the nine participating states during 2010-2014. Results: During 2010-2014, participating state health departments reported 22,342 incidents, of which 13,529 (60.6%) met the case definition for acute toxic substance incidents, and included 6,635 injuries among 5,134 injured persons, of whom 190 died. A trend analysis of the three states participating the entire time showed a decrease in the number of incidents with injuries. NTSIP incidents were 1.8 times more likely and injured persons were 10 times more likely to be associated with fixed facilities than transportation. Natural gas, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and chemicals used in illegal methamphetamine production were the most frequent substances in fixed-facility incidents. Sodium and potassium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, natural gas, and sulfuric acid were the most frequent substances in transportation-related incidents. Carbon monoxide was the most frequent substance in incidents with a large number of injured persons, and chemicals used in illegal methamphetamine production were the most frequent substance in incidents involving decontamination. Incidents most frequently occurred during normal business days (Monday through Friday) and hours (6:00 a.m.-5:59 p.m.) and warmer months (March-August). The transportation and warehousing industry sector had the largest number of incidents (4,476); however, most injured persons were injured in their private residences (1,141) or in the industry sectors of manufacturing (668), educational services (606), and real estate rental and leasing (425). The most frequently injured persons were members of the public (43.6%), including students. Injured first responders, particularly police, frequently were not wearing any chemically protective equipment. Respiratory system problems (23.9%) were the most frequently reported symptoms among injured persons and, in a related finding, volatilization was the most frequent type of release in incidents with injured persons. Interpretation: Industrial and transportation incidents occur frequently and have the potential for catastrophic outcomes. However, exposures to toxic substances occur frequently in other settings. Carbon monoxide, natural gas, and chemicals used in illegal methamphetamine production are commonly found in places where persons live, work, attend school, and recreate and are large contributors to incidents affecting the public. Having active NTSIP state surveillance programs did appear to improve the incidents with morbidity and/or mortality, but these programs have ended. Public Health Action Archived NTSIP public use data are available to download from the website for analysis. There are also many publications and reports on the website to help understand chemical risks. In addition, jurisdictions might choose to collect surveillance data themselves in a similar manner to what NTSIP states did. Chemical incident surveillance data can be used by public health and safety practitioners, worker representatives, emergency planners, preparedness coordinators, industries, and emergency responders to prepare for and prevent chemical incidents and injuries. As noted by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, more action needs to be taken to prevent large industrial incidents. Although preventing such incidents might not be in the realm of public health, describing the public health implications and preparing for them is. Another important finding of NTSIP is that industrial incidents are only part of the problem. For example, a large number of persons were injured in a private residence or vehicle (22.2%) and an educational facility (11.8%). Public health professionals must resourcefully target prevention and preparedness to protect vulnerable populations in locations where they might spend time (e.g., schools, daycares, nursing homes, recreational areas, jails, prisons, and hospitals). Reducing the threat of chemical incidents and injuries in the United States will require a concerted effort with a variety of stakeholders including industry and labor, responder groups, policymakers, academia, and citizen advocacy groups. © 2020.",,chemical accident; female; health survey; human; injury; male; occupational accident; United States; Chemical Hazard Release; Female; Humans; Male; Occupational Injuries; Population Surveillance; United States; Wounds and Injuries,"Orr, M.F.; Division of Toxicology and Human Health Sciences, United States; эл. почта: mco0@cdc.gov",,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),15460738,,,32191685.0,English,MMWR Surveill.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful method for directly observing the reconstruction of methane hydrate, yet relevant studies remain limited. In this study, a 9.4-T 400-MHz MRI instrument was employed to investigate CH4 hydrate formation in porous media involving various initial water saturation levels and sand diameters. Pressure histories and MRI signal variations were monitored to discuss the process of CH4 hydrate growth, and the three main formation stages of induction, rapid growth, and slow formation were determined. Furthermore, the liquid water performance in MRI micro-images was analyzed to predict the characteristics of CH4 hydrate formation. The results indicated that CH4 hydrate formed in a spatially and temporally random manner and that pore plugging occurred owing to the residual water encased in grown hydrate. Additionally, phase saturations, water conversion percentages, and formation rates were defined to evaluate the effect of sand diameter and initial water saturation on CH4 hydrate formation. With the reduction in the diameter of quartz glass beads from 400 μm to 100 μm, the average hydrate formation rate increased from 0.0010 min− 1 to 0.0034 min− 1, respectively. When the initial water saturation decreased to the optimized value (0.22 in this study), the water conversion percentage and hydrate saturation increased. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Formation characteristic; Methane hydrate; Phase saturation; Porous medium; Water distribution,methane; silicon dioxide; methane; natural gas; water; analytic method; Article; hydration; image analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygenation; prediction; priority journal; sand; soil analysis; water flow; water metabolism; water saturation; chemistry; equipment design; particle size; porosity; Equipment Design; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Methane; Natural Gas; Particle Size; Porosity; Water,"Zhao, J.; Key Laboratory of Ocean Energy Utilization and Energy Conservation of Ministry of Education, China; эл. почта: jfzhao@dlut.edu.cn",,Elsevier Inc.,0730725X,,MRIMD,31734447.0,English,Magn.

The Netherlands has a well-developed gas infrastructure that primarily transports natural gas, although its constituting features are undergoing major changes. We identify three historical developments, and show how (1) ongoing effects of liberalization; (2) earthquakes in the Groningen-area; and (3) commitment to climate goals affect safety. Between trends of ongoing decentralization and a growing variety of gas producers, the most urgent concerns relate to the operation of low- and medium pressure distribution grids. Natural gas is losing its prominent role, leaving system operators faced with trade-offs induced by a declining share of customers. At the same time, responsibilities for new gas technologies are allocated over a growing number of actors. In illustrating how safety practices have evolved in line with incremental technological and institutional developments over the last half century, this article elaborates how sudden changes in constitutional features of infrastructural systems might jeopardize system safety. © 2019 The Authors",,Economic and social effects; Gas industry; Gas producers; Gases; Natural gas; Gas technologies; Historical development; Institutional change; Institutional development; Safety concerns; Safety practices; Sudden change; System operator; Natural gas wells; natural gas; Article; climate; decentralization; earthquake; gas sector; liberalization; Netherlands; petrochemical industry; politics; priority journal; safety; trend study,"Riemersma, B.; Department of Values, Jaffalaan 5, Netherlands; эл. почта: b.riemersma@tudelft.nl",,Elsevier B.V.,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

We tailor variants of standard equity metrics as well as develop new empirical and analytical methods and metrics to assess spatial, temporal, income, and racial equity as it relates to air quality, climate change, and labor market impacts across the natural gas supply chain. We find moderate to high spatial inequities with respect to the distribution of production (Gini coefficient (η) = 0.93), consumption for electric power generation (η = 0.68), commercial, industrial, and residential end use (η = 0.72), job creation (η = 0.72), and air pollution-related deaths (η = 0.77), which are largely driven by geographically-fixed natural gas abundance and demand. Air quality impacts are also regressive, such that mortality risk induced by natural gas activity generally increases as income decreases; for example, mortality risk (m) (in units of premature mortality per 100 000 people) for the lowest income class (<$15 000; m = 0.22 in 2016) is higher (18%-31%) than for the highest income class (>$150 000; m = 0.27 in 2016). These risks are higher for white (m = 0.30 in 2016) than non-white (m = 0.16 in 2016) populations, which is largely a result of the demographics of rural communities within the vicinity of natural gas development. With respect to local labor market impacts within producing counties, we find marginal declines in income inequality (2.8% ± 1.0%) and poverty rates (9.9% ± 1.7%) during the boom, although household income increases for the wealthiest and decreases for the poorest. At a systems-level, there is an implied air quality-employment tradeoff of 3 (<1 to 7) job-years created per life-year lost; this tradeoff varies spatially (-1100 to 4400 life-years lost minus job-years created), wherein the job benefit outweighs the air quality costs in most producing counties whereas in all other counties the reverse is true. We also observe temporal inequities, with air quality and employment impacts following the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts are largely borne by future generations. Cross-impact elasticities (ϵ), which measure the sensitivity between different types of impacts, reveal that employment increases are sensitive to and coupled with increases in air and climate impacts (ϵ = 1.1 and ϵ = 1.3, respectively). The metrics applied here facilitate the evaluation and design of countervailing policies and systems that explicitly account for social inequities mediated through energy infrastructure, supply, and demand. For example, in future energy system transition, such equity metrics can be used to facilitate decisions related to the siting of low-carbon infrastructure such as transmission lines and wind turbines and the phase-out of fossil fuel infrastructure, as well as to demonstrate changes in distributional tradeoffs such as the decoupling of environmental and employment effects. © 2019 The Author(s).

While the quantity of CH4 leakage from natural gas has been studied extensively, the magnitude and timing of the CH4 mitigation required to meet climate policy goals is less well understood. Here we address this topic by examining the case of US electricity under a range of baseline natural gas leakage rate estimates and emissions equivalency metrics for converting CH4 to CO2-equivalent emissions. We find that CH4 emissions from the power sector would need to be reduced by 30%-90% from today's levels by 2030 in order to meet a CO2-equivalent climate policy target while continuing to rely on natural gas. These CH4 emissions reductions are greater than the required CO2 reductions under the same policy. Alternatively, expanding carbon-free sources more rapidly could meet the 2030 target without reductions in natural gas leakage rates. The results provide insight on an important policy choice in regions and sectors using natural gas, between emphasizing a natural gas supply chain clean-up effort or an accelerated transition toward carbon-free energy sources. © 2019 The Author(s).

While new natural-gas power plants use less water than coal-fired power plants, shale gas extraction through hydraulic fracturing has increased water utilization and intensity. We integrated water and energy use data to quantify the intensity of water use in the US throughout the electricity's lifecycle. We show that in spite of the rise of water use for hydraulic fracturing, during 2013-2016 the overall annual water withdrawal (8.74 × 1010 m3) and consumption (1.75 × 109 m3) for coal were larger than those of natural gas (4.55 × 1010 m3, and 1.07 × 109 m3, respectively). We find that during this period, for every MWh of electricity that has been generated with natural gas instead of coal, there has been a reduction of ∼1 m3 in water consumption and ∼40 m3 in water withdrawal. Examining plant locations spatially, we find that only a small proportion of net electricity generation takes place in water stressed areas, while a large proportion of both coal (37%) and natural gas (50%) are extracted in water stressed areas. We also show that the growing contribution of renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar will reduce water consumption at an even greater magnitude than the transition from coal to natural gas, eliminating much of water withdrawals and consumption for electricity generation in the US. © 2019 The Author(s).

Global fossil CO2 emissions have grown three years consecutively: +1.5% in 2017, +2.1% in 2018, and our slower central projection of +0.6% in 2019 (range of -0.32% to 1.5%) to 37 ± 2 Gt CO2 (Friedlingstein et al 2019 Earth Syst. Sci. Data accepted), after a temporary growth hiatus from 2014 to 2016. Economic indicators and trends in global natural gas and oil use suggest a further rise in emissions in 2020 is likely. CO2 emissions are decreasing slowly in many industrialized regions, including the European Union (preliminary estimate of -1.7% [-3.4% to +0.1%] for 2019, -0.8%/yr for 2003-2018) and United States (-1.7% [-3.7% to +0.3%] in 2019, -0.8%/yr for 2003-2018), while emissions continue growing in India (+1.8% [+0.7% to 3.7%] in 2019, +5.1%/yr for 2003-2018), China (+2.6% [+0.7% to 4.4%] in 2019, +0.4%/yr for 2003-2018), and rest of the world ((+0.5% [-0.8% to 1.8%] in 2019, +1.4%/yr for 2003-2018). Two under-appreciated trends suggest continued long-term growth in both oil and natural gas use is likely. Because per capita oil consumption in the US and Europe remains 5- to 20-fold higher than in China and India, increasing vehicle ownership and air travel in Asia are poised to increase global CO2 emissions from oil over the next decade or more. Liquified natural gas exports from Australia and the United States are surging, lowering natural gas prices in Asia and increasing global access to this fossil resource. To counterbalance increasing emissions, we need accelerated energy efficiency improvements and reduced consumption, rapid deployment of electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage technologies, and a decarbonized electricity grid, with new renewable capacities replacing fossil fuels, not supplementing them. Stronger global commitments and carbon pricing would help implement such policies at scale and in time. © 2019 The Author(s).

The power generation of Bangladesh highly depends on fossil fuels like natural gas, oil, and coal. But, these fossil fuels are highly responsible for greenhouse gas emissions (GGE). Carbon Capture Process (CCP) technologies are expected to play an effective role in the upcoming decades for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plant is one of the energy generation technologies having the significant potential to capture carbon di-oxides (CO2) with low penalties. The main contribution of this research is to find a suitable technology to reduce the massive emission of CO2 as well as generating electricity which will be helpful to support the features of Industry 4.0 or sustainable technology. Therefore, this paper focuses on the investigation of the feasibility of IGCC power plant with CCP technology in perspective of Bangladesh by comparing it with a conventional Pulverized Coal-Fired power plant based on their performances in terms of capital cost, operating cost, CO2 emission factor, and net efficiency. In terms of CO2 emission and net efficiency, the IGCC power plant with CCP technology is a better choice in the long run. The proposed IGCC with CCP outperforms the coal-fired power plant with a net efficiency of 11.55% and almost no emission of CO2. © 2019 IEEE.",Bangladesh; CCP; CO2 Emission; Conventional Pulverized Coal-Fired power plant; Economic analysis; IGCC; Power generation,Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Combined cycle power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industry 4.0; Natural gasoline plants; Pulverized fuel; Carbon capture process; Coal-fired power plant; Energy generations; Feasibility studies; Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle power plants; National economy; Pulverized coal fired power plant; Sustainable technology; Fossil fuel power plants,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781728160979,,,English,"Int.

Hence, both children and adults in Kerman are potentially exposed to a high carcinogenic risk via ingestion and dermal contact. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",health risk assessment; incremental lifetime cancer risk; PAHs; street dust; urban pollution,chrysene; fluoranthene; fossil fuel; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; carcinogen; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; adult; cancer; carcinogen; detection method; dust; health risk; metropolitan area; natural gas; PAH; pollution exposure; risk assessment; source apportionment; urban area; urban pollution; Article; body weight; cancer risk; combustion; dust; environmental exposure; health hazard; human; inhalation; Iran; lifespan; mass fragmentography; molecular weight; pollution; risk assessment; urban area; adult; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; child; dust; toxicity; urban health; Iran; Kerman [Iran]; United States; Adult; Air Pollutants; Carcinogens; Child; Dust; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Iran; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Risk Assessment; Urban Health,"Keshavarzi, B.; Department of Earth Sciences, Post Box: 71454, Iran; эл. почта: Bkeshavarzi@shirazu.ac.ir",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,09603123,,IJERE,30714393.0,English,Int.

However, methanotrophs, bacteria capable of utilising methane as the sole source of carbon and energy, play a significant role in reducing the emissions of methane from many environments. Methylocella-like facultative methanotrophs are a unique group of bacteria that grow on other components of natural gas (i.e. ethane and propane) in addition to methane but a little is known about the distribution and activity of Methylocella in the environment. The purposes of this study were to identify bacteria involved in cycling methane emitted from natural gas seeps and, most importantly, to investigate if Methylocella-like facultative methanotrophs were active utilisers of natural gas at seep sites. Results: The community structure of active methane-consuming bacteria in samples from natural gas seeps from Andreiasu Everlasting Fire (Romania) and Pipe Creek (NY, USA) was investigated by DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) using 13C-labelled methane. The 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from DNA-SIP experiments revealed that of various active methanotrophs, Methylocella was the only active methanotrophic genus common to both natural gas seep environments. We also isolated novel facultative methanotrophs, Methylocella sp. PC1 and PC4 from Pipe Creek, able to utilise methane, ethane, propane and various non-gaseous multicarbon compounds. Functional and comparative genomics of these new isolates revealed genomic and physiological divergence from already known methanotrophs, in particular, the absence of mxa genes encoding calcium-containing methanol dehydrogenase. Methylocella sp. PC1 and PC4 had only the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (XoxF). These are the first Alphaproteobacteria methanotrophs discovered with this reduced functional redundancy for C-1 metabolism (i.e. sMMO only and XoxF only). Conclusions: Here, we provide evidence, using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, that Methylocella are abundant and active at terrestrial natural gas seeps, suggesting that they play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of these gaseous alkanes. This might also be significant for the design of biotechnological strategies for controlling natural gas emissions, which are increasing globally due to unconventional exploitation of oil and gas. © 2019 The Author(s).",Biological methane; DNA stable isotope probing; Facultative methanotrophs; Geological methane; Methylocella; Natural gas; Propanotrophs; Soluble methane monooxygenase; XoxF-methanol dehydrogenase,methane; methane monooxygenase; methanol dehydrogenase; natural gas; stable isotope; carbon; methane; natural gas; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium contamination; bacterium culture; bacterium isolate; carbon cycling; community structure; density gradient centrifugation; DNA DNA hybridization; DNA extraction; gene sequence; methanotrophic bacterium; Methylocella; microbial community; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; Beijerinckiaceae; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; phylogeny; Romania; United States; Beijerinckiaceae; Carbon; Methane; Natural Gas; Phylogeny; Romania; Soil Microbiology; United States,"Farhan Ul Haque, M.; School of Environmental Sciences, United Kingdom; эл. почта: M.Farhan@uea.ac.uk",,BioMed Central Ltd.,20492618,,,31585550.0,English,Microbiome,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072930844

Compound and cascading hazards are becoming increasingly important and have notable impacts on threatened communities across the world. Wildfire followed by an intense precipitation event can result in a large flood under which the combined impacts of hazard drivers are much more intense than those from individual drivers. Here, we first quantify the change in exposure of natural gas infrastructure to individual hazards, wildfire and floods in the future relative to past. We, then quantify the compound hazards as coincidence likelihood of intense rain over burned areas and analyze the spatial patterns across the State of California, USA.

More and more car manufacturers are following suit in moving from prototyping to commercial demonstrations of fuel cell electric cars. Natural gas and coal are currently the cheapest sources of hydrogen and are likely to remain so. In the present study, magnesium waste-based materials from end of life products were used as raw materials in the presence of iron chloride added water solution to generate hydrogen gas. Magnesium (Mg) reacts slowly with water and releases hydrogen at room temperature and this is followed by the formation of magnesium hydroxide on its surface. This reaction was accelerated by an addition of 1.5 wt% of iron chloride. The results confirmed iron chloride as an excellent hydrolysis reaction accelerator with stainless steel as an effective catalyst.

In this work, we investigate the decoupling states and driving factors of decoupling states in the transport sector of China’s four municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing) through combining the Tapio decoupling approach with the decomposition technique. The results show that (i) the decoupling state of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin improved; Beijing stabilized in weak decoupling; Shanghai and Tianjin appeared to have strong decoupling, but the decoupling state of Chongqing deteriorated from decoupling to negative decoupling. (ii) The energy-saving effect was the primary contributor to decoupling in these four municipalities, promoting transport’s economic growth strongly decouple from carbon emission. The economic scale effect was not optimized enough in Chongqing, facilitating expansive coupling, and expansive negative decoupling emerged. But it had a rather positive impact on decoupling process in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, promoting economic growth to weakly decouple from carbon emission. (iii) The carbon-reduction effect promoted strong decoupling, which emerged in Shanghai’s transport sector, more so than in the other three municipalities, in which weak decoupling emerged. Finally, several relevant policy recommendations were offered to promote the decoupling of carbon emission from economic growth and low-carbon transport. © 2019 by the authors.

Ethoxylated alcohol surfactants, which include alkyl ethoxylates (AEOs) and polyethylene glycols (PEGs), are often present in HFF as solvents, non-emulsifiers, and corrosion inhibitors. We present detailed analysis of polyethoxylates in HFF at the time of injection into three hydraulically fractured Marcellus Shale wells and in the produced water returning to the surface. Despite the addition of AEOs to the injection fluid during almost all stages, they were rarely detected in the produced water. Conversely, while PEGs were nearly absent in the injection fluid, they were the dominant constituents in the produced water. Similar numbers of ethoxylate units support downhole transformation of AEOs to PEGs through central cleavage of the ethoxylate chain from the alkyl group. We also observed a decrease in the average ethoxylate (EO) number of the PEG-EOs in the produced water over time, consistent with biodegradation during production. Our results elucidate an overlooked surfactant transformation pathway that may affect the efficacy of HFF to maximize oil and gas recovery from unconventional shale reservoirs. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Biodegradation; Corrosion; Environmental impact; Fracturing fluids; Hydraulic fracturing; Polyethylene glycols; Produced Water; Shale; Surface active agents; Alkyl ethoxylates; Ethoxylated alcohols; Hydrocarbon recovery; Marcellus shales; Situ transformation; Transformation pathways; Unconventional oil and gas; Unconventional reservoirs; Injection (oil wells); alkyl group; ethoxylate; hydrocarbon; macrogol derivative; polyethoxylate derivative; surfactant; unclassified drug; water; macrogol; mineral; natural gas; surfactant; water; Article; biodegradation; biotransformation; chemical analysis; fracking; hydraulic conductivity; hydraulic fracturing fluid; priority journal; surface area; water quality; bioremediation; chemistry; oil and gas field; waste water; Biodegradation, Environmental; Hydraulic Fracking; Minerals; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Polyethylene Glycols; Surface-Active Agents; Waste Water; Water; Water Quality","McAdams, B.C.; National Energy Technology Laboratory, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, United States; эл. почта: Brandon.McAdams@netl.doe.gov",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,31588952.0,English,Environ.

The human-ecological health risks and challenges associated with the disposal of produced water may be alleviated by understanding geochemical controls on processes responsible for the solubilization of potentially hazardous natural shale constituents to produced water. Here, we investigated, through a series of batch treatments, the leaching behavior of As, Se, Cu, Fe, Ba, Cr, Cd, and radioactive nuclides U, Ra from shale to produced water. Specifically, the effect of four major controls on element mobility was studied: (1) solution pH, (2) ionic strength of the solution, (3) oxic-anoxic conditions, and (4) an additive used in fracking fluid. The mobilization of metals and metalloids from shale was greatest in treatments containing sodium persulfate, an oxidant and a commonly used additive in fracture fluid. In the high ionic strength treatments, dissolved Ba concentrations increased 5-fold compared to low ionic strength treatments. Overall, anoxic conditions superimposed with low pH resulted in the largest increase of dissolved metals and radionuclides such as Ra. Overall, our results suggest that (1) limiting pore water acidification by injection of alkaline fluid in carbonate-low shale and (2) minimizing strong oxidizing conditions in shale formations may result in cost-effective in situ retention of produced water contaminants. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Additives; Alkalinity; Cost effectiveness; Geochemistry; Health risks; Hydraulic fracturing; Ionic strength; Produced Water; Radioisotopes; Sodium compounds; Toxic materials; Trace elements; Water pollution; Geochemical conditions; Geochemical control; Injection of alkaline fluids; Metals and metalloids; Naturally occurring radioactive materials; Oxidizing conditions; Shale-fluid interactions; Unconventional oil and gas; Shale; arsenic; barium ion; cadmium; chromium; cuprous ion; iron; radioisotope; selenium; sodium; trace element; arsenic; barium; cadmium; chromium; copper; iron; natural gas; oxygen; radioisotope; radium; selenium; trace element; uranium; Article; autoradiography; concentration (parameter); fracking; geochemical analysis; ionic strength; leaching; pH; priority journal; radioactivity; chemistry; fracking; osmolarity; Arsenic; Barium; Cadmium; Chromium; Copper; Hydraulic Fracking; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Iron; Natural Gas; Osmolar Concentration; Oxygen; Radioisotopes; Radium; Selenium; Trace Elements; Uranium,"Kocar, B.D.; Civil and Environmental Engineering, 15 Vassar St, United States; эл. почта: bkocar@exponent.com",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,31553335.0,English,Environ.

Gender factors is an important perspective to examine the path of carbon emissions. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2016, this paper selects the optimal spatial measurement model structure by using the Bayesian posterior probability model structure selection method, and studies the impact of economy on carbon emissions and the influence mechanism of gender-based “synergy effect” on carbon emissions from the National level and regional levels. The research shows that the increase of economic promotes the increase of carbon emission in this region, but it has a restraining effect on the carbon emission in the surrounding areas. Moreover, gender factors have a significant positive effect on the region at the National level and the Eastern and Northeastern regions, but not significantly in other ones, and have a significant negative impact on carbon emissions in surrounding areas. Overall, the influence intensity of economy on carbon emission increases with the increase of gender in the National level and the Eastern and Northeastern, while the influence intensity of economy of peripheral regions on carbon emission in Central Region decreases with the increase of gender factors in peripheral regions. © 2019 by the authors.

Methods: Audiograms of 1.9 million workers across all industries (including 9389 in Mining and 1076 in OGE) from 2006 to 2015 were examined. Prevalence and adjusted risk as compared to a reference industry (Couriers and Messengers) were estimated for all industries combined and the Mining and OGE sectors and subsectors. Results: The prevalences of HL in Mining and OGE were 24% and 14%, respectively, compared with 16% for all industries combined. Many Mining and one OGE subsector exceeded these prevalences and most had an adjusted risk (prevalence ratio) significantly greater than the reference industry. Some subsectors, particularly in OGE, could not be examined due to low sample size. The prevalences in Construction Sand and Gravel Mining and Natural Gas Liquid Extraction were 36% and 28%, respectively. Workers within Support Activities for Coal Mining had double the risk of HL than workers in the reference industry. Conclusions: The many subsectors identified with high prevalences and/or worker risks for HL well above risks in the reference industry need critical attention to conserve worker hearing and maintain worker quality of life.

However, the trade-off among mechanical stability, adsorption capacity, and diffusion kinetics remains an elusive challenge for the practical application of 3D-printed zeolites. Herein, a facile “3D printing and zeolite soldering” strategy is developed to construct mechanically robust binder-free zeolite monoliths (ZM-BF) with hierarchical structures, which can act as a superior configuration for CO2 capture. Halloysite nanotubes are employed as printing ink additives, which serve as both reinforcing materials and precursor materials for integrating ZM-BF by ultrastrong interfacial “zeolite-bonds” subjected to hydrothermal treatment. ZM-BF exhibits outstanding mechanical properties with robust compressive strength up to 5.24 MPa, higher than most of the reported structured zeolites with binders. The equilibrium CO2 uptake of ZM-BF reaches up to 5.58 mmol g−1 (298 K, 1 bar), which is the highest among all reported 3D-printed CO2 adsorbents. Strikingly, the dynamic adsorption breakthrough tests demonstrate the superiority of ZM-BF over commercial benchmark zeolites for flue gas purification and natural gas and biogas upgrading. This work introduces a facile strategy for designing and fabricating high-performance hierarchically structured zeolite adsorbents and even catalysts for practical applications. © 2019 The Authors.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was employed to visually analyze the spatial and temporal formation behavior of methane hydrate in a porous media. Detailed information about the water distribution, initial nucleation sites, and hydrate growth was obtained, in addition to MRI images. The results demonstrated that the water molecules distributed in the vertical direction preferred the middle slice of a porous medium sample, and the decrease in the number of molecules in the middle slice and on both sides of the slice was similar during hydrate formation. The formation process are quite different in selected horizontal slices, which were contributed to the various distribution of water and gas in pore spaces and the randomness of methane hydrate formation. The extension of these predicted results could have important implications for optimizing the formation processes of gas hydrate in hydrate-based technologies. © 2019",Blockage; Formation behavior; Magnetic resonance imaging; Migration path; Natural gas hydrate,methane hydrate; natural gas; unclassified drug; water; carbon; Carbon-13; methane; proton; Article; gas; partial pressure; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; qualitative analysis; artifact; chemistry; equipment design; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; porosity; X ray diffraction; Artifacts; Carbon Isotopes; Equipment Design; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Methane; Porosity; Protons; Water; X-Ray Diffraction,"Zhao, J.; Key Laboratory of Ocean Energy Utilization and Energy Conservation of Ministry of Education, China; эл. почта: jfzhao@dlut.edu.cn",,Elsevier Inc.,0730725X,,MRIMD,31170430.0,English,Magn.

Hydraulic fracturing can release contaminants, including trace metals, many of which are known developmental toxicants. To date, there is limited data on human exposure to contaminants in this region. Objective: We aimed to examine trace metals in urine and hair samples from 29 Indigenous and non-Indigenous pregnant women from two communities (Chetwynd and Dawson Creek) in Northeastern British Columbia. Methods: We recruited 29 pregnant women who provided spot urine samples over five consecutive days and one hair sample. We measured 19 trace metals in pooled urine samples from each participant and in the first 2 cm of hair closest to the scalp. We compared urinary and hair concentrations to those measured in women from the general population using data from the Canadian Health Measure Survey (CHMS), or reference values found in the literature for trace metals not measured in the CHMS. Results: Median urinary (0.49 μg/L) and hair (0.16 μg/g) concentrations of manganese were higher in our participants than in the CHMS (<0.05 µg/L in urine) or reference population (0.067 μg/g in hair). In hair, median values for barium (4.48 μg/g), aluminum (4.37 μg/g) and strontium (4.47 μg/g) were respectively 16, 3, and 6 times higher compared with median values in a reference population. Concentrations of barium and strontium in hair were higher in self-identified Indigenous participants (5.9 and 5.46 μg/g, respectively) compared to non-Indigenous participants (3.88 and 2.60 μg/g) (p-values = 0.02 and 0.03). Conclusion: Our results suggest higher gestational exposure to certain trace metals in our study population compared to reference populations. © 2019, Springer Nature America, Inc.",Biomonitoring; Gestational exposure; Hydraulic fracturing; Trace metals,metal; trace element; British Columbia; chemistry; environmental monitoring; female; fracking; hair; health survey; human; pilot study; pregnancy; procedures; reference value; urine; British Columbia; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Hair; Health Surveys; Humans; Hydraulic Fracking; Metals; Pilot Projects; Pregnancy; Reference Values; Trace Elements,"Caron-Beaudoin, É.; Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, 2375 chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, Canada; эл. почта: elyse.caron-beaudoin@umontreal.ca",,Nature Publishing Group,15590631,,,31089244.0,English,J.

Some chlorinated PAHs (ClPAHs) are more toxic than their corresponding parent PAHs and can also be generated in food during cooking. Knowledge of the concentrations of ClPAHs in cooked foods has been limited by the lack of an adequate analytical method for measuring ClPAH concentrations in cooked foods. In this study, we developed an analytical method for simultaneous determination of PAHs and ClPAHs in lipid-rich foods. The combination of a potassium hydroxide silica gel column and an activated carbon cartridge enabled us to simultaneously measure PAH and ClPAH concentrations in raw and grilled fish and meats. Twelve kinds of PAHs (e.g., fluorene [Fle], phenanthrene [Phe], fluoranthene [Flu], and pyrene [Pyr]) were detected in grilled foods. The concentrations ranged from below the limit of quantitation (&lt;LOQ) to 310 ng g −1 . We also detected 9-monochlorinated Phe (9-ClPhe), 3-monochlorinated Flu (3-ClFlu), 8-monochlorinated Flu (8-ClFlu), and 1-monochlorinated Pyr (1-ClPyr); those concentrations ranged from &lt;LOQ to 0.16 ng g −1 . The total concentrations of PAHs were significantly lower in gas-grilled meats than in charcoal-grilled meats. In contrast, the concentrations of ClPAHs were significantly higher in gas-grilled meats than in the charcoal-grilled meats. This pattern could be attributed to the difference of reaction temperatures needed to generate them. Toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations, which were calculated based on toxicities relative to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), were much higher in the grilled foods (0.12–12 ng-BaP eq g −1 ) for PAHs than for ClPAHs (&lt;LOQ to 0.026 ng-BaP eq g −1 ). © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Analytical method; Chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Food; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Unintentional generation,"1 monochlorinated pyrene; 1,9 dichlorophenantherene; 2 chloroanthracene; 3 monochlorinated fluoranthene; 3,9 dichlorophenantherene; 8 monochlorinated fluoranthene; 9 chloroanthracene; 9 chlorofluorene fluorene; 9 chlorophenanthrene; 9 monochlorinated phenanthrene; 9,10 dichlorophenanthrene; 9.10 dichloroanthracene; activated carbon; anthracene; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[ghi]perylene; benz[a]anthracene; chlorine derivative; chrysene; dibenz[a,h]anthracene; fluoranthene; fluorene; indeno[1,2,3 cd]pyrene; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; potassium hydroxide; pyrene; silica gel; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; charcoal; chlorinated hydrocarbon; natural gas; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; analytical method; concentration (composition); dietary intake; food; PAH; pollution exposure; animal tissue; Article; fish meat; food; food analysis; grilled food; limit of quantitation; nonhuman; reaction temperature; toxic concentration; toxin analysis; analysis; animal; cooking; meat; sea food; Animals; Charcoal; Cooking; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Meat; Natural Gas; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Seafood","Miyake, Y.; University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Suruga-ku, Japan; эл. почта: y-miyake@u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp",,Academic Press,01476513,,EESAD,31009924.0,English,Ecotoxicol.

Pleasant St., Amherst, MA  01002, United States","Fossil fuel combustion releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere along with co-pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and others. These emissions result in environmental externalities primarily in terms of climate and air quality. Here we quantify the cost of co-pollutant emissions per ton of CO2 emissions from US electric power generation. We measure the co-pollutant cost of carbon (CPCC) as the total value of statistical life associated with US-based premature mortalities attributable to co-pollutant emissions, per mass of CO2. We find an average CPCC of ∼$45 per metric ton (mt) of CO2 for the year 2011 (in 2017 USD). This is ∼20% higher than the central Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) measure of climate damages that was used by the Obama administration in its regulatory impact analysis for the Clean Power Plan (CPP), and &gt;8 times higher than the SCC used by the Trump administration in its analysis for the Plan's repeal. At the state-level, the CPCC ranged from ∼$7/mt CO2 for Arizona to ∼$96/mt CO2 for New Jersey. We calculate the CPCC trends from 2002 to 2017 and find a 71% decrease at the national level, contributing to total savings of ∼$1 trillion in averted mortality from power plant emissions over this period. By decomposing the aggregate and fuel-specific co-pollutant intensities into simultaneous (CO2-driven) and autonomous components, we conclude that the CPCC trends originated mainly from targeted efforts to reduce co-pollutant emissions, e.g. through fuel switching (from coal to natural gas) and autonomous changes in co-pollutant emissions. The results suggest that the overall benefit to society from policies to curtail carbon emissions may be enhanced by focusing on pollution sources where the associated air-quality co-benefits are greatest. At the same time, continued efforts to reduce co-pollutant intensities, if technologically feasible, could help to mitigate the air-quality damages of the CPP's repeal and replacement. © 2019 The Author(s).

This study analyzes the supply-side drivers of the increasing trend up until 2005 as well as the factors across US states that enabled significant reductions in the following decade. Using index decomposition analysis, we show that the two main factors driving the CO2 decrease were natural gas substituting for coal and petroleum, and large increases in renewable energy generation (primarily wind) - which were responsible for 60% and 30% of the decline respectively since 2005. Both effects were concentrated in states where low natural gas prices or a combination of federal tax credits, state energy policies, decreasing costs of renewables, and advantageous wind conditions drove significant reductions of CO2 emissions - resulting in the overall national emissions decline. © 2019 The Author(s).

We study consumer preferences for combustion fuels including gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) using consumer choice survey data from two settings: online (n = 331) and in-person at refueling stations (n = 127). Light-duty vehicle owners were asked in a series of choice tasks to choose among fuels that varied in type, price, CO2 emissions, and location of origin for a hypothetical vehicle that could accept all fuels. We find that the majority of gasoline and E85 users are willing to substitute towards other fuels at today's prices and attributes, while diesel users have a strong preference for diesel fuel. We also find that respondents are willing to pay on average $150/ton CO2 avoided from fuel consumption - more than most estimates of the social cost of carbon. Thus, communicating the climate benefits from alternative fuels may be an important strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector. © 2019 The Author(s).

The prediction of an acceptable temperature profile requires a series of complex and iterative calculations which the available data in most of the cases is insufficient. In order to develop a temperature profile correlation of the gas pipelines in Amazonas was performed the calculation of the overall heat transfer coefficient by thermohydraulic simulations from real values. In this study, pressure, flow, and temperature data were collected from the natural gas field and were inserted into Pipeline Studio ® Software. The best overall heat transfer coefficients performance in relation to real temperature profile were 2.0 W/m2K, 1.7 W/m2K, and 1 W/m2K. These results were used because the graph of the temperature profile has behaved in a way more compatible with the graph of the real temperature profile. Therefore, a comparison of real data with simulation results shows good agreement and the best value to be used on thermohydraulic simulation for transport pipelines in Amazonas is 1.0 W/m2K. © 2019 IEEE.",,Flow of gases; Gas industry; Heat transfer coefficients; Heat transfer performance; Iterative methods; Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Studios; Temperature control; Installation position; Iterative calculation; Natural gas transport; Overall heat transfer coefficient; Real-temperature; Temperature data; Temperature profiles; Thermo-hydraulic simulations; Pipelines,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781728121741,,,English,"Int.

Biomass energy can be tapped throughout the year through agricultural waste, human and animal waste. The better utilization of biomass would be the best alternative to the fast depleted fossil fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas. Electricity through biomass gasifier emits less CO2 compared to the coal based electricity plants. The methane is generated from bio waste through land fill method and the methane gas is utilized like Liquefied Petroleum Gas.

Design: Comparative cross-sectional study. Setting: Rural villages in Sindh, Pakistan. Participants: Women aged ≥40 years who had used biomass fuel for cooking for at least the last year (n=436), and a comparison group (n=414) who had cooked only with non-biomass fuel during the last year were recruited through door-to-door visits. None of those who were invited to take part declined. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Hypertension was determined from blood pressure measurements and use of medication. CHD was assessed by three measures: history of angina (Rose angina questionnaire), previous history of 'heart attack', and definite or probable changes of CHD on ECG. Potentially confounding risk factors were ascertained by questionnaire and anthropometry. Associations of hypertension and CHD with use of biomass and other risk factors were assessed by logistic regression, and summarised by ORs with 95% CIs. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no association of hypertension (OR: 1.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.4) angina (OR: 1.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.4), heart attack (OR: 1.2, 95% 0.7 to 2.2) or ECG changes of CHD (OR: 0.8, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.2) with current use of biomass for cooking. Nor were any associations apparent when analyses were restricted to long-term (≥10 years) users and non-users of biomass fuel. Conclusions: A linked air monitoring study indicated substantially higher airborne concentrations of fine particulate matter in kitchens where biomass was used for cooking. It is possible that associations with CHD and hypertension were missed because most of the comparison group had used biomass for cooking at some time in the past, and risk remains elevated for many years after last exposure. © 2019 Author(s).",biomass fuel; coronary heart disease; epidemiology; hypertension; public health; women,"antihypertensive agent; fuel; kerosene; liquefied petroleum gas; natural gas; adult; angina pectoris; anthropometry; antihypertensive therapy; Article; biomass; blood pressure measurement; cardiovascular risk; comparative study; controlled study; cooking; cross-sectional study; disease association; electrocardiography; female; health care survey; heart infarction; household income; human; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; medical history; middle aged; Pakistan; adverse event; aged; cooking; coronary artery disease; hypertension; indoor air pollution; risk factor; rural population; smoke; Adult; Aged; Air Pollution, Indoor; Biomass; Cooking; Coronary Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Middle Aged; Pakistan; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Smoke","Fatmi, Z.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Pakistan; эл. почта: zafar.fatmi@aku.edu",,BMJ Publishing Group,20446055,,,31399463.0,English,BMJ Open,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070442102

Least-cost emission and technology trajectories are generated using an optimization-based stock-and-flow model of electricity generation to meet the 70% target. The analysis finds that the 30%-44% reduction in emissions projected under a least cost business-as-usual (BAU) scenario dominated by natural gas would fall well short of the 70% reduction target at 2050. Delaying reductions in BAU emissions beyond 2030 would require deployment of DAC to achieve the 70% target. Further delays to reduce BAU emissions until 2035 would require up to 1.4 Gt CO2 of DAC capacity to achieve the 70% target. Delaying reductions in BAU emissions beyond 2035 would require so much DAC deployment as to be implausible, placing the 70% target out of reach for most scenarios. Each year of delay in reducing CO2 emissions beyond BAU after 2020 increases costs to achieve the 70% target. A DAC-based emissions reduction future could cost an additional 580-2015 billion USD through 2050 compared to emissions mitigation starting immediately. This translates to approximately 100-345 million USD per day of delay starting in 2020. These costs arise not just from building DAC plants, but from replacing relatively young fossil fuel plants being built today with renewables as well as for the electric power needed for DAC. These results make clear that minimizing the costs of DAC deployment depend on reducing BAU emissions as early as possible, and if done quickly enough, DAC can be avoided altogether - which reduces costs the most. Hence there should be no delay in aggressively reducing emissions from the US electric sector. © 2019 The Author(s).

Tight sandstone gas is an important class of unconventional natural gas reservoirs that exist in many basins around the world and have large reserves. With the progress of science and technology, the degree of oil and gas exploration and development has been continuously improved. People are gradually aware of the huge economic value of tight sandstone reservoirs, but this also makes it more and more difficult to explore oil and gas. Therefore, it is important to fully understand the basic characteristics of tight sandstone reservoirs and their physical influencing factors to identify the genesis of relevant tight sandstone reservoirs and the diagenetic evolution during geological history. By means of microscopic study and quantitative statistics of various thin sections under microscope, combined with experimental analysis and testing methods such as scanning electron microscopy, thin section and inclusion incineration observation, cathodoluminescence, inclusion homogenization temperature and laser Raman probe composition analysis, the tight sandstone of reservoir was studied in combination with the diagenetic evolution of different lithologies. The basic difference between compact reservoir and conventional reservoir is recognized through research, and the compact reservoir is unconventional reservoir, but it has both unconventional and conventional attributes. By studying the control and influence of deposits, diagenesis and fractures on pore throat characteristics and physical properties of tight reservoirs, evaluation parameters are screened from reservoir performance, flow ability, control factors and result verification, and comprehensive evaluation criteria for tight reservoirs are established, which provides a basis for the identification of high-quality reservoirs. © 2019, Interamerican Society for Electron Microscopy (CIASEM).

However, the utility of the increasing spatial resolution of disease mapping and environmental exposures is limited by the lack of receptor population data at similar sub-census block spatial scales. Methods: Here we apply an innovative method (Population Allocation by Occupied Domicile Estimation - ABODE) to disaggregate U.S. Census populations by allocating an average person per household to geospatially-identified residential housing units (RHU). We considered two possible sources of RHU location data: address point locations and building footprint centroids. We compared the performance of ABODE with the common proportional population allocation (PPA) method for estimating the nighttime residential populations within 200 m radii and setback areas (100 - 300 ft) around active underground natural gas storage (UGS) wells (n = 9834) in six U.S. states. Results: Address location data generally outperformed building footprint data in predicting total counts of census residential housing units, with correlations ranging from 0.67 to 0.81 at the census block level. Using residentially-sited addresses only, ABODE estimated upwards of 20,000 physical households with between 48,126 and 53,250 people living within 200 m of active UGS wells - likely encompassing the size of a proposed UGS Wellhead Safety Zone. Across the 9834 active wells assessed, ABODE estimated between 5074 and 10,198 more people living in these areas compare to PPA, and the difference was significant at the individual well level (p = &lt; 0.0001). By either population estimation method, OH exhibits a substantial degree of hyperlocal land use conflict between populations and UGS wells - more so than other states assessed. In some rare cases, population estimates differed by more than 100 people for the small 200 m2 well-areas. ABODE's explicit accounting of physical households confirmed over 50% of PPA predictions as false positives indicated by non-zero predictions in areas absent physical RHUs. Conclusions: Compared to PPA - in allocating identical population data at sub-census block spatial scales -ABODE provides a more precise population at risk (PAR) estimate with higher confidence estimates of populations at greatest risk. 65% of UGS wells occupy residential urban and suburban areas indicating the unique land use conflicts presented by UGS systems that likely continue to experience population encroachment. Overall, ABODE confirms tens of thousands of homes and residents are likely located within the proposed UGS Wellhead Safety Zone - and in some cases within state's oil and gas well surface setback distances - of active UGS wells. © 2019 The Author(s).",Environmental health; Oil and gas; Population at risk; Safety; Setbacks; U.S. Census; Underground natural gas storage,natural gas; oil; census; estimation method; gas storage; health impact; health status; mapping method; natural gas; occupational exposure; resource allocation; risk factor; safety; spatial resolution; underground construction; well technology; Article; California; false positive result; household; human; land use; Michigan; New York; Ohio; Pennsylvania; population; prediction; priority journal; risk; West Virginia; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; housing; oil and gas field; procedures; United States; United States; Rhus; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Housing; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; United States,"Michanowicz, D.R.; Center for Climate, 401 Park Drive, United States; эл. почта: michanow@hsph.harvard.edu",,BioMed Central Ltd.,1476069X,,,31280723.0,English,Environ.

Our results indicate that more intense and prolonged warm conditions will drive an increase in electricity demand while a shorter and milder cold season will reduce natural gas demand by the mid 21st century. The environmental conditions that favor more cooling degree days in summer and reduced heating degree days in winter are driven by changes in daily maximum temperatures and daily minimum temperatures in the respective seasons.

Fluoride is ubiquitous in nature and an excessive intake of fluoride via the drinking water results in significant health effects, particularly with exposure in utero and in early childhood. Most of the conventional methods for the removal of fluoride from drinking water in water treatment plants require high initial capital and ongoing maintenance costs. The aim of the present study was to investigate the freezing and melting process as an innovative, convenient, and low-cost technology to produce healthy drinking water for people living in areas with high drinking water fluoride concentrations. We found that the freezing and melting process had a proximate fluoride removal performance of 60% when the freezing of water with a high concentration of fluoride proceeded until 10–15% of the initial water volume was frozen. Nevertheless, in order to achieve drinking water with less than 1.5 mg/L of fluoride, from water with a high initial fluoride content, one or two re-freezing steps of the melted ice were required. In the end, it was proven that this method is able to produce enough healthy drinking water for children for households. This process could be used as a cost-effective large scale technology in the community or as a small scale method at home with a minimal capital expenditure and no need for advanced knowledge requirements. With application of liquid natural gas (LNG), solar energy, and wind power as clean and cheap energy sources, it will be possible to build large scale freezing systems for the removal of fluoride from drinking water for communities. © 2019, ISFR.",Crystallization; Drinking water; Fluoride; Freezing process,,"Mahvi, A.H.; Center for Solid Waste Research, Iran; эл. почта: ahmahvi@yahoo.com",,International Society for Fluoride Research,00154725,,FLUOA,,English,Fluoride,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091530695

Genetic algorithms (GAs), inspired by the process of natural selection, are well suited for phase optimization in wavefront shaping problems. In 2012, Conkey et al. first introduced a GA into feedback-based wavefront shaping to find the optimum phase map. Since then, due to its superior performance in noisy environment, the GA has been widely adopted by lots of implementations. However, there have been limited studies discussing and optimizing the detailed procedures of the GA. To fill this blank, in this study, we performed a thorough study on the performance of the GA for focusing light through scattering media.

Wellbores are drilled from the surface of the earth to the underground reservoirs during the drilling operations. Real field drilling operations are complex processes, which suffer from several problems such as drill pipe stuck up, wellbore instability, shale caving, sand, and loose formations etc. Drill pipe stuck up is one of the most common complications during the drilling process, which can be avoided by its early detection and identification. However, detection of drill pipe stuck up is a challenging multiclass pattern recognition problem that involves high dimensional, nonlinear, noisy, and imbalanced data. This paper proposes a Twin support vector machine (TwinSVM) based learning model for automatic detection and identification of stuck pipe events. The proposed model has been implemented on the MATLAB platform and tested on five different datasets acquired from an Iranian oil field. The hyperplane parameters of TwinSVM are optimized using Genetic algorithm (GA). The performance of the TwinSVM model is compared with six additional classifiers including artificial neural networks and support vector machine. The test outcomes, analyzed and presented in the paper, clearly indicate the superiority of TwinSVM over other classifiers used for identification of pipe stuck up events. © 2019 IEEE.",differential pipe sticking; drill pipe stuck up; drilling complications; imbalanced dataset; support vector machine; Twin support vector machine,Automatic identification; Boreholes; Drill pipe; Drills; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks; Oil well drilling equipment; Oil wells; Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Underground reservoirs; Vectors; Automatic Detection; Detection and identifications; differential pipe sticking; Imbalanced dataset; Multiclass pattern recognition; Natural hydrocarbons; Twin support vector machines; Wellbore instability; Infill drilling,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781728102979,,,English,"Proc.

This is particularly true for the potential contamination of drinking water by nearby extraction of oil and/or gas from wells completed by hydraulic fracturing. A case that has attracted considerable attention is unconventional natural gas extraction in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, particularly around Dimock, Pennsylvania. We analyzed surface water and groundwater samples collected throughout Susquehanna County with complementary biological assays and high-resolution mass spectrometry. We found that Ah receptor activity was associated with proximity to impaired gas wells. We also identified certain chemicals, including disclosed hydraulic fracturing fluid additives, in samples that were either in close proximity to impaired gas wells or that exhibited a biological effect. In addition to correlations with drilling activity, the biological assays and high-resolution mass spectrometry detected substances that arose from other anthropogenic sources. Our complementary approach provides a more comprehensive picture of water quality by considering both biological effects and a broad screening for chemical contaminants. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Additives; Agricultural robots; Extraction; Fossil fuels; Fracturing fluids; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Hydraulic fracturing; Hydrochemistry; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Natural gas wells; Potable water; Water quality; Anthropogenic sources; Biological effects; Chemical contaminants; High resolution mass spectrometry; Incomplete knowledge; Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometries; Surface water and groundwaters; Unconventional natural gas; Surface waters; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; ground water; surface water; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; fresh water; steroid receptor; Article; bioassay; controlled study; fracking; gas field; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; Pennsylvania; priority journal; water analysis; water sampling; analysis; bioassay; environmental monitoring; fracking; human; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolism; oil and gas field; pharmacology; procedures; tumor cell line; water pollutant; Biological Assay; Cell Line, Tumor; Chromatography, Liquid; Environmental Monitoring; Fresh Water; Humans; Hydraulic Fracking; Mass Spectrometry; Oil and Gas Fields; Pennsylvania; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Receptors, Steroid; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Oswald, R.E.; Department of Molecular Medicine, United States; эл. почта: reo1@cornell.edu",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,31093631.0,English,Environ.

On the basis of zip codes, we created two groups: PR (1920 patients) and San Fernando Valley (SFV) (15 260 patients) and examined the proportion of outpatient visits to VA providers with respiratory-related diagnoses between October 2014 and September 2017.Results We observed an increase in the proportion of visits in the PR group during the leak (7.0% vs 6.1%, P<0.005) and immediately after the leak (7.7% vs 5.3%, P<0.0001). For both groups, we observed a decrease in respiratory diagnoses one year after the leak (7.0% to 5.9%, P<0.05 PR; 6.1% to 5.7%, P<0.01 SFV).Conclusion Exposure to natural gas likely led to the observed increase in respiratory-related diagnoses during and after the PR gas leak.

Gas prices around the world face substantial volatility, inducing major downside market risks. Forecasting accuracy is thus a major concern for the consumers. Traditional econometrics models do not perform well due to inherent nonlinear and nonstationary gas price data. We thus propose an Autoregressive Neural Network (ARNN) model for forecasting daily spot gas prices. The model is benchmarked against the traditional Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Using a cross validation study, the ARNN model showed an improvement of around 33% over ARIMA in terms of mean squared error. This improvement is significant when price forecasts are used in gas purchase decisions. © 2019 IEEE.",ARIMA; artifical neural network; forecasting; Natural gas; nonlinear autoregressive neural network; spot prices,Costs; Economics; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Mean square error; Natural gas; Neural networks; Security of data; Statistics; ARIMA; Artifical neural networks; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Autoregressive neural networks; Econometrics model; Forecasting accuracy; Mean squared error; Spot price; Gases,"Siddiqui, A.W.; Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Saudi Arabia; эл. почта: awsiddiqui@iau.edu.sa",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781728101088,,,English,"Int.

The push to properly dispose, reuse, or recycle the large amounts of produced fluids associated with hydraulic fracturing operations and design better fracturing fluids has necessitated a better understanding of the subsurface chemical reactions taking place during hydrocarbon extraction. Using autoclave reactors, this study mimics the conditions of deep subsurface shale reservoirs to observe the chemical evolution of fluids during the shut-in phase of hydraulic fracturing (HF), a period when hydraulic fracturing fluids (HFFs) remain confined in the reservoir. The experiment was conducted by combining a synthetic hydraulic fracturing fluid and powdered shale core samples in high temperature/pressure static autoclave reactors for 14 days. Shale samples of varying maturity and mineralogy were used to assess the effect of these variations on the proliferation of inorganic ions and low molecular weight volatile organic compounds (VOCs), mainly benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) and monosubstituted carboxylic acids. Ion chromatography results indicate that the relative abundance of ions present was similar to that of water produced from HF operations in the Marcellus Shale basin. There was an increase of SO42- and PO43- and a decrease in Ba2+ upon fluid-shale reaction. Major ionic shifts indicate calcite dissolution in two of the fluid-shale reactions and barite precipitation in all fluid-shale reactions. Toluene, xylene, and carboxylic acids were produced in the shale-free control experiment. The most substantial increase in BTEX analytes was observed in reactions with low maturity shale, while the high maturity shale reaction produced no measurable BTEX compounds. Total organic carbon decreased in all reactions including fracturing fluid and shale, suggesting adsorption onto the organic matter (OM) matrix. The results from this study highlight that both the nature of OM and mineralogy play a key role in determining the fate of inorganic and organic compounds during fluid-shale interactions in the subsurface shale reservoir. Overall this study aims to contribute to the growing understanding of complex chemical interactions that occur in the shale reservoirs during HF, which is vital for determining the potential environmental impacts of HF and designing more efficient HFF and produced water recycling techniques for environmentally conscious natural gas production. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Autoclaves; Calcite; Carboxylic acids; Environmental impact; Extraction; Fracturing fluids; Hydraulic fracturing; Ion chromatography; Ions; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Organic carbon; Pressure vessels; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Water recycling; Xylene; Calcite dissolution; Chemical evolution; Environmental science; Fracturing operations; Low molecular weight; Natural gas extraction; Natural-gas production; Total Organic Carbon; Shale; benzene; calcium carbonate; carboxylic acid derivative; ethylbenzene; ion; toluene; volatile organic compound; xylene; mineral; natural gas; volatile organic compound; adsorption; Article; dissolution; ion chromatography; liquid; mineralogy; oil shale; precipitation; priority journal; rock; total organic carbon; analysis; chemistry; fracking; oil and gas field; theoretical model; United States; waste water; water pollutant; Appalachian Region; Hydraulic Fracking; Minerals; Models, Theoretical; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Sharma, S.; West Virginia University, 98 Beechurst Ave., United States; эл. почта: shikha.sharma@mail.wvu.edu",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,30840020.0,English,Environ.

We have used two federal datasets, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Emissions Inventory and Greenhouse Gas Inventory, to determine what is known concerning emissions from the compressor stations along natural gas pipelines in the state. From a total of 74 compressor stations only 18 report to EPA on emissions. In the seven year period between 2008 and 2014 they released a total of 36.99 million pounds of air pollutants, not including CO2 and methane. This included emissions of 39 chemicals known to be human carcinogens. There was in addition 6.1 billion pounds of greenhouse gases release from ten stations in a single year. These data clearly underestimate the total releases from the state’s natural gas transportation and distribution system. However, they demonstrate significant releases of air pollutants, some of which are known to cause human disease.

Methanol (MeOH) is one such product, and is one of the most widely used chemicals, employed as a feedstock for ≈30% of industrial chemicals. The starting materials are analogous to those feeding natural processes: water, CO 2 , and light. Innovative technologies from this effort have global significance, as they allow GHG recycling, while providing society with a renewable carbon feedstock. Light, in the form of solar energy, assists the production process in some capacity. Various solar strategies of continually increasing technology readiness levels are compared to the commercial MeOH process, which uses a syngas feed derived from natural gas. These strategies include several key technologies, including solar-thermochemical, photochemical, and photovoltaic–electrochemical. Other solar-assisted technologies that are not yet commercial-ready are also discussed. The commercial-ready technologies are compared using a technoeconomic analysis, and the scalability of solar reactors is also discussed in the context of light-incorporating catalyst architectures and designs. Finally, how MeOH compares against other prospective products is briefly discussed, as well as the viability of the most promising solar MeOH strategy in an international context. © 2019 The Authors.

Surface coal mining and processing impose public health risks on residential communities through air and water pollution. Burning coal in power plants emits more nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and heavy metals per unit of energy than any other fuel source and impairs global public health. Coal ash disposal exposes communities to heavy metals and particulate matter waste. Use of coal in domestic households causes public health harm concentrated in developing nations. Across the coal continuum, adverse impacts are disproportionately felt by persons of poor socioeconomic status, contributing to health inequities. Despite efforts to develop renewable energy sources, coal use has not declined on a global scale. Concentrated efforts to eliminate coal as an energy source are imperative to improve public health and avert serious climate change consequences.

The majority of the rural population use crop residue, firewood, and dung cake as cooking fuel sources. Combustion of these fuels emits life-threatening pollutants that contaminate the household environment, which can have serious health consequences, especially for young children. This study examines the use of cooking fuel sources and their association with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children aged 0–59 months. Study design: This study used data from the second update of the Annual Health Survey (2012–13). The prevalence rate was measured in terms of the number of children per 1000 children suffering from ARIs. Bivariate analysis was used to analyze the use of different cooking fuels (in percentage) and the prevalence of ARIs in Uttar Pradesh. Methods: District-level variations in the cooking fuels used were assessed by simple bivariate analysis for all districts of Uttar Pradesh. A logistic regression was used to examine the association of household environment and pollutants with ARIs. Results: In total, 89 per 1000 children suffered from ARIs in Uttar Pradesh. Infants (0–11 months) were significantly more likely to suffer from ARIs than older children (12–59 months). Households using dung cake for cooking and kerosene and other oils for lighting were found to have significantly higher odds for ARIs (odds ratio [OR]: 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17–1.25 and OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05–1.10, respectively). A considerable interdistrict difference was observed in the cooking fuel used and the prevalence of ARIs among children aged 0–59 months. Conclusions: The type of cooking fuel and lighting source used were found to be significant predictors of ARIs among children aged 0–59 months. These results highlight the need for targeted efforts for the provision of clean cooking fuels (liquid petroleum gas/biogas/electricity) and for the improvement in knowledge and awareness of ARIs and exposure to cooking and lighting pollution. © 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health",Acute respiratory infections; Cooking fuels; Dung cake; Lighting sources,"biogas; fuel; kerosene; liquefied petroleum gas; natural gas; child health; disease prevalence; health survey; multivariate analysis; pollutant source; pollution exposure; public health; respiratory disease; rural population; age distribution; Article; child; cooking; dung cake; female; human; infant; light pollution; male; prevalence; respiratory tract infection; Uttar Pradesh; cooking; health survey; India; indoor air pollution; newborn; preschool child; procedures; respiratory tract infection; risk factor; rural population; statistics and numerical data; India; Uttar Pradesh; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child, Preschool; Cooking; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; India; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Prevalence; Respiratory Tract Infections; Risk Factors; Rural Population","Patel, S.K.; International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)India; эл. почта: surendrabhu20@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,00333506,,PUHEA,30818105.0,English,Public Health,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061910943

As a leader in transforming to cleaner bus fleets, the Regional Transport Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) has been transitioning from diesel to compressed natural gas (CNG) transit buses since 1999. By 2017, ~75% of RTC’s buses operating in Clark County, Nevada were CNG-powered. This study assesses the health benefits of the venture using the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Co-Benefits Risk Assessment (COBRA) model, considering the emission and exposure changes from the 2017 baseline for two hypothetical scenarios: (1) no transition (CC_D) and (2) complete transition (CC_N). The CC_D scenario shows realized health benefits, mostly due to avoided mortality, of $0.79–8.21 million per year for 2017 alone, while CC_N suggests an additional $0.88–2.24 million annually that could be achieved by completing the transition. The wide range of estimates partly reflects uncertainties in determining diesel bus emissions under business-as-usual. These health benefits were not limited locally, with ~70% going to other counties. Two national-scale scenarios, US_D and US_N, were also constructed to explore the health impact of transitioning from diesel to CNG buses across the U.S. As of 2017, with CNG powering only ~20% of transit bus mileages nationwide, there could be massive unrealized health benefits of $0.98–2.48 billion per year including 114–258 avoided premature deaths and >5000 avoided respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. Taking into account the health benefits, economic costs, and the inter-state nature of air pollution, expanding federal assistances to accelerate a nationwide transition to cleaner bus fleets is highly recommended. © 2019 by the authors.

Study design: This is an ecological study based on county-level data for Pennsylvania, United States, 2003–2014. Methods: We estimated multivariate regressions with county and year fixed effects, using two 12-year panels: all 67 Pennsylvania counties and 54 counties that are not large metropolitan. Results: After correcting for multiple comparisons, we found a positive association of cumulative well density (per km 2 ) with genitourinary hospitalization rates. When large metropolitan counties were excluded, this relationship persisted, and positive associations of skin-related hospitalization rates with cumulative well count and well density were observed. The association with genitourinary hospitalization rates is driven by females in 20–64 years group, particularly for kidney infections, calculus of ureter, and urinary tract infection. Contemporaneous wells drilled were not significantly associated with hospitalizations after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: Our study shows that long-term exposure to unconventional gas development may have an impact on prevalence of hospitalizations for certain diseases in the affected populations and identifies areas of future research on unconventional gas development and health. © 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health",Environmental health; Fracking; Hospitalization; Unconventional gas development,"disease prevalence; health impact; hydraulic fracturing; natural gas; pollution exposure; public health; adult; Article; disease association; environmental exposure; female; fracking; gas; hospitalization; human; kidney infection; major clinical study; male; Pennsylvania; prevalence; skin disease; unconventional natural gas; ureter stone; urinary tract infection; urogenital tract disease; adolescent; aged; child; environmental exposure; fracking; hospitalization; infant; middle aged; newborn; preschool child; statistics and numerical data; time factor; young adult; Pennsylvania; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Hydraulic Fracking; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Pennsylvania; Time Factors; Young Adult","Hill, E.; Department of Public Health Sciences, 265 Crittenden Blvd, United States; эл. почта: elaine_hill@urmc.rochester.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,00333506,,PUHEA,30677623.0,English,Public Health,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060229952

The continuous use and burning of these fossil fuel resources in the industrial, domestic and transport sectors has resulted in the extremely high emission of greenhouse gases, GHGs (e.g. CO2) and solid particulates into the atmosphere. Therefore, it is necessary to explore pollution free and more efficient energy sources in order to replace depleting fossil fuels. The use of hydrogen (H2) as an alternative fuel source is particularly attractive due to its very high specific energy compared to other conventional fuels and its zero GHG emission when used in a fuel cell. Hydrogen can be produced through various process technologies such as thermal, electrolytic, photolytic and biological processes. Thermal processes include gas reforming, renewable liquid and biooil processing, biomass and coal gasification; however, these processes release a huge amount of greenhouse gases. Production of electrolytic hydrogen from water is an attractive method to produce clean hydrogen. It could even be a more promising technology when combining water electrolysis with power ultrasound to produce hydrogen efficiently where sonication enhances the electrolytic process in several ways such as enhanced mass transfer, removal of hydrogen and oxygen (O2) gas bubbles and activation of the electrode surface.

Shale gas fluid samples were collected from two hydraulically fractured wells in Morgantown, WV, USA at the Marcellus Shale Energy and Environment Laboratory (MSEEL) and analyzed using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the dissolved organic sulfur (DOS) pool. Using a non-targeted approach, ions assigned DOS formulas were analyzed to identify dominant DOS classes, describe their temporal trends and their implications, and describe the molecular characteristics of the larger DOS pool. The average molecular weight of organic sulfur compounds in flowback decreased and was lowest in produced waters. The dominant DOS classes were putatively assigned to alcohol sulfate and alcohol ethoxysulfate surfactants, likely injected as fracturing fluid additives, on the basis of exact mass and homolog distribution matching. This DOS signature was identifiable 10 months after the initial injection of hydraulic fracturing fluid, and an absence of genes that code for alcohol ethoxysulfate degrading proteins (e.g., sulfatases) in the shale well genomes and metagenomes support that these additives are not readily degraded biologically and may continue to act as a chemical signature of the injected fluid. Understanding the diversity, lability, and fate of organic sulfur compounds in shale wells is important for engineering productive wells and preventing gas souring as well as understanding the consequences of unintended fluid release to the environment. The diversity of DOS, particularly more polar compounds, needs further investigation to determine if the identified characteristics and temporal patterns are unique to the analyzed wells or represent broader patterns found in other formations and under other operating conditions. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Additives; Coal deposits; Fracturing fluids; Gas permeability; Mass spectrometry; Methane; Resource valuation; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Average molecular weight; Dissolved organic sulfurs; Distribution matching; Energy and environment; Molecular characteristics; Organic sulfur compounds; Ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometries; Unconventional resources; Hydraulic fracturing; alcohol; dissolved organic matter; organosulfur derivative; sulfate; surfactant; methane; natural gas; sulfur; aqueous solution; Article; chemistry; comparative study; controlled study; fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry; fracking; gas field; genome; metagenome; microbial community; microbial genome; molecular weight; nonhuman; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); salinity; solid phase extraction; United States; waste water management; chemistry; mass spectrometry; oil and gas field; waste water; Hydraulic Fracking; Mass Spectrometry; Methane; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Sulfur; Waste Water,"Luek, J.L.; University of New Hampshire, United States; эл. почта: jenna.luek@unh.edu",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,30303509.0,English,Environ.

Here we investigate six permitted discharges on three neighboring tributary systems in Wyoming. During 2013-16, we evaluated radium activities of the permitted discharges and the potential for radium accumulation in associated stream sediments. Radium activities of the sediments at the points of discharge ranged from approximately 200-3600 Bq kg-1 with elevated activities above the background of 74 Bq kg-1 over 30 km downstream of one permitted discharge. Sediment as deep as 30 cm near the point of discharge had radium activities elevated above background. X-ray diffraction and targeted sequential extraction of radium in sediments indicate that radium is likely coprecipitated with carbonate and, to a lesser extent, sulfate minerals. PHREEQC modeling predicts radium coprecipitation with aragonite and barite, but over-estimates the latter compared to observations of downstream sediment, where carbonate predominates.

As HVHF has expanded into the populous northeastern USA, some residents have become concerned about impacts on water quality. Scientists have addressed this concern by investigating individual case studies or by statistically assessing the rate of problems. In general, however, lack of access to new or historical water quality data hinders the latter assessments. We introduce a new statistical approach to assess water quality datasets-especially sets that differ in data volume and variance-and apply the technique to one region of intense shale gas development in northeastern Pennsylvania (PA) and one with fewer shale gas wells in northwestern PA. The new analysis for the intensely developed region corroborates an earlier analysis based on a different statistical test: in that area, changes in groundwater chemistry show no degradation despite that area's dense development of shale gas. In contrast, in the region with fewer shale gas wells, we observe slight but statistically significant increases in concentrations in some solutes in groundwaters. One potential explanation for the slight changes in groundwater chemistry in that area (northwestern PA) is that it is the regional focus of the earliest commercial development of conventional oil and gas (O&G) in the USA. Alternate explanations include the use of brines from conventional O&G wells as well as other salt mixtures on roads in that area for dust abatement or de-icing, respectively. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chemical analysis; Degradation; Dust abatement; Gases; Groundwater; Hydraulic fracturing; Natural gas wells; Shale gas; Water quality; Commercial development; Conventional oil and gas; Developed regions; Gas development; Groundwater chemistry; Salt mixtures; Statistical approach; Water quality data; Hydrochemistry; anion; calcium; cation; chloride; ground water; hydrocarbon; iron; magnesium; manganese; methane; potassium; sodium; sulfate; ground water; natural gas; petroleum; water; alkalinity; Article; comparative study; concentration (parameter); conductance; environmental parameters; fracking; gas field; hardness; landscape; offshore oil industry; oil and gas field; oil shale; Pennsylvania; priority journal; solute; total dissolved solid; turbidity; water quality; water standard; analysis; chemistry; fracking; oil and gas field; water pollutant; water quality; Groundwater; Hydraulic Fracking; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Pennsylvania; Petroleum; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality","Xue, L.; Department of Statistics, United States; эл. почта: lzxue@psu.edu",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,30608109.0,English,Environ.

Biological treatment of produced water is a potential approach to remove organic constituents and reduce fouling, in conjunction with other treatment processes. This study investigates the biological treatability of produced water samples from the Utica and Bakken Shales using engineered biofilms. Observed total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal varied between 1-87% at normalized total dissolved solids concentrations, suggesting that the composition of produced water, including organic constituents and trace elements such as nutrients and metals, is an important driver of biological treatment performance. Mass spectrometric analyses of the DOC composition revealed various alkanes in all samples, but differences in non-ionic surfactant, halogenated, and acidic compound content. Statistical data reduction approaches suggest that the latter two groups are correlated with reduced biodegradation kinetics. These results demonstrate that the combination of biodegradation performance and organic speciation can guide the assessment of the biological treatment of produced water. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Biochemical engineering; Biodegradation; Fracture; Hydraulic fracturing; Mass spectrometry; Organic carbon; Produced Water; Trace elements; Water conservation; Biodegradation performance; Biological treatability; Biological treatment; Dissolved organic carbon; Mass spectrometric analysis; Organic constituents; Reduced biodegradation; Total dissolved solids; Water treatment; alkane; halide; metal; nonionic surfactant; organic carbon; organic compound; water; carbon; natural gas; organic compound; Article; biodegradation; biofilm; degradation kinetics; fracking; mixed cell culture; nutrient; priority journal; salinity; total organic carbon; water sampling; bioremediation; chemistry; isolation and purification; waste water; water pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biofilms; Carbon; Hydraulic Fracking; Natural Gas; Organic Chemicals; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Bibby, K.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, United States; эл. почта: kbibby@nd.edu",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,30451271.0,English,Environ.

Contamination can be a source of stress and bacterial responses can serve as an indicator of environmental abnormality. In this work, the biochemical effects of toxic compounds that stem from hydraulic fracturing were measured on the whole cell-derived fatty acid and protein compositions of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis. These microorganisms were exposed to elevated levels of benzene, ethanol, propanol, toluene, and salt. These were chosen to represent significant subsurface contamination or a surface spill. The fatty acid and protein profiles for the bacteria were analyzed using gas chromatography-vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, respectively. Overall, different fatty acid and protein profiles were observed when the microorganisms were grown in the presence of the toxic compounds. The cells exhibited an increase in the saturated/unsaturated ratio and displayed the presence of branched and cyclopropane fatty acids when in the presence of common fracture fluid constituents to decrease membrane permeability which was confirmed by the analysis of produced water.

This research uses hydraulic fracturing (i.e., fracking) operations in New Zealand as a vignette through which to understand the underlying causes of controversy and the appropriateness of attempts to address them. A multi-method approach using interviews (n = 25), diagrammatic analysis, and newsprint media was applied to evidence two major findings. First, previous attempts to explain fracking controversy based on social constructivist theory lack a multi-scalar approach to the assessment of factors that influence risk perceptions. It is found that risk perception surrounding fracking in New Zealand reflects intra-scalar interactions between factors originating at the international, national, regional, and local scale. Second, there is a concerning absence of critique pertaining to the concept of “social license to operate” (SLO), which has been advocated both internationally and nationally as an appropriate form of stakeholder engagement. This article contributes to the SLO outcomes literature by establishing a need to consider multi-scalar influences on risk perception when explaining diverse SLO outcomes in communities where fracking operations are prospective or already taking place. © 2018 The Authors Risk Analysis published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Risk Analysis.",Hydraulic fracturing; risk perception; social license to operate,Fracture; Hydraulic fracturing; Risk assessment; License to operate; Lightning rods; Local scale; Multi scalars; Multi-method approach; Multi-scale frameworks; Stakeholder engagement; Underlying cause; Risk perception; assessment method; earthquake event; hydraulic fracturing; risk perception; stakeholder; New Zealand; natural gas; earthquake; environmental monitoring; fracking; human; lightning; mass medium; New Zealand; procedures; prospective study; public opinion; reproducibility; risk assessment; Earthquakes; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydraulic Fracking; Lightning; Mass Media; Natural Gas; New Zealand; Prospective Studies; Public Opinion; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment,"Pollard, J.A.; Department of Geography, United Kingdom; эл. почта: jp646@cam.ac.uk",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,02724332,,RIAND,30110516.0,English,Risk Anal.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052398997

In these days, the productivity and quality of agricultural products can be improved by using the modern technology that can meet the growing demand for food of the world population and which is environment friendly. In the field of agriculture, the use of nanomaterials improves the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural practices by applying less input and generating less waste as compared to the conventional products and approaches. The success of the use of nanoparticles for disease suppression, nutritional improvement, and yield increase may depend on the particle-size difference between the “bulk” and “nano” types of materials. In this chapter, we discuss the effects of nanosized micronutrient fertilizers on improving crop yields of plants toward a sustainable environment. In this case, the nanostructured microelements of plants, such as Cu, Fe, Ni, Mn, Si, Co, Se, and Zn, play critical roles in plant disease resistance by enzyme activation and in improving the efficiency of energy production by photosynthetic machinery for defensive mechanisms.

The paper presents the results of the evaluation of the safety and efficiency of using UV irradiatorsrecirculators of a closed type, used for disinfecting air in the premises of medical facilities. Material and methods. The studies included three types of UV irradiators-recirculators of the closed type of various brands. The safety assessment included: 1) ultraviolet radiation measurements; 2) the influence of devices on chemical pollution of indoor air; 3) the impact on the natural gas composition and microclimate; 4) measurement of ozone concentrations; 5) measurement of electromagnetic radiation; 6) measurements of sound levels. Evaluation of the effectiveness of disinfection was performed on the total microbial number; the content of mold fungi and coliphages per 1 m3 of air. Results. A safety assessment of the operation of closed-type ultraviolet irradiators-recirculators showed the devices under study, equipped with zone-free mercury lamps to be not sources of ozone and nitrogen dioxide emission into the air. However, from the bodies of two of the investigated devices, UV radiation with a wavelength of 200-280 nm was detected. It is established that UV irradiators-recirculators of the closed type can be sources of increased noise and electromagnetic radiation. The intensity of these factors inside of premises depends on the distance to the operating device. It is established the safe operating distance of such devices. It has been revealed that long-term operation of closed-type UV irradiators-recirculators can give rise elevation of the ambient air temperature and an increase in the concentration of saturated and acyclic hydrocarbons in the air. As a result of the evaluation of the disinfecting effect of the studied UV irradiators-recirculators, a different degree of effectiveness of their influence on the bacterial and fungal flora was established. Conclusion. The necessity of developing a methodological document regulating the procedure and scope of research in assessing the safety and efficiency of using UV irradiators-recirculators of a closed type for disinfecting air in medical institutions in the presence of people is substantiated. © 2019 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

Microbial activity is usually regarded as an important driving force to generate shallow gas via metabolizing the environmental substrates. Therefore, the research on the microbial communities will be helpful to reveal the distribution of shallow gas in the gas-bearing formation. In this study, 30 sediment samples below the seabed in Hangzhou Bay (China) from depths of 1.5 m to 55 m were collected to investigate their microbial community, environmental characteristics and sediment type (clay or sand). It turned out that the presence of shallow gas had a good correlation with the distribution of archaea rather than bacteria, with the dominant microbe of Bathyarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota in the formation. Methanosarcinaceae and ANME-1a with the capacity of methane metabolism occupied high proportions. The correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) suggested that ammonium was a key environmental substrate to indicate the microbial community in the formation. The sediment type was proposed to shape environmental substrates in the formation, thus further affecting the microbial communities. The clay strata were demonstrated to have an important role in the generation and distribution of shallow gas, and more attention should be paid in terms of its resource discovery and engineering safety assessment. © 2019 Yu, Zhang, Kang, Zhao, Ding, Lin, Xu, Hong, Wang and Zheng.",Environmental substrates; Gas bearing formation; Microbial community; Sediment type; Shallow gas,ammonia; natural gas; Article; China; chromatography; correlation analysis; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; elemental analysis; environmental factor; gas analysis; human; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; oxidation; physical chemistry; redundancy analysis,"Zheng, P.; Department of Environmental Engineering, China; эл. почта: pzheng@zju.edu.cn",,Frontiers Media S.A.,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

These chemical senses largely determine the flavor of foods and beverages, impact food intake, and ultimately nutrition, and provide a warning for spoiled or poisonous food, leaking natural gas, smoke, airborne pollutants, and other hazards. Hence, toxicants that damage these senses have a significant impact on everyday function. As noted in detail, a large number of toxicants encountered in urban and industrial air pollution, including smoke, solvents, metals, and particulate matter can alter the ability to smell. Their influence on taste, i.e., sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and savory (umami) sensations, is not well documented. Given the rather direct exposure of olfactory receptors to the outside environment, olfaction is particularly vulnerable to damage from toxicants. Some toxicants, such as nanoparticles, have the potential to damage not only the olfactory receptor cells, but also the central nervous system structures by their entrance into the brain through the olfactory mucosa. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Alzheimer's disease; Assessment; Neurotoxins; Occupational medicine; Olfaction; Poisoning; Psychophysics; Sensory perception; Taste; Xenobiotics,brain; human; odor; pathophysiology; physiology; sensation; smelling disorder; taste; toxicity and intoxication; Brain; Humans; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Olfaction Disorders; Sensation; Smell; Taste,"Doty, R.L.; Department of Otorhinolaryngology: Head and Neck Surgery, United States; эл. почта: richard.doty@uphs.upenn.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,00729752,,,31604559.0,English,Handb.

Unlike vision, hearing, balance, and touch, they are rarely evaluated quantitatively in the clinic, even though hundreds of thousands of persons seek medical help annually for disorders of these senses. Chemosensory disorders impact quality of life, including the flavor of foods and beverages, and compromise the ability to detect such environmental hazards as fires, leaking natural gas, and spoiled foodstuffs. Moreover, olfactory dysfunction can be a harbinger for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, and is known to triple the likelihood of mortality in older persons over the course of 4 or 5 years. Without accurate testing, one cannot establish the veracity of a patient's complaint, the probability of malingering, the impact of treatments, and whether the degree of dysfunction is normal relative to a patient's age and sex.

Upon completion of a well, the fluid returns to the surface (produced water) and contains natural gas, subsurface constituents, and microorganisms (Barbot et al., 2013; Daly et al., 2016). While the microbial community of the produced fluids has been studied in multiple gas wells, the activity of these microorganisms and their relation to biogeochemical activity is not well understood. In this experiment, we supplemented produced fluid with 13C-labeled carbon sources (glucose, acetate, bicarbonate, methanol, or methane), and 15N-labeled ammonium chloride in order to isotopically trace microbial activity over multiple day in anoxic incubations. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) was used to generate isotopic images of 13C and 15N incorporation in individual cells, while isotope ratio monitoring-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (IRM-GC-MS) was used to measure 13CO2, and 13CH4 as metabolic byproducts. Glucose, acetate, and methanol were all assimilated by microorganisms under anoxic conditions. 13CO2 production was only observed with glucose as a substrate indicating that catabolic activity was limited to this condition. The microbial communities observed at 0, 19, and 32 days of incubation did not vary between different carbon sources, were low in diversity, and composed primarily of the class Clostridia. The primary genera detected in the incubations, Halanaerobium and Fusibacter, are known to be adapted to harsh physical and chemical conditions consistent with those that occur in the hydrofracturing environment. This study provides evidence that microorganisms in produced fluid are revivable in laboratory incubations and retained the ability to metabolize added carbon and nitrogen substrates. © 2019 Morono, Wishart, Ito, Ijiri, Hoshino, Torres, Verba, Terada, Inagaki and Colwell.

The present study examines learning processes for ninefire brigades in Norway, selected where Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facilities are in their jurisdictionand/or because they have handled LNG road accidents. The process of acquiring the necessary newknowledge and skills is researched inductively, and each FB is viewed as a unit in the Norwegian fireand rescue community, i.e., a multi-unit learning organization. Kolb's learning cycle is used to discussthe findings. Large variations in learning processes were used in the different FBs, varying from shortclassroom courses held by external consultants to a series of learning episodes planned and directedby FB personnel. It was found that each FB focused locally and independently from other FBs whenacquiring new knowledge. There was very limited knowledge transfer from FBs experienced withLNG facilities to ""newcomers"". There is no established national knowledge-sharing network on LNG.There are, however, regional partner groups, mainly involving the FB and a distribution company,mentioned by all studied FBs to be the most important partner for learning. The inter-municipalcommittee against acute pollution (IUA) was the second most important learning cooperation partner.It was, however, discovered that LNG test releases gave rise to observations regarding the extensionof the flammable cloud versus the visible cloud that was interpreted wrongly due to the lack oftheoretical understanding of the influence of the air relative humidity. This was explained to oneregional partner group that invited, and therefore asked, an academic about this issue during atraining session. This partner group arranged demonstrations for all FBs involved along the pathof LNG transport from the production site to their end-users. Surprisingly, there was very limitedknowledge exchange between partner groups in different geographical regions, though one of thesewas certainly more knowledgeable.

To raise people’s awareness of this risk, three surveys monitored indoor radon concentrations in 6,010 houses in Brittany and Limousin, France, between 2011 and 2016. A kit was distributed to each household, including a passive dosimeter, a user manual, and a questionnaire about certain characteristics of the dwelling. The dosimeter was exposed for two months in winter, at the lowest level of the house occupied at least one hour per day. The median radon concentration in the 6,010 houses was 167 Bq.m -3 the 5 th percentile was 36 Bq.m -3 and the 95 th percentile 1,161 Bq.m -3 . A hierarchical linear regression was used to study the determinants of indoor radon concentrations. The results show that they are influenced by eight variables: soil radon potential, type of foundation, main construction material, construction period, number of occupied levels, dosimeter location, window replacement, and type of ventilation. The soil radon potential is the variable with the strongest influence. This study confirms already well-known radon determinants but also reveals other less studied variables (i.e. the type of ventilation) and previously unknown variables that may influence the indoor radon concentration (i.e. window replacement).

However, due to the short establishment time of China’s carbon trading market, the carbon trading price data of the pilot markets were not complete and have the typical characteristics of poor information. The traditional grey correlation model cannot effectively identify the volatility and the grey correlation coefficient of trading data. In this paper, an inscribed cored grey relational analysis model (IC-GRA) is constructed by extracting the values of the triangle inscribed center of the time series sample. Through numerical examples and empirical analysis, it is verified that IC-GRA not only satisfies the four axioms of traditional grey correlation but also avoids the influence of outliers of time series fluctuation and improves the discriminability of the grey correlation coefficient. The empirical results of the IC-GRA model in China’s seven pilot carbon trading markets show that: 1. among international carbon trade factor, the biggest influence factor carbon trade price is different in pilot markets. The price of natural gas has a greater correlation with the carbon price of carbon trading markets in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. The futures price of Certified Emission Reduction (CER) has a strong correlation with the carbon price of Shanghai and Beijing carbon trading markets; the price of Hubei carbon trading market is the largest related to crude oil future price in the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX). 2. Air Quality Index (AQI) is most relevant to the market carbon price of carbon trading, followed by the trading turnover and trading volume of the carbon trading market. Therefore, studying the carbon trading price of the carbon trading market plays a positive role in improving the sustainable development in those areas. © 2018 by the authors.

The indoor relative humidity for the heating by the electricity and the natural gas was lower than that by the traditional coal fire. The indoor air quality (IAQ) for the heating by the electricity and the natural gas was better than that by the traditional coal fire. For traditional coal-fire heating households, the indoor pollutant emission (CO emission) by using the clean coal was lower than that by using the raw coal. The indoor ventilation rate which was an important parameter for the indoor air quality was generally poor in winter.

Unlike traditional petroleum industry, shale gas exploitation covers a wider area and there are more well sites, the adverse effects of OBDC piled up around well sites are even greater. This study investigated the pollution status and leaching toxicity of eight heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in OBDC of shale gas exploitation, and evaluated the health risks of the drilling workers. The results showed that heavy metal pollution in OBDC was moderate, and the leaching toxicity was far below the standard value. Non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of drilling workers were within an acceptable range. Meanwhile, in order to reduce the health risks of drilling workers, some suggestions are proposed to reduce the exposure risks of workers and the content of heavy metals in OBDC. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Hazardous waste; Heavy metal; Human health risk assessment; Leaching toxicity; Oil-based drill cuttings; Shale gas industry,"cadmium; chromium; copper; heavy metal; lead; manganese; mercury; nickel; zinc; heavy metal; natural gas; cutting (process); drilling; gas industry; hazardous waste; health risk; heavy metal; risk assessment; shale gas; toxicity; Article; carcinogenicity; chemical composition; China; controlled study; drilling worker; ecotoxicity; hazardous waste; health hazard; human; leaching; nonmedical occupations; occupational exposure; occupational hazard; offshore oil industry; oil based drill cutting; oil shale; pollution; risk assessment; risk reduction; acid rain; analysis; chemistry; industrial waste; oil industry; pollution; prevention and control; risk assessment; soil pollutant; toxicity; China; Chongqing; Acid Rain; China; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Industrial Waste; Metals, Heavy; Natural Gas; Occupational Exposure; Oil and Gas Industry; Risk Assessment; Soil Pollutants","Wang, X.; Department of Resources and Environmental Science, Room 216, China; эл. почта: xiangwang@cqu.edu.cn",,Academic Press,01476513,,EESAD,30195208.0,English,Ecotoxicol.

This dependence on water makes electricity generation vulnerable to droughts. Furthermore, because power sector CO 2 emissions amount to approximately one third of total US emissions, droughts could influence the inter-annual variability of state- and national-scale emissions. However, the magnitude of drought-induced changes in power sector emissions is not well understood, especially in the context of climate mitigation policies. Using multivariate linear regressions, we find that droughts are positively correlated to increases in electricity generation from natural gas in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington; and from coal in Colorado, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Using a statistical model, we estimate that this shift in generation sources led to total increases in regional emissions of 100 Mt of CO 2 , 45 kt of SO 2 , and 57 kt of NO x from 2001 to 2015, most of which originated in California, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming. The CO 2 emissions induced by droughts in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington amounted to 7%-12% of the total CO 2 emissions from their respective power sectors, and the yearly rates were 8%-15% of their respective 2030 yearly targets outlined in the Clean Power Plan (CPP). Although there is uncertainty surrounding the CPP, its targets provide appropriate reference points for climate mitigation goals for the power sector. Given the global importance of hydroelectric and thermoelectric power, our results represent a critical step in quantifying the impact of drought on pollutant emissions from the power sector - and thus on mitigation targets - in other regions of the world. © 2018 The Author(s).

We present a novel basis for informing uncertainty in energy data by quantifying the changes in reported energy consumption as countries update their previously reported data. We use 17 editions of the British Petroleum World Energy Statistics (2001-2017) to evaluate how reported energy consumption is revised over time in aggregate coal, oil, and natural gas consumption data. We find that 70% of non-zero data points are adjusted by an average of 1.3% of a country's total fossil fuel use in the year after their first publication. Earlier data points are revised less often, but almost half of historical trends contain some revisions in later years. The size and rate of data revisions vary over countries and fuels: coal data points have larger, less frequent revisions while oil data points have smaller more frequent revisions, with natural gas in between. A k-means cluster analysis was performed to group together countries with similar revision patterns. These groups span income, economy classification, OECD membership, and regions. Standard country groupings, therefore, do not predict the extent to which a country's energy data has undergone revisions in the past. © 2018 The Author(s).

Fossil-fuel burning and cement production release ∼90% of all CO 2 emissions from human activities. After a three-year hiatus with stable global emissions (Jackson et al 2016; Le Quéré C et al 2018a ; IEA 2018), CO 2 emissions grew by 1.6% in 2017 to 36.2 Gt (billion tonnes), and are expected to grow a further 2.7% in 2018 (range: 1.8%-3.7%) to a record 37.1 2 Gt CO 2 (Le Quéré et al 2018b). Additional increases in 2019 remain uncertain but appear likely because of persistent growth in oil and natural gas use and strong growth projected for the global economy. Coal use has slowed markedly in the last few years, potentially peaking, but its future trajectory remains uncertain. Despite positive progress in ∼19 countries whose economies have grown over the last decade and their emissions have declined, growth in energy use from fossil-fuel sources is still outpacing the rise of low-carbon sources and activities. A robust global economy, insufficient emission reductions in developed countries, and a need for increased energy use in developing countries where per capita emissions remain far below those of wealthier nations will continue to put upward pressure on CO 2 emissions. Peak emissions will occur only when total fossil CO 2 emissions finally start to decline despite growth in global energy consumption, with fossil energy production replaced by rapidly growing low- or no-carbon technologies. © 2018 The Author(s).

Since the pipelines are buried, they are largely invisible and awareness is low until there is a serious accident (e.g. Ghislenghien, San Bruno). Importantly, pipeline integrity is threatened by activities of third parties outside the pipeline sector such as local councils, other utilities and civil contractors doing work on other kinds of infrastructure. This paper focuses on how Dial Before You Dig (DBYD) – Australia's one-call service for those doing civil works – functions at the boundary between the social worlds of various relevant actors. Drawing on more than 50 interviews with those involved in work near pipelines, we conceptualize DBYD as a boundary object. The pipeline sector sees DBYD as an effective system that minimizes risk to their assets. Those working near pipelines see it as a system that should support their own business goals. Nevertheless, the interpretive flexibility of DBYD allows cooperation without complete consensus. The boundary object framework reveals three key aspects of the social architecture provided by DBYD – the extent to which temporal considerations vary, the way in which the system institutionalises conflict and how DBYD constitutes a form of surveillance by one sector over another. The paper argues that as more essential services, including those that are potentially hazardous, are located in the ‘crowded underground’ below our cities, it is more important than ever to understand how the relevant actors interact. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Boundary objects; One-call services; Pipeline safety,Renewable energy resources; Safety testing; Boundary objects; Effective systems; Essential services; High pressure natural gas; One-call services; Pipeline integrity; Pipeline safety; Social architecture; Natural gas pipelines; accident; accident prevention; Article; Australia; city; commercial phenomena; consensus; construction work; controlled study; cooperation; human; interview; occupational safety; pipeline; priority journal; risk reduction; social aspect; work environment,"Hayes, J.; School of Property, City Campus, 360 Swanston Street, PO Box 2476, Australia; эл. почта: jan.hayes2@rmit.edu.au",,Elsevier B.V.,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

Quantifying these policies' health co-benefits provides a local and near-term rationale for actions that also mitigate global climate change and its accompanying harms. Here, we assess the health benefits of a carbon fee-and-rebate policy directed at fuel use in transport, residential and commercial buildings and industry in Massachusetts. We find that the air pollution reductions from this policy would save 340 lives (95% CI: 82-590), 64% of which would occur in Massachusetts, and reduce carbon emissions by 33 million metric tons, with 2017 as an implementation year, through 2040. When monetized, the benefits to health may be larger than the benefits from climate mitigation, but are sensitive to valuation methods, discount rates, and the leakage rate of natural gas, among other factors. These benefits derive largely from lower transportation emissions, including volatile organic compounds from gasoline combustion. Reductions in oil and coal use have relatively large benefits, despite their limited use in Massachusetts. This study finds substantial health benefits of a proposed statewide carbon policy in Massachusetts that carries near-term and direct benefit to residents of the commonwealth and demonstrates the importance of co-benefits modeling. © 2018 The Author(s).

Although the metabolisms of certain fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea that dominate in later produced fluids have been well studied, few details have been reported on microorganisms prevelant during the early flowback period, when oxygen and other surface-derived oxyanions and nutrients become depleted. Here, we report the isolation, genomic and phenotypic characterization of Marinobacter and Arcobacter bacterial species from natural-gas wells in the Utica-Point Pleasant and Marcellus Formations coupled to supporting geochemical and metagenomic analyses of produced fluid samples. These unconventional hydrocarbon system-derived Marinobacter sp. are capable of utilizing a diversity of organic carbon sources including aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, amino acids, and carboxylic acids. Marinobacter and Arcobacter can metabolize organic nitrogen sources and have the capacity for denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) respectively; with DNRA and ammonification processes partially explaining high concentrations of ammonia measured in produced fluids. Arcobacter is capable of chemosynthetic sulfur oxidation, which could fuel metabolic processes for other heterotrophic, fermentative, or sulfate-reducing community members. Our analysis revealed mechanisms for growth of these taxa across a broad range of salinities (up to 15% salt), which explains their enrichment during early natural-gas production. These results demonstrate the prevalence of Marinobacter and Arcobacter during a key maturation phase of hydraulically fractured natural-gas wells, and highlight the significant role these genera play in biogeochemical cycling for this economically important energy system.

We developed a spatial-explicit model at a county level to understand the GHG trade-offs associated with different spatial-temporal CCS and clean fuels dissemination strategies. A business as usual (BAU) and three alternative scenarios with different targets for CCS and LPG dissemination were constructed. Results show that a scenario focusing exclusively on a fast LPG-penetration does not deliver the largest GHG benefits, as there is substantial stacking with traditional open fires. On the contrary, the combination of CCS plancha-type stoves disseminated in regions with high non-renewable fuelwood harvesting (fNRB) together with LPG, allows minimizing of stacking with traditional fires and provide the largest benefits. Also, different scenarios result in contrasting spatial distribution of target counties and mitigation benefits, and therefore have important public policy implications. Cumulative mitigation ranged from 50 MtCO2 e to 126.3 MtCO2 e , depending on the scenario, representing from 14% to 35% of BAU emissions, and up to 11% of projected country GHG emissions to 2030. A sensitivity analysis also showed that despite the variation across three of the main variables affecting GHG's emissions, the CCS-fNRB-LPG scenario remains the most effective and the high LPG penetration scenario remains the most unfavorable. The study helped to identify 200 high-priority municipalities (8% of total) located in the Center-South of Mexico encompassing 30% national FW consumption, 31% total FW users, and 55% of total GHG mitigation. In these high-priority counties a win-win policy in terms of social, health and environmental objectives may be achieved in the short-term, improving the efficacy of public policies related to GHG mitigation, universal access to clean energy, and sustainable development. © 2018 The Author(s).

The main purpose of this study is to provide a more in-depth analysis of the determinants of REC from an urban-rural segregation perspective, and quantify the contributions of individual determinants to the regional disparities of REC. Based on the extended STIRPAT (the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology) model, seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimation is employed to examine the impacts of various determinants of urban REC per capita (URECP) and rural REC per capita (RRECP) in a sample of China’s 30 provinces over the period 2007–2016. Then, following the results of SUR, this paper tries to explore the reasons for interprovincial disparities of URECP and RRECP by using the Shapley value decomposition. The empirical results show that income level and heating lead to an increase in URECP, while other factors, including the share of natural gas, average temperature, child dependency ratio and gross dependency ratio, significantly decrease URECP. In terms of RRECP, it is shown that old-age dependency ratio, income level and the share of coal consumption positively influence RRECP, while average temperature has a negative effect on RRECP. Specially, the effect of gross dependency ratio on RRECP is positive, indicating the non-working-age population causes more energy use than the working-age population in rural areas. According to the Shapley decomposition, rather than social-economic variables, climate and heating factors contribute the most to the interprovincial differences in URECP. Furthermore, it is found that income level is the most important factor accounting for inter-provincial differences in RRECP. The findings of this research are of great interest, not only to scholars in REC-related fields, but also to decision makers. © 2018, MDPI AG.

CO is a colorless, odorless, and poisonous gas that produces various acute and chronic effects in CO-exposed people. In this study, we aimed to measure CO levels in auto care repairmen with chronic CO-related illnesses using a serial, non-invasive method. A prospective cohort study. Methods: A total of 99 people from six different auto-repair services were included in the study. Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels were measured at four different times with 2-hour intervals starting at 08:00 AM. Data concerning employees' ages, working hours, smoking statuses, and types of home heating fuel were collected. A control group of 100 cases was created based on this data. The measurements were done on the control group in the morning with a Masimo Rad-57 CO-oximeter. Results: The highest mean (± SD) COHb value was 7.04% ± 3.32% after the third measurement. The mean value for the control group was 1.61% ± 1.43%. A statistically significant difference between the groups was found for each value. Discussion: We determined that the risk of being affected by CO is high in buildings in which the auto services were located. The effects of chronic or prolonged exposure to low amounts of CO were found to be ambiguous. However, in some studies, it was found that low-grade CO exposure could lead to coronary artery disease and some neurological complications. Therefore, it is necessary to be careful about the health of employees who have been exposed to CO. Conclusions: We concluded that there is a need for more detailed studies concerning chronic CO poisoning.

Objective: To evaluate the influence of indoor air pollution on the natural history of asthma. Methods: Data collection by using the European Community Respiratory Health Survey and International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood standardized questionnaire (N 18,617) and medical examinations (N 4783) in selected Polish regions was used. Statistical analysis was performed by using the 2 test. A value of p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Questionnaire results demonstrated that people who used the central heating system were less likely to declare the occurrence of asthma (odds ratio [OR] 0.84) and were corroborated with clinical findings of moderate asthma (OR 0.35). Symptomatic asthma occurred more frequently in people who used a solid-fuel heating device (OR 1.36) and electric heaters (OR 1.54). The use of cooking appliances with municipal natural gas (OR 1.77) and gas storage tanks (OR 2.03) was correlated with more frequent declarations of asthma. Symptomatic asthma was more common among people who smoked for at least 1 year (OR 2.26) and those who smoked over the course of the preceding month (OR 1.60). Passive exposure to tobacco smoke provided for a 1.5-fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic asthma (OR 1.53), regardless of the time of exposure. Conclusion: Both active and passive tobacco smoke exposure as well as the use of certain types of heating and cooking appliances have a significant impact on the incidence of asthma and the intensification of its symptoms in rooms with limited air exchange. Highlights of the study included the following: (1) central heating had an amelioratory effect on asthma, (2) heating technologies used at home had a significant impact on the incidence of asthma, and (3) devices used for cooking (municipal and cylinder gas stoves) played an important role in the intensification of asthma symptoms.

Rather than building infrastructure to recover low volumes of this natural gas, the industry flares or vents it to the atmosphere, which contributes to atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions but also reduces the air quality locally because it contains gaseous sulphur and nitrogen compounds. Converting the natural gas (NG) to hydrocarbons with a small-scale two-step gas-to-liquids process, is an alternative to flaring and venting. In the first step, NG reacts with oxygen to form syngas (Catalytic Partial Oxidation) and in the second step the syngas reacts over metallic catalysts to form higher paraffins at 210 °C to 300 °C—Fischer Tropsch synthesis (FT). For the first time, we synthesize bimetallic FeCo FT catalysts with ultrasound. An ultrasonic horn agitates the solution during the entire impregnation process. The active phase dispersion of the sonicated catalysts was superior to the catalyst synthesized without ultrasound, while reducing the impregnation time by a factor of three. We tested our catalysts in a lab-scale, fixed-bed reactor at 270 °C and 300 °C, and achieved 80% conversion over 3-days on stream and a 40% yield of C2+. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Catalyst synthesis; FeCo; Fischer-Tropsch; Impregnation; Iron; Sonocatalysis; Ultrasound,Air quality; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical reactors; Cobalt alloys; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Impregnation; Iron; Iron alloys; Natural gas; Nitrogen compounds; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Sulfur compounds; Synthesis gas; Ultrasonics; Atmospheric greenhouse; Catalyst synthesis; Catalytic partial oxidation; FeCo; Fischer Tropsch; Fischer-Tropsch catalysts; Gas-to-liquids process; Sonocatalysis; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; hydrocarbon; natural gas; nitrogen; nitrogen derivative; oxygen; petroleum; sulfur derivative; adsorption; air quality; Article; carbon footprint; catalysis; catalyst; controlled study; desorption; high temperature; oxidation; particle size; priority journal; quantum yield; surface area; synthesis; ultrasound,"Boffito, D.C.; Department of Chemical Engineering, 2500, chemin de Polytechnique, Canada; эл. почта: daria-camilla.boffito@polymtl.ca",,Elsevier B.V.,13504177,,ULSOE,30080581.0,English,Ultrason.

Smart thermostats are also one of the most important products of home automation system. HVAC systems account for over 60% of the energy consumed by buildings and this rate is expected to increase further in the future. For this reason, it is important to pay attention to the efficient use of HVAC systems. In this study, three different studies were performed on how much energy could be saved by using smart thermostats. When the temperature can be reduced during the night hours while consumers are sleeping, the energy savings for electricity and natural gas consumption were calculated as 20.72% and 17.7%, respectively. When consumers are away from the house at specific hours, they can save average 35.41% and 10.28% percent on electricity and natural gas consumption, respectively by turning down the thermostat or turning it off completely. © 2018 IEEE.",Energy Efficiency; Energy Savings; Home Automation Systems; Smart Thermostats,Access control; Automation; Climate control; Doors; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Enterprise resource planning; Natural gas; Thermostats; Control device; Home automation; Home automation systems; HVAC system; Natural gas consumption; Smart switch; HVAC,,Engin S.N.Arisoy D.O.Oz M.A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781538676417,,,English,"Int.

On the other hand, fossil fuels cause air pollution, global warming and similar environmental problems. Therefore, recent studies have become widespread about renewable energy sources (RESs) such as biomass, hydropower, geothermal, wind and solar which are the most popular in the worldwide. Among other RESs, solar energy is assumed as the best alternative to fossil sources. The photovoltaic (PV) systems generate electricity by using solar energy. In this study, a micro inverter is designed by using flyback converter on dc-dc side and neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter for dc-ac conversion. The power capacity of designed micro inverter is rated at 345 W where the input voltage is 62 V while output voltage is converted to 220 Vrms at 50 Hz frequency. Two different controllers are used against changing irradiation conditions in this work. The flyback converter is controlled by a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) while a proportional integral (PI) controller controls the NPC inverter. The designed micro inverter presents 0.57% total harmonic distortion (THD) ratio of voltage and current in FFT spectrum. © 2018 IEEE.",Flyback converter; Micro inverter; NPC inverter; Renewable energy,Controllers; DC-DC converters; Electromagnetic wave emission; Fossil fuels; Geothermal energy; Global warming; Maximum power point trackers; Natural gasoline plants; Proven reserves; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Two term control systems; Flyback converters; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Micro inverters; Neutral point clamped inverters; NPC inverters; Proportional integral controllers; Renewable energies; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Electric inverters,,Engin S.N.Arisoy D.O.Oz M.A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781538676417,,,English,"Int.

Different GHGs are often conflated into a single metric to compare technologies and supply chains, such as the global warming potential (GWP). However, the use of GWP is criticised, regarding: (1) the need to select a timeframe; (2) its physical basis on radiative forcing; and (3) the fact that it measures the average forcing of a pulse over time rather than a sustained emission at a specific end-point in time. Many alternative metrics have been proposed which tackle different aspects of these limitations and this paper assesses them by their key attributes and limitations, with respect to methane emissions. A case study application of various metrics is produced and recommendations are made for the use of climate metrics for different categories of applications. Across metrics, CO2 equivalences for methane range from 4-199 gCO2eq./gCH4, although most estimates fall between 20 and 80 gCO2eq./gCH4. Therefore the selection of metric and time horizon for technology evaluations is likely to change the rank order of preference, as demonstrated herein with the use of natural gas as a shipping fuel versus alternatives. It is not advisable or conservative to use only a short time horizon, e.g. 20 years, which disregards the long-term impacts of CO2 emissions and is thus detrimental to achieving eventual climate stabilisation. Recommendations are made for the use of metrics in 3 categories of applications. Short-term emissions estimates of facilities or regions should be transparent and use a single metric and include the separated contribution from each GHG. Multi-year technology assessments should use both short and long term static metrics (e.g. GWP) to test robustness of results. Longer term energy assessments or decarbonisation pathways must use both short and long-term metrics and where this has a large impact on results, climate models should be incorporated. Dynamic metrics offer insight into the timing of emissions, but may be of only marginal benefit given uncertainties in methodological assumptions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,carbon dioxide; methane; natural gas; Article; atmosphere; climate change; cost; economic model; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; global change; global climate; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; heat; human; precipitation; priority journal; radiative forcing; sea level rise; species extinction; time; weather; algorithm; climate; comparative study; greenhouse effect; Algorithms; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Natural Gas,"Balcombe, P.; Sustainable Gas Institute, United Kingdom; эл. почта: p.balcombe@imperial.ac.uk",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,30255177.0,English,Environ.

Factors associated with phantom odor perception have not been reported using population-based epidemiologic data. OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of phantom odor perception among US adults 40 years and older and identify factors associated with this condition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study with complex sampling design, 7417 adults 40 years and older made up a nationally representative sample from data collected in 2011 through 2014 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. EXPOSURES Sociodemographic characteristics, cigarette and alcohol use, head injury, persistent dry mouth, smell function, and general health status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Phantom odor perception ascertained as report of unpleasant, bad, or burning odor when no actual odor exists. RESULTS Of the 7417 participants in the study, 52.8% (3862) were women, the mean (SD) age was 58 (12) years, and the prevalence of phantom odor perception occurred in 534 participants, which was 6.5% of the population (95% CI, 5.7%-7.5%). Phantom odor prevalence varied considerably by age and sex. Women 60 years and older reported phantom odors less commonly (7.5% [n = 935] and 5.5% [n = 937] among women aged 60-69 years and 70 years and older, respectively) than younger women (9.6% [n = 1028] and 10.1% [n = 962] among those aged 40-49 years and 50-59 years, respectively). The prevalence among men varied from 2.5% (n = 846) among men 70 years and older to 5.3% (n = 913) among men 60 to 69 years old. Phantom odor perception was 60% (n = 1602) to 65% (n = 2521) more likely among those with an income-to-poverty ratio of less than 3 compared with those in the highest income-to-poverty ratio group (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% CI, 1.06-2.56; and OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.01-2.54 for income-to-poverty ratio <1.5 and 1.5-2.9, respectively). Health conditions associated with phantom odor perception included persistent dry mouth (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.17-4.24) and history of head injury (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.20-2.51). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An age-related decline in the prevalence of phantom odor perception is observed in women but not in men. Only 11% (n = 64) of people who report phantom odor perception have discussed a taste or smell problem with a clinician. Associations of phantom odor perception with poorer health and persistent dry mouth point to medication use as a potential explanation. Prevention of serious head injuries could have the added benefit of reducing phantom odor perception. © 2018 American Medical Association.

Systematic studies of CO2/CH4 separation over a wide range of temperatures from 65 °C (338 K) to as low as −40 °C (233 K) reveals a favorable separation mechanism toward CO2 by incorporating Y-fum-fcu-MOF as a filler in a 6FDA-DAM polyimide membrane. Notably, the decrease of the temperature from 308 K down to 233 K affords an extremely high CO2/CH4 selectivity (≈130) for the hybrid Y-fum-fcu-MOF/6FDA-DAM membrane, about four-fold enhancement, with an associated CO2 permeability above 1000 barrers. At subambient temperatures, the pronounced CO2/CH4 diffusion selectivity dominates the high permeation selectivity, and the enhanced CO2 solubility promotes high CO2 permeability. The differences in adsorption enthalpy and activation enthalpy for diffusion between CO2 and CH4 produce the observed favorable CO2 permeation versus CH4.

The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (in General Comment 15, drafted 2002) argued that access to water was a condition for the enjoyment of the right to an adequate standard of living, inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of health, and thus a human right. On 28 July 2010 the United Nations General Assembly declared safe and clean drinking water and sanitation a human right essential to the full enjoyment of life and all other human rights. This paper charts the international legal development of the right to water and its relevance to discussions surrounding the growth of unconventional energy and its heavy reliance on water. We consider key data from the country with arguably the most mature and extensive industry, the USA, and highlight the implications for water usage and water rights. We conclude that, given the weight of testimony of local people from our research, along with data from scientific literature, non-governmental organization (NGO) and other policy reports, that the right to water for residents living near fracking sites is likely to be severely curtailed. Even so, from the data presented here, we argue that the major issue regarding water use is the shifting of the resource from society to industry and the demonstrable lack of supply-side price signal that would demand that the industry reduce or stabilize its water demand per unit of energy produced. Thus, in the US context alone, there is considerable evidence that the human right to water will be seriously undermined by the growth of the unconventional oil and gas industry, and given its spread around the globe this could soon become a global human rights issue. © 2018 by the authors.

Using detailed location data on maternal addresses and GIS coordinates of gas wells, this study examines singleton births to mothers residing close to a shale gas well from 2003 to 2010 in Pennsylvania. The introduction of drilling increased low birth weight and decreased term birth weight on average among mothers living within 2.5 km of a well compared to mothers living within 2.5 km of a permitted well. Adverse effects were also detected using measures such as small for gestational age and APGAR scores, while no effects on gestation periods were found. In the intensive margin, an additional well is associated with a 7 percent increase in low birth weight, a 5 g reduction in term birth weight and a 3 percent increase in premature birth. These results are robust to other measures of infant health, many changes in specification and falsification tests. These findings suggest that shale gas development poses significant risks to human health. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Air pollution; Infant health; Low birth weight; Shale gas development; Water pollution,"atmospheric pollution; child health; gas production; health risk; risk factor; shale gas; water pollution; air pollution; Apgar score; Article; birth weight; child health; controlled study; economic aspect; environmental monitoring; epidemiological monitoring; evidence based medicine; female; gas field; geographic distribution; gestation period; global positioning system; hazard assessment; health hazard; health literacy; human; infant; male; mother child relation; Pennsylvania; quasi experimental study; small for date infant; social status; water pollution; adverse event; drug effect; epidemiology; gestational age; low birth weight; oil and gas field; oil industry; Pennsylvania; prematurity; Pennsylvania; United States; natural gas; Air Pollution; Apgar Score; Birth Weight; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant Health; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Premature; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Male; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Oil and Gas Industry; Pennsylvania; Water Pollution",,,Elsevier B.V.,01676296,,JHECD,30114565.0,English,J.

Few studies have been conducted to explore the potential health impacts of CSG development on children and adolescents. This analysis presents age-specific hospitalisation rates for a child and adolescent cohort in three study areas in Queensland. Methods Three geographic areas were selected: a CSG area, a coal mining area, and a rural area with no mining activity. Changes in area-specific hospital admissions were investigated over the period 1995–2011 in a series of negative binomial regression analyses for 19 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) chapters, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Results The strongest associations were found for respiratory diseases in 0–4 year olds (7% increase [95% CI 4%, 11%] and 6% increase [95% CI 2%, 10%] in the CSG area relative to the coal mining and rural areas, respectively) and 10–14 year olds (9% increase [95% CI 1%, 18%] and 11% increase [95% CI 1%, 21%] in the CSG area compared to the coal mining and rural areas, respectively). The largest effect size was for blood/immune diseases in 5–9 year olds in the CSG area (467% increase [95% CI 139%, 1244%]) compared to the rural area with no mining activity. Conclusions for Practice Higher rates of hospitalisation existed in the CSG area for certain ICD chapters and paediatric age groups, suggesting potential age-specific health impacts. This study provides insights on associations that should be explored further in terms of child and adolescent health. © 2018, The Author(s).",Adolescents; Children; Coal seam gas; Queensland; Unconventional natural gas,"natural gas; adolescent; Australia; child; coal mining; environmental exposure; epidemiology; female; hospitalization; human; infant; male; newborn; oil and gas field; preschool child; Queensland; rural population; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adolescent; Australia; Child; Child, Preschool; Coal Industry; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Queensland; Rural Population; Young Adult","Werner, A.K.; Level 6, Corner Staffhouse and College Roads, Sir James Foots Bldg (47a), Australia; эл. почта: angela.k.werner@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,10927875,,,29500783.0,English,Matern.

While theoretical frameworks like construal-level theory and the ""Not in My Backyard"" (or NIMBY) moniker provide insight into these spatial dynamics, case studies in specific locations experiencing energy development reveal substantial variation in community responses. Larger-scale studies exploring the link between proximity and support have been hampered by data quality and availability. We draw on a unique data set that includes geo-coded data from national surveys (nine waves; n = 19,098) and high-resolution well location data to explore the relationship between proximity and both familiarity with and support for hydraulic fracturing. We use two different measures of proximity-respondent distance to the nearest well and the density of wells within a certain radius of the respondent's location. We find that both types of proximity to new development are linked to more familiarity with hydraulic fracturing, even after controlling for various individual and contextual factors, but only distance-based proximity is linked to more support for the practice. When significant, these relationships are similar to or exceed the effects of race, income, gender, and age. We discuss the implications of these findings for effective risk communication as well as the importance of incorporating spatial analysis into public opinion research on perceptions of energy development. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis.",Fracking; geographic proximity; hydraulic fracturing; public opinion; unconventional oil and gas,article; female; fracking; gender; human; major clinical study; male; perception; public opinion; race; spatial analysis,,,NLM (Medline),15396924,,,29637576.0,English,Risk Anal.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045213074

When applied to exposure science, Sutton’s Law would argue that the major emphasis should be on techniques that directly measure exposure in or close to the human, animal or ecosystem receptors of concern. Exposure science largely and appropriately violates Sutton’s Law by estimating exposure based on information on emissions or measurements obtained at a distance from the receptors of concern. I suggest four criteria to help determine whether Sutton’s law should be violated for an innovative technology, and explore these criteria in relation to potential human exposure resulting from unconventional gas drilling (UGD): (1) The technological processes possibly leading to release of the chemical or physical agents of concern are reasonably understood; (2) the agents of concern are known; (3) the source and geographical location of the releases can be reasonably identified; and (4) there is information about the likely temporal pattern of the releases and resulting pollutant levels in relation to the temporal patterns of receptor susceptibility. For UGD, the complexity of the technology including many possible release points at different time periods; the existence of three variable mixtures of chemical and physical agents as well as possible unknown reactants; the demonstrated large variation in releases from site to site; and deficiencies in transparency and regulatory oversight, all suggest that studies of the potential health impact of UGD should follow Sutton’s Law. This includes the use of techniques that more directly measure exposure close to or within the receptors of concern, such as biological markers or through community-based citizen science. Understanding the implications of Sutton’s Law could help focus scientific and regulatory efforts on effective approaches to evaluate the potential health and ecosystem implications of new and evolving technologies. © 2017, The Author(s).",Biomonitoring; Criteria pollutants; Emerging contaminants; Inhalation exposure; Personal exposure; Volatile organic compounds,natural gas; analysis; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; human; oil industry; pollutant; procedures; risk assessment; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Industry; Risk Assessment,"Goldstein, B.D.; University of Pittsburgh—Environmental and Occupational Health, 130 DeSoto Street A710 Crabtree Hall, United States; эл. почта: bdgold@pitt.edu",,Nature Publishing Group,15590631,,,29302044.0,English,J.

We report that graphene-confined single Fe atoms can be used as an efficient non-precious catalyst to directly convert methane to C1 oxygenated products at room temperature. A series of graphene-confined 3d transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) were screened, yet only single Fe atoms could catalyze the methane conversion. Combining in operando time-of-flight mass spectrometry, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and density functional theory calculations, we found that methane conversion proceeds on the O–FeN4–O active site along a radical pathway to produce CH3OH and CH3OOH first, and then the generated CH3OH can be further catalyzed to form HOCH2OOH and HCOOH at room temperature. Methane from natural gas and shale gas is one of the most promising feedstocks because of its high reserves and low price. The selective activation and orientable conversion of methane are considered the “holy grail” in catalysis. Because of the highly stable C–H bond, methane conversion usually requires high temperatures to overcome the high reaction barrier. However, the high-temperature reaction is not favorable for industrial application. Despite many efforts to decrease the reaction temperature, it remains a great challenge to promote methane conversion under mild conditions, especially at room temperature. Herein, we report that graphene-confined single Fe atoms can be used as an efficient non-precious catalyst to directly convert methane to high-value-added C1 oxygenated products at room temperature (25°C), which provides a new route to understanding and designing highly efficient non-precious catalysts for methane conversion at room temperature. Graphene-confined single Fe atoms, screened out from a series of 3d transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu), were used as an efficient non-precious catalyst to directly convert methane to C1 oxygenated products at room temperature. The unique O–FeN4–O structure formed in graphene can readily activate the C–H bond of methane along a radical pathway with a low reaction energy barrier. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",graphene; methane conversion; non-precious-metal catalyst; room-temperature reaction; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy; single iron atoms,,"Deng, D.; State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, China; эл. почта: dhdeng@dicp.ac.cn",,Elsevier Inc,24519308,,CHEMV,,English,Chem,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048567839

Here we measured physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition of sediment samples taken from twenty-eight streams within the Marcellus shale formation in northeastern Pennsylvania differentially impacted by hydraulic fracturing activities. Fourteen of the streams were classified as UOG+, and thirteen were classified as UOG- based on the presence of UOG extraction in their respective watersheds. One stream was located in a watershed that previously had UOG extraction activities but was recently abandoned. We utilized high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to infer differences in sediment aquatic bacterial community structure between UOG+ and UOG- streams, as well as correlate bacterial community structure to physicochemical water parameters. Although overall alpha and beta diversity differences were not observed, there were a plethora of significantly enriched operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within UOG+ and UOG- samples. Our biomarker analysis revealed many of the bacterial taxa enriched in UOG+ streams can live in saline conditions, such as Rubrobacteraceae. In addition, several bacterial taxa capable of hydrocarbon degradation were also enriched in UOG+ samples, including Oceanospirillaceae. Methanotrophic taxa, such as Methylococcales, were significantly enriched as well. Several taxa that were identified as enriched in these samples were enriched in samples taken from different streams in 2014; moreover, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed clustering between streams from the different studies based on the presence of hydraulic fracturing along the second axis. This study revealed significant differences between bacterial assemblages within stream sediments of UOG+ and UOG- streams and identified several potential biomarkers for evaluating and monitoring the response of autochthonous bacterial communities to potential hydraulic fracturing impacts. © 2018 Chen See, Ulrich, Nwanosike, McLimans, Tokarev, Wright, Campa, Grant, Hazen, Niles, Ressler and Lamendella.",16S rRNA gene sequencing; Biomarkers; Fracking; Halophilic; Hydraulic fracturing; Hydrocarbons; Marcellus shale; Microbial communities,biological marker; Article; bioinformatics; conductance; controlled study; DNA extraction; ecological genetics; Flammeovirgaceae; Leptospirillaceae; metagenome; Methanobacteriaceae; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; Rubrobacteraceae; Shewanellaceae; spatiotemporal analysis; species richness; taxonomy; water quality,"Lamendella, R.; Department of Biology, United States; эл. почта: lamendella@juniata.edu",,Frontiers Media S.A.,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

The sector is forecast to potentially eclipse industry in this regard if conventional vehicle choices and travel modes persist. This paper explores scenarios of transport technology choices and demand in a future of uncertain fuel and technology costs, and the consequences for energy supply and greenhouse gas emissions. It explores the extent of electric vehicle (EV) adoption and the implication of fuel migration from petroleum products. The preference for alternative fuels such as hydrogen, liquid biofuels and natural gas is also investigated. The evolution of road transport in South Africa towards 2050 is investigated utilising the South African TIMES model, a full energy sector least-cost optimisation model that relies on a rich technological database of the entire energy supply and demand system. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are shown to be a viable option in freight and public transport, potentially meeting 70% of travel demand by 2045. The private passenger and light commercial sectors emerge as the main market for electric vehicles, potentially accounting for 80% of new vehicle sales by 2045. Electricity as a transport fuel could account for 30% of fuel supply and reduce transport emissions to half of present day estimates. However, the key uncertainty driving EV adoption is future vehicle costs and crude oil prices, which could dampen EV uptake. Another main finding is that petroleum-dependent vehicles remain an important vehicle class, and that re-investment in existing crude oil refineries to conform to Euro5 standards is a likely requirement. There seems to be little indication, however, that additional refining capacity would be economically viable within the planning horizon. © 2018 Energy Research Centre, University of Cape Town.",Electric vehicles; Energy; GHG emissions; Hydrogen; Modelling,,"Ahjum, F.; Energy Research Centre, Private Bag X3, South Africa; эл. почта: mf.ahjum@uct.ac.za",,Korean Association for the Study of Intestinal Diseases,15989100,,,,English,Intest.

Risk assessment is a useful tool for designing effective strategies for preventing and controlling these accidents. Conventional risk assessment methods have major deficiencies, including uncertainty in the obtained results and the completely static nature, therefore, the present study is aimed at applying a dynamic and quantitative approach to assess the safety risks of city natural gas pressure regulating stations. Methods: First, according to the standard of the Total Company (GS EP SAF 253), the reference (credible) event scenario was determined, then a qualitative, quantitative and dynamic modeling of the cause-consequence accident scenario model using Bayesian Network (BN) is provided and next, deductive and abductive probabilistic reasoning are conducted by means of constructed BN model. PHAST 7.11 program is employed to modeled and evaluated of different consequences of the scenario. Finally, the risk of accident scenario consequences was calculated, evaluated and updated. Results: 43 root events in occurrence of the credible event scenario of the gas stations were identified. Among the identified causes, the human failures (85%), process failures (10%) and mechanical failures (5%) had the highest contributing to occurrence in the accident scenario, respectively. Occurrence probability of the scenario is determined 7.11 ×10-2. Safety barriers, especially emergency shutdown valves (ESD), had a significant role in reducing the consequences severity. The risk of all three of consequences including jet fire, flash fire and vapor cloud explosion is located in unacceptable area. Conclusion: The use of BNs provides a comprehensive qualitative, quantitative and dynamic graphical modeling of the accident scenario. The abductive reasoning ability of these networks is capable to reducing the uncertainty and updating the probability of occurrence of root events and final the consequences. Using BNs along with consequences modeling, leads to a slightly more dynamic, precise and practical risk assessment in process plants. © 2018 Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Health Services.

Simultaneously, its power consumption is projected to increase more than double by 2020. Currently, the dependence on coal is relatively high, making it the largest global greenhouse gas emitting sector which is a matter of great concern. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the environmental impacts of the natural gas electricity generation in India and propose a model using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Design/methodology/approach: LCA is used as a tool to evaluate the environmental impact of the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant, as it adopts a holistic approach towards the whole process. The LCA methodology used in this study follows the ISO 14040 and 14044 standards (ISO 14040: 2009; ISO 14044: 2009). A questionnaire was designed for data collection and validated by expert review primary data for the annual environmental emission was collected by personally visiting the power plant. The study follows a cradle to gate assessment using the CML (2001) methodology. Findings: The analysis reveals that the main impacts were during the process of combustion. The Global warming potential is approximately 0.50 kg CO2 equivalents per kWh of electricity generation from this gas-based power plant. These results can be used by stakeholders, experts and members who are authorised to probe positive initiative for the reduction of environmental impacts from the power generation sector. Practical implications: Considering the pace of growth of economic development of India, it is the need of the hour to emphasise on the patterns of sustainable energy generation which is an important subject to be addressed considering India’s ratification to the Paris Climate Change Agreement. This paper analyzes the environmental impacts of gas-based electricity generation. Originality/value: Presenting this case study is an opportunity to get a glimpse of the challenges associated with gas-based electricity generation in India. It gives a direction and helps us to better understand the right spot which require efforts for the improvement of sustainable energy generation processes, by taking appropriate measures for emission reduction. This paper also proposes a model for gas-based electricity generation in India. It has been developed following an LCA approach. As far as we aware, this is the first study which proposes an LCA model for gas-based electricity generation in India. The model is developed in line with the LCA methodology and focusses on the impact categories specific for gas-based electricity generation. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Electricity; Environmental impacts; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle assessment; Natural gas,electricity generation; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; holistic approach; life cycle analysis; natural gas; sustainability; India,"Shah, B.; Centre for Environmental Studies, India; эл. почта: BINITAUMWELT@GMAIL.COM",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,14777835,,,,English,Manage.

The OBV framework, developed for U.S. offices, considers six outcomes of increasing ventilation: profitable outcomes realized from improvements in occupant work performance and sick leave absenteeism; health outcomes from occupant exposure to outdoor fine particles and ozone; and energy outcomes from electricity and natural gas usage. We used the literature to set low, medium, and high reference values for OBV loss function parameters, and evaluated the framework and outcome-based ventilation rates using a simulated U.S. office stock dataset and a case study in New York City. With parameters for all outcomes set at medium values derived from literature-based central estimates, higher ventilation rates’ profitable benefits dominated negative health and energy impacts, and the OBV framework suggested ventilation should be ≥45 L/s/occ, much higher than the baseline ~8.5 L/s/occ rate prescribed by ASHRAE 62.1. Only when combining very low parameter estimates for profitable impacts with very high ones for health and energy impacts were all outcomes on the same order.

There, at 3 km deep, the rich Groningen gas field extends over 900 km2 and still contains about 600 of the original 2,800 billion cubic meters (bcm). Particularly after 2001, earthquakes have increased in number, magnitude (M, on the logarithmic Richter scale), and damage to numerous buildings. The man-made nature of extraction-induced earthquakes challenges static notions of risk, complicates formal risk assessment, and questions familiar conceptions of acceptable risk. Here, a 26-year set of 294 earthquakes with M ≥ 1.5 is statistically analyzed in relation to increasing cumulative gas extraction since 1963. Extrapolations from a fast-rising trend over 2001–2013 indicate that—under “business as usual”—around 2021 some 35 earthquakes with M ≥ 1.5 might occur annually, including four with M ≥ 2.5 (ten-fold stronger), and one with M ≥ 3.5 every 2.5 years. Given this uneasy prospect, annual gas extraction has been reduced from 54 bcm in 2013 to 24 bcm in 2017. This has significantly reduced earthquake activity, so far. However, when extraction is stabilized at 24 bcm per year for 2017–2021 (or 21.6 bcm, as judicially established in Nov. 2017), the annual number of earthquakes would gradually increase again, with an expected all-time maximum M ≈ 4.5. Further safety management may best follow distinct stages of seismic risk generation, with moderation of gas extraction and massive (but late and slow) building reinforcement as outstanding strategies. Officially, “acceptable risk” is mainly approached by quantification of risk (e.g., of fatal building collapse) for testing against national safety standards, but actual (local) risk estimation remains problematic. Additionally important are societal cost–benefit analysis, equity considerations, and precautionary restraint. Socially and psychologically, deliberate attempts are made to improve risk communication, reduce public anxiety, and restore people's confidence in responsible experts and policymakers. © 2018 The Authors Risk Analysis published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Risk Analysis.",Acceptable risk; earthquake safety; gas extraction; Groningen field; induced seismicity,Cost benefit analysis; Extraction; Gas industry; Gases; Induced Seismicity; Natural gas fields; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Safety testing; Billion cubic meters; Business-as-usual; Earthquake activity; Earthquake safety; Gas extractions; Groningen field; Risk communication; Safety management; Earthquakes; building; detection method; earthquake; earthquake damage; earthquake magnitude; extraction method; gas field; induced seismicity; long-term change; risk assessment; safety; statistical analysis; Groningen [Netherlands]; Netherlands; adult; anxiety; article; conception; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; earthquake; extraction; gas field; human; male; Netherlands; prognosis; reinforcement; risk assessment; structure collapse,"Vlek, C.; University of Groningen, Grote Kruisstraat 2/I, Netherlands; эл. почта: c.a.j.vlek@rug.nl",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,02724332,,RIAND,29341236.0,English,Risk Anal.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040745479

An extensive research literature discusses the adverse impact of these trends on worker health and safety. Research has shown that economic pressures leading to unsafe practices by contractors, hazardous forms of disorganization in contracting chains and regulatory failure contribute to adverse health and safety outcomes for workers. Less research has addressed the impact of sub-contracting chains on the potential for complex catastrophic incidents in which the public could be impacted. We contribute to a growing body of work on this subject by examining excavation work around high pressure natural gas pipelines in Australia. We draw on past research complemented with concepts from the economics literature to highlight the impact of ‘risk shifting’ as contractors seek to cope with financial pressure in highly competitive sectors. Contract terms incentivize contractors to work as quickly as possible while also prioritizing compliance with safety-related rules. Using qualitative data from 36 face-to-face interviews we discuss the way that supply chains characterized by these types of contracts can lead to situations where the pressure to work quickly means that contractors might trade off safe work practices in order to meet project deadlines and make a profit. We argue that in times of acute financial pressure, safety can become fungible with an associated increase in risk to the public. The findings of this research may have broader implications for other public risk situations in sectors with similar structures and organizational arrangements. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Disorganization; Multi-tier supply chains; Organizational safety; Risk shifting; Safety rules,Contractors; Economic and social effects; Finance; Natural gas pipelines; Safety engineering; Supply chains; Disorganization; Multi-tier; Organizational safety; Risk shifting; Safety rules; Occupational risks; Article; Australia; case study; conceptual framework; construction worker; contract; cost control; financial management; health care access; human; occupational hazard; occupational safety; priority journal; qualitative research; risk assessment; risk factor,"McDermott, V.; The Centre for Construction Work Health and Safety Research, City Campus, 360 Swanson Street (Bldg 8, Level 8), Australia; эл. почта: vanessa.mcdermott@rmit.edu.au",,Elsevier B.V.,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

Methane-oxidising bacteria, methanotrophs, are crucial in mitigating emissions of methane as they oxidise most of the methane produced in soils and the subsurface before it reaches the atmosphere. Methanotrophs are usually obligate, i.e. grow only on methane and not on longer chain alkanes. Bacteria that grow on the other gaseous alkanes in natural gas such as propane have also been characterised, but they do not grow on methane. Recently, it was shown that the facultative methanotroph Methylocella silvestris grew on ethane and propane, other components of natural gas, in addition to methane. Therefore, we hypothesised that Methylocella may be prevalent at natural gas seeps and might play a major role in consuming all components of this potent greenhouse gas mixture before it is released to the atmosphere. Results: Environments known to be exposed to biogenic methane emissions or thermogenic natural gas seeps were surveyed for methanotrophs. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that Methylocella were the most abundant methanotrophs in natural gas seep environments. New Methylocella-specific molecular tools targeting mmoX (encoding the soluble methane monooxygenase) by PCR and Illumina amplicon sequencing were designed and used to investigate various sites. Functional gene-based assays confirmed that Methylocella were present in all of the natural gas seep sites tested here. This might be due to its ability to use methane and other short chain alkane components of natural gas. We also observed the abundance of Methylocella in other environments exposed to biogenic methane, suggesting that Methylocella has been overlooked in the past as previous ecological studies of methanotrophs often used pmoA (encoding the alpha subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase) as a marker gene. Conclusion: New biomolecular tools designed in this study have expanded our ability to detect, and our knowledge of the environmental distribution of Methylocella, a unique facultative methanotroph. This study has revealed that Methylocella are particularly abundant at natural gas seeps and may play a significant role in biogeochemical cycling of gaseous hydrocarbons. © 2018 The Author(s).",Biological methane; Facultative methanotrophs; Geological methane; Methane monooxygenase; Methylocella; mmoX; Natural gas,"ethane; genomic DNA; hydrocarbon; methane; methane monooxygenase; natural gas; propane; RNA 16S; water; methane monooxygenase; natural gas; oxygenase; RNA 16S; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; bacterial growth; Bacteroidetes; Betaproteobacteria; Campylobacteraceae; Chloroflexi; Comamonadaceae; controlled study; DNA extraction; Firmicutes; Flavobacteriaceae; Gammaproteobacteria; gas chromatography; gene sequence; greenhouse gas; Hyphomicrobiaceae; methanotroph; Methylocella; Methylococcus; Methylococcus capsulatus; Methylosinus trichosporium; microbial colonization; nonhuman; phylogeny; Planctomycetes; polymerase chain reaction; Porphyromonadaceae; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; sediment; sequence analysis; soil; Verrucomicrobia; Beijerinckiaceae; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; nucleotide sequence; Base Sequence; Beijerinckiaceae; Methane; Natural Gas; Oxygenases; Phylogeny; Propane; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology","Murrell, J.C.; University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, United Kingdom; эл. почта: j.c.murrell@uea.ac.uk",,BioMed Central Ltd.,20492618,,,29954460.0,English,Microbiome,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049214713

In light of this, we set out to study microbial diversity and structure in sediments from four shallow thermokarst lakes in the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. Sediments from one of these lakes (Sukok) emit methane (CH4) of thermogenic origin, as expected for an area with natural gas reserves. However, sediments from a lake 10 km to the North West (Siqlukaq) produce CH4 of biogenic origin. Sukok and Siqlukaq were chosen among the four lakes surveyed to test the hypothesis that active CH4-producing organisms (methanogens) would reflect the distribution of CH4 gas levels in the sediments. We first examined the structure of the little known microbial community inhabiting the thaw bulb of arctic thermokarst lakes near Barrow, AK. Molecular approaches (PCR-DGGE and iTag sequencing) targeting the SSU rRNA gene and rRNA molecule were used to profile diversity, assemblage structure, and identify potentially active members of the microbial assemblages. Overall, the potentially active (rRNA dominant) fraction included taxa that have also been detected in other permafrost environments (e.g., Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, and others). In addition, Siqlukaq sediments were unique compared to the other sites, in that they harbored CH4-cycling organisms (i.e., methanogenic Archaea and methanotrophic Bacteria), as well as bacteria potentially involved in N cycling (e.g., Nitrospirae) whereas Sukok sediments were dominated by taxa typically involved in photosynthesis and biogeochemical sulfur (S) transformations. This study revealed a high degree of archaeal phylogenetic diversity in addition to CH4-producing archaea, which spanned nearly the phylogenetic extent of currently recognized Archaea phyla (e.g., Euryarchaeota, Bathyarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, Woesearchaeota, Pacearchaeota, and others). Together these results shed light on expansive bacterial and archaeal diversity in Arctic thermokarst lakes and suggest important differences in biogeochemical potential in contrasting Arctic thermokarst lake sediment ecosystems. © 2018 Matheus Carnevali, Herbold, Hand, Priscu and Murray.",Alaska; Archaea; Arctic; Diversity; Lake; Methane; Sediments; Thermokarst,methane; Alphaproteobacteria; archaeon; Article; DNA extraction; Gammaproteobacteria; gene amplification; gene library; gene sequence; lake; lake sediment; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; photosynthesis; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription; RNA extraction; sequence alignment,"Murray, A.E.; Division of Earth and Ecosystem Sciences, United States; эл. почта: alison.murray@dri.edu",,Frontiers Media S.A.,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

Little research has examined how community living infrastructure has influenced the establishment of these day care centres in rural communities. The purposes of this study were: (1) explore regional differences in community living infrastructure; and (2) to examine the impact of such infrastructure on the establishment of day care centres for Chinese seniors in rural communities. The data were derived from “The Fourth Sample Survey on the Living Conditions of Elderly People in Urban and Rural China (2015)”. The establishment of at least one day care centre was the outcome of interest, which was dichotomized at the community level into the establishment of at least one day care centre or the absence of any day care centres. Logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the impact of various community living infrastructural characteristics on the establishment of day care centres. The results showed that of the 4522 rural communities surveyed in 2015, only 10.1% had established at least one day care centre. Community living infrastructural characteristics that were significantly associated with the establishment of day care centres were the availability of cement/asphalt roads, natural gas, tap drinking water, sewage systems, and centralized garbage disposal. Our findings suggest that the significant association between community-level characteristics, especially community living infrastructure, and the establishment of rural day care centre for seniors may inform policy decision making. © 2018, MDPI AG.

Thus, it is important to have timely and available information on greenhouse gas emissions generated by the power sector to ensure that the policies implemented achieve intended emissions reductions. This work is the first to develop a transparent method to compute the emissions intensity for the US electricity section from 2001 through 2017 at different temporal (annual, quarterly, monthly) and regional (US, NERC, and state) levels. We find that between 2001 and 2017 the average annual CO2 emissions intensity of electricity production in the United States decreased by 30%, from 630 g CO2 kWh-1 to 439 g CO2 kWh-1. This change in CO2 intensity is attributable to an increase in generation from natural gas and wind accompanied by a reduction in coal-fired power generation. The decline in carbon intensity varies across regions, with the largest reduction between 2001 and 2017 from power plants in the Northeast (58%) and the smallest reduction from power plants in the Texas region (27%). In absolute terms the South-central region saw the largest decrease in emissions intensity (358 g CO2 kWh-1) and Texas saw the smallest (164 g CO2 kWh-1). We also find that replacing coal generation with natural gas or renewables has increased the monthly correlation of CO2 intensity between regions. At the state level, Delaware saw the largest decrease in CO2 intensity (466 g CO2 kWh-1), and Idaho is the only state that has not decreased CO2 intensity since 2001. © 2018 The Author(s).

To account for a key uncertainty in the literature regarding the additional economic impacts of managing variable wind and solar electricity, we built a spatially and temporally detailed power system investment model for South Africa. We find that a mix of wind, solar photovoltaics, and some natural gas is more cost-effective than Inga 3 to meet future demand except in scenarios with pessimistic assumptions about wind technology performance. If a low load growth forecast is used, including Inga 3 in the power mix results in higher system cost across all sensitivities. In our scenarios, the effect of Inga 3 deployment on South African power system cost ranges from an increase of ZAR 4300 (US$ 330) million annually to savings of ZAR 1600 (US$ 120) million annually by 2035. A cost overrun as low as 20% makes the Inga 3 scenarios more expensive in all sensitivity cases. Including time and cost overruns and losses in transmission from DRC to South Africa make Inga 3 an even less attractive investment. For DRC, through analysis of spatial datasets representing technical, physical, and environmental constraints, we find abundant renewable energy potential: 60 GW of solar photovoltaic and 0.6-2.3 GW of wind located close to transmission infrastructure have levelized costs less than US$ 0.07 per kWh, or the anticipated cost of Inga 3 to residential consumers. © 2018 The Author(s).

The results indicate that the expansion of natural gas has caused significant reductions in mortality among both adults and the elderly. These findings are supported by our auxiliary analysis, which demonstrates that the expansion of natural gas networks might have led to a significant improvement in air quality.

Participants prioritized the twelve scenarios based on their potential impact on the health and welfare of the general public, potential impact on worker safety, how well safety guidelines protect against their occurrence, and how frequently they occur. Illegal dumping of flowback water, while rated as the least frequently occurring scenario, was considered the scenario least protected by safety controls and the one of most concern to the general public. In terms of worker safety, the highest concern came from improper or inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE). While safety guidelines appear to be highly protective regarding PPE usage, inadequate PPE is the most directly witnessed failure scenario.

Design: Comparative risk assessment modelling study. Setting, participants: Australian children aged 14 years or less, 2011. Main outcome measures: The population attributable fractions (PAFs) and number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for childhood asthma associated with exposure to damp housing and gas stoves. Results: 26.1% of Australian homes have dampness problems and 38.2% have natural gas as the main energy source for cooktop stoves. The PAF for childhood asthma attributable to damp housing was 7.9% (95% CI, 3.2–12.6%), causing 1760 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; 95% CI, 416–3104 DALYs), or 42 DALYs/100 000 children. The PAF associated with gas stoves was 12.3% (95% CI, 8.9–15.8%), corresponding to 2756 DALYs (95% CI, 1271–4242), or 67 DALYs/100 000 children. If all homes with gas stoves were fitted with high efficiency range hoods to vent gas combustion products outdoors, the PAF and burden estimates were reduced to 3.4% (95% CI, 2.2–4.6%) and 761 DALYs (95% CI, 322–1199). Conclusions: Exposure to damp housing and gas stoves is common in Australia, and is associated with a considerable proportion of the childhood asthma burden.

In this study, a risk assessment of residential exposure pathways to contaminated drinking water is carried out. In this model, it is assumed that a drinking water source is contaminated by a spill of flowback water; probability distributions of spill size and constituent concentrations are fit to historical datasets and Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate a distribution of risk values for two scenarios: (1) use of a contaminated reservoir for residential drinking water supply and (2) swimming in a contaminated pond. The swimming scenario did not produce risks of concern from a single exposure of 1 h duration, but 11 such 1-h exposures did produce risks of 10− 6 due to radionuclide exposure. The drinking water scenario over a 30-year exposure duration produced cancer risk values exceeding 10− 6 for arsenic, benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, pentachlorophenol, and vinyl chloride. However, this extended exposure duration is probably not realistic for exposure by a spill event. Radionuclides produced risks in the residential drinking water scenario of 10− 6 in just 8 h, a much more realistic timeline for continual exposure due to a spill event. In general, for contaminants for which inhalation exposure was applicable, this pathway produced the highest risks with exposure from ingestion posing the next greatest risk to human health followed by dermal absorption (or body emersion for radionuclides). Considering non-carcinogenic effects, only barium and thallium exceed target limits, where the ingestion pathway seems to be of greater concern than dermal exposure. Exposure to radionuclides in flowback water, particularly through the inhalation route, poses a greater threat to human health than other contaminants examined in this assessment and should be the focus of risk assessment and risk mitigation efforts. ©2018 by the authors.

It is viewed as a major source of global energy needs by proponents. Critics consider fracking and UOGE an immediate and long-term threat to global, national, and regional public health and climate. Rarely have governments brought together relatively detailed assessments of direct and indirect public health risks associated with fracking and weighed these against potential benefits to inform a national debate on whether to pursue this energy route. The Scottish government has now done so in a wide-ranging consultation underpinned by a variety of reports on unconventional gas extraction including fracking. This paper analyses the Scottish government approach from inception to conclusion, and from procedures to outcomes. The reports commissioned by the Scottish government include a comprehensive review dedicated specifically to public health as well as reports on climate change, economic impacts, transport, geology, and decommissioning. All these reports are relevant to public health, and taken together offer a comprehensive review of existing evidence. The approach is unique globally when compared with UOGE assessments conducted in the USA, Australia, Canada, and England. The review process builds a useful evidence base although it is not without flaws. The process approach, if not the content, offers a framework that may have merits globally. © 2018 by the authors.

Aircraft-collected GHG observations also have the potential to help quantify point-source emissions that may not be adequately sampled by fixed surface tower-based atmospheric observing systems. Here, we estimate CH4 emissions from a known point source, the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak in Los Angeles, CA from October 2015-February 2016, using atmospheric inverse models with airborne CH4 observations from twelve flights ≈4 km downwind of the leak and surface sensitivities from a mesoscale atmospheric transport model. This leak event has been well-quantified previously using various methods by the California Air Resources Board, thereby providing high confidence in the mass-balance leak rate estimates of (Conley et al 2016), used here for comparison to inversion results. Inversions with an optimal setup are shown to provide estimates of the leak magnitude, on average, within a third of the mass balance values, with remaining errors in estimated leak rates predominantly explained by modeled wind speed errors of up to 10 m s-1, quantified by comparing airborne meteorological observations with modeled values along the flight track. An inversion setup using scaled observational wind speed errors in the model-data mismatch covariance matrix is shown to significantly reduce the influence of transport model errors on spatial patterns and estimated leak rates from the inversions. In sum, this study takes advantage of a natural tracer release experiment (i.e. the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak) to identify effective approaches for reducing the influence of transport model error on atmospheric inversions of point-source emissions, while suggesting future potential for integrating surface tower and aircraft atmospheric GHG observations in top-down urban emission monitoring systems. © 2018 The Author(s).

The study assesses through a comparative approach the impact of building components on its energy performance and their environmental cost over the entire life cycle of the building. The life cycle analysis was performed using PLEIADES software tools. The results show that it is possible to reduce the energy requirements of both traditional and standard building envelopes by assigning low-consumption building scenarios. However, although these scenarios could reduce some environmental impacts, they could also enhance others. In order to improve the results of life cycle analysis, another variant that generates less impacts than previously simulated variants was developed by retaining the following environmental scenarios: superfluous material at the site, 5%; lifetime of doors and windows should be 30 years; coating life-time should be 10 years; use of natural gas for heating; wood energy for domestic hot water; consumption of cold water should be 0.2 m3/person/day; selective collection of glass, 50%; selective collection of paper, 30%; incinerated waste, 30%; and the produced waste should not be more than 1 kg/person/day. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Alcyone; BBC; Building envelope; Comfie; Dynamic simulation; Environmental impact; Life cycle analysis; Low energy consumption; novaEquer; Pleiades,cold water; hot water; natural gas; unclassified drug; water; Algeria; Article; building; building industry; climate; cost; energy resource; energy yield; environmental impact assessment; fluid intake; France; heating; incineration; life cycle; priority journal; simulation; software; temperature; waste,"Bouchair, A.; Department of Architecture, Algeria; эл. почта: abouchair@gmail.com",,SAGE Publications Ltd,1420326X,,IBENF,,English,Indoor Built Environ.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045381759

Managed pressure drilling (MPD) techniques are increasingly used as alternatives to conventional drilling operations to manage such extreme conditions and reduce drilling costs and risks. Many safety and operational issues related to MPD process need to be investigated more thoroughly. Well kick is considered a typical hazardous event that may occur at different drilling phases, and such an event is prone to develop into a blowout. During offshore drilling phases, the risk of accidents may change with time, and such a dynamic characteristic should be recorded in risk assessment. This study presents a method for the application of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) in conducting accident scenario analysis and dynamic quantitative risk assessment for MPD safety. This method can model the influence of uncertain risk factors, which have been ignored in existing research, by introducing an additional probability parameter. The effects of degradation are also taken into account. DBN inference is adopted to perform quantitative risk analysis and dynamic risk evolution. Then, the vulnerable root causes are identified by sensitivity analysis for accident prevention and mitigation measures. Well kick for four drilling cases is analyzed as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. Three-step analysis partially validates the correctness and rationality of the proposed DBN model. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Dynamic Bayesian network; Dynamic risk evolution; Managed pressure drilling phases; Quantitative risk assessment; Root causes,Accidents; Bayesian networks; Density of gases; Drilling fluids; Gas industry; Natural gas fields; Offshore drilling; Offshore gas fields; Offshore oil fields; Offshore oil wells; Oil fields; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Risks; Safety engineering; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Well drilling; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Dynamic risks; Managed Pressure Drilling; Quantitative risk assessment; Root cause; Risk assessment; accident; Article; Bayes theorem; controlled study; degradation; device failure; dynamic Bayesian network; dynamic risk evolution; environmental hazard; geological hazard; industry and industrial phenomena; managed pressure drilling; offshore oil industry; operator error; priority journal; quantitative analysis; quantitative risk analysis; risk; risk assessment; risk factor; root cause analysis; safety; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty,"Wu, S.; College of Mechanical and Transportation Engineering, Changping Fuxue Road 18, China; эл. почта: wushengnan@cup.edu.cn",,Elsevier B.V.,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

These substances are widely used in, or become byproducts of unconventional oil and natural gas (UOG) development and operations. Every stage of the UOG lifecycle, from well construction to extraction, operations, transportation and distribution can lead to air and water contamination. Residents near UOG operations can suffer from increased exposure to elevated concentrations of air and water pollutants. Here we focus on five air and water pollutants that have been associated with potentially permanent learning and neuropsychological deficits, neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological birth defects. Given the profound sensitivity of the developing brain and central nervous system, it is reasonable to conclude that young children who experience frequent exposure to these pollutants are at particularly high risk for chronic neurological diseases. More research is needed to understand the extent of these concerns in the context of UOG, but since UOG development has expanded rapidly in recent years, the need for public health prevention techniques, well-designed studies and stronger state and national regulatory standards is becoming increasingly apparent. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",BTEX; children; EDCs; heavy metals; PAHs; particulate matter; UOG,"natural gas; petroleum; adolescent; air pollutant; chemically induced; child; congenital disorder; environmental exposure; human; infant; learning disorder; mental disease; newborn; oil industry; preschool child; toxicity; water pollutant; Adolescent; Air Pollutants; Child; Child, Preschool; Congenital Abnormalities; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Learning Disorders; Natural Gas; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Oil and Gas Industry; Petroleum; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Webb, E.; Center for Environmental Health, 2201 Broadway, United States; эл. почта: webbe02@gmail.com",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,00487554,,REVHA,29068792.0,English,Rev.

Based on the calculation results, the consumption of fossil fuels and the corresponding CO2 emissions of Chongqing in 2020 are predicted, and the supporting data and corresponding policies are provided for the government of Chongqing to reach its goal as the economic unit of low-carbon emission in the ‘13th Five-Year Plan’. The results of the analysis show that there is a rapid decreasing trend of CO2 emissions in Chongqing during the ‘12th Five-Year Plan’, which are caused by the adjustment policy of the energy structure in Chongqing. Therefore, the analysis and prediction are primarily based on the adjustment of Chongqing’s coal energy consumption in this paper. At the initial stage, support vector regression (SVR) method is applied to predict the other fossil energy consumption and the corresponding CO2 emissions of Chongqing in 2020. Then, with the energy intensity of 2015 and the official target of CO2 intensity in 2020, the total fossil energy consumption and CO2 emissions of Chongqing in 2020 are predicted respectively. By the above results of calculation, the coal consumption and its corresponding CO2 emissions of Chongqing in 2020 are determined.

OBJECTIVE: We examined phase and trimester-specific associations between UGD activity and PTB. METHODS: We conducted a case–control study of women with singleton births in the Barnett Shale area, Texas, from 30 November 2010 to 29 November 2012. We individually age- and race/ethnicity-matched five controls to each PTB case (n = 13,328) and truncated controls’ time at risk according to the matched case’s gestational age. We created phase-specific UGD-activity metrics: a) inverse squared distance–weighted (IDW) count of wells in the drilling phase ≤0:5 mi (804.7 meters) of the residence and b) IDW sum of natural gas produced ≤0:5 mi of the residence. We also constructed trimester- and gestation-specific metrics. Metrics were categorized as follows: zero wells (reference), first, second, third tertiles of UGD activity. Analyses were repeated by PTB severity: extreme, very, and moderate (<28, 28 to <32, and 32 to <37 completed weeks). Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: We found increased odds of PTB in the third tertile of the UGD drilling {odds ratio (OR) =1:20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 1.37]} and UGD-production [OR = 1:15 (1.05, 1.26)] metrics. Among women in the third tertile of UGD-production, associations were strongest in trimesters one [OR = 1:18 (1.02, 1.37)] and two [OR = 1:14 (0.99, 1.31). The greatest risk was observed for extremely PTB [third tertile ORs: UGD drilling, 2.00 (1.23, 3.24); UGD production, 1.53 (1.03–2.27)]. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of differences in phase- and trimester-specific associations of UGD and PTB and indication of particular risk associated with extremely preterm birth. Future studies should focus on quantifying specific chemical and nonchemical stressors associated with UGD. © 2018, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The contribution of vehicle PM emissions to air pollution is typically quantified with emission inventories, which need vehicle emission factors as input. Heavy-duty vehicles, although they represent a small percentage of the vehicle population in nearly every major country, contribute the majority of the on-road PM emissions. However, the published data of modern heavy-duty vehicle emissions are scarce, and for the newest Euro VI technologies, almost non-existent. The main objective of this paper is to present Solid Particle Number (SPN) emission factors from Euro VI heavy-duty vehicles using diesel, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). Urban, rural and motorway (highway) emissions were determined on the road at various European cities using SPN Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS). Additional tests on a heavy-duty chassis dynamometer showed that the solid sub-23 nm fraction, which is not covered at the moment in the European regulation, is high, especially for CNG engines. The significant contribution of regeneration events and the effect of ambient temperature and engine cold-start on particle emissions were also discussed. © 2018 by the author.

Analyses of flowback wastewaters have revealed organic contamination from both geogenic and anthropogenic sources. The additional detections of undisclosed halogenated chemicals suggest unintended in situ transformation of reactive additives, but the formation pathways for these are unclear in subsurface brines. To develop an efficient experimental framework for investigating the complex shale-well parameter space, we have reviewed and synthesized geospatial well data detailing temperature, pressure, pH, and halide ion values as well as industrial chemical disclosure and concentration data. Our findings showed subsurface conditions can reach pressures up to 4500 psi (310 bars) and temperatures up to 95 °C, while at least 588 unique chemicals have been disclosed by industry, including reactive oxidants and acids. Given the extreme conditions necessary to simulate the subsurface, we briefly highlighted existing geochemical reactor systems rated to the necessary pressures and temperatures, identifying throughput as a key limitation. In response, we designed and developed a custom reactor system capable of achieving 5000 psi (345 bars) and 90 °C at low cost with 15 individual reactors that are readily turned over. To demonstrate the system's throughput, we simultaneously tested 12 disclosed HDHF chemicals against a radical initiator compound in simulated subsurface conditions, ruling out a dozen potential transformation pathways in a single experiment. This review outlines the dynamic and diverse parameter range experienced by HDHF chemical additives and provides an optimized framework and novel reactor system for the methodical study of subsurface transformation pathways. Ultimately, enabling such studies will provide urgently needed clarity for water treatment downstream or releases to the environment. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"acid; calcium carbonate; halide; halogen; industrial chemical; natural gas; Article; chemical procedures; chemical transformation; fracking; halogenation; hydraulic fracturing coupled with horizontal drilling; hyperbarism; pH; physical parameters; priority journal; salinity; temperature; water quality; water treatment; analysis; chemistry; fracking; pressure; procedures; theoretical model; waste water; water pollutant; Hydraulic Fracking; Models, Theoretical; Natural Gas; Pressure; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Plata, D.L.; Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, 17 Hillhouse Avenue, United States; эл. почта: desiree.plata@yale.edu",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,29313541.0,English,Environ.

We reviewed the literature on the association between fracking and psychological functioning, finding that although persons living in fracking communities may experience some minimal, initial benefits such as land lease income or infrastructure development, they may also experience worry, anxiety, and depression about lifestyle, health, safety, and financial security, as well as exposure to neurotoxins and changes to the physical landscape. Indeed, entire communities can experience collective trauma as a result of the “boom/bust” cycle that often occurs when industries impinge on community life. Impacted communities are often already vulnerable, including poor, rural, or indigenous persons, who may continue to experience the deleterious effects of fracking for generations. An influx of workers to fracking communities often stokes fears about outsiders and crime; yet, it must be recognized that this population of mobile workers is also vulnerable, often ostracized, and without social support. Practitioners, researchers, and policy makers alike should continue to investigate the potential psychological ramifications of fracking, so that effective and targeted intervention strategies can be developed, disseminated, and implemented to improve mental health in fracking communities. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Fracking; Hydraulic fracturing; Mental health; Quality of life; Rural; Stress,,"Hirsch, J.K.; Department of Psychology, 420 Rogers Stout Hall, United States; эл. почта: hirsch@etsu.edu",,Springer New York LLC,15571874,,,,English,Int.

A partial life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed using SimaPro 8 software with a functional unit of 1 kg of packaged tofu and a farm to factory gate boundary. Original production data for the period of 1 year were obtained from a tofu manufacturer based in the United States and used with soybean production data from SimaPro 8 Ecoinvent 3.1 and U.S. Life Cycle Inventory databases to calculate the associated GHGEs as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). The LCA calculations included resource inputs required to produce and package tofu: soybeans, water, electricity, natural gas, transportation, and packaging materials. The LCA boundary was from the cradle (i.e., soybean farm) to the factory exit gate (i.e., postpackaging). Uncertainty analyses were performed using Monte Carlo simulations. Total CO2e from packaged tofu were 982 g/kg, 9820 g/kg of protein, 1150 g/1000 calories, and 336 g/retail packet of 396 g. For 1 kg of packaged tofu, 16% of CO2e resulted from soybean production, 52% from tofu manufacturing, 23% from packaging, and 9% from transportation.

Hence, various interventions to reduce HAP have been advocated or piloted in many countries. To provide additional evidence on the effectiveness and applicability of the interventions in various settings, we investigate the effects of clean fuel for cooking on the risks of respiratory illness of children below five years old in the Philippines. We apply the propensity score matching method on a subsample of households culled from the 2013 round of the National Demographic and Health Survey to account for the systematic differences in their characteristics that could influence their choices of cooking fuel. We find that the use of electricity, liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas or biogas can lower by 2.4 percentage points the incidence of severe coughing with difficulty in breathing in young children.

While theoretical frameworks like construal-level theory and the “Not in My Backyard” (or NIMBY) moniker provide insight into these spatial dynamics, case studies in specific locations experiencing energy development reveal substantial variation in community responses. Larger-scale studies exploring the link between proximity and support have been hampered by data quality and availability. We draw on a unique data set that includes geo-coded data from national surveys (nine waves; n = 19,098) and high-resolution well location data to explore the relationship between proximity and both familiarity with and support for hydraulic fracturing. We use two different measures of proximity—respondent distance to the nearest well and the density of wells within a certain radius of the respondent’s location. We find that both types of proximity to new development are linked to more familiarity with hydraulic fracturing, even after controlling for various individual and contextual factors, but only distance-based proximity is linked to more support for the practice. When significant, these relationships are similar to or exceed the effects of race, income, gender, and age. We discuss the implications of these findings for effective risk communication as well as the importance of incorporating spatial analysis into public opinion research on perceptions of energy development. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis.",Fracking; Geographic proximity; Hydraulic fracturing; Public opinion; Unconventional oil and gas,Fracture; Location; Natural gas; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Energy development; Geographic proximity; Not in my backyards; Public opinions; Substantial variations; Theoretical framework; Unconventional oil; Unconventional oil and gas; Hydraulic fracturing; community response; data quality; exploration; hydraulic fracturing; hydrocarbon reservoir; natural gas; perception; resource development; spatial analysis; United States,"Boudet, H.S.; Department of Sociology, 300 Bexell Hall, United States; эл. почта: hilary.boudet@oregonstate.edu",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,02724332,,RIAND,,English,Risk Anal.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062402636

Since 2010 the port of Gladstone has undergone extensive expansion to facilitate the increasing coal export as well as the new development of three recently completed LNG facilities. Significant environmental and socioeconomic impacts and concerns have occurred as a result of these developments. The overall aim of the article, therefore, is to identify the risk governance deficits that arose and to formulate processes capable of improving similar decision-making problems in the future. The structure of the IRGC framework is followed because it represents a broad analytical approach for considering risk assessment and risk governance in Gladstone in ways that include, but also go beyond, the risk approach of the ISO 31000:2009 standard that was employed at the time. The IRGC risk framework is argued to be a consistent and comprehensive risk governance framework that integrates scientific, economic, social, and cultural aspects and advocates the notion of inclusive risk governance through stakeholder communication and involvement. Key aspects related to risk preassessment, risk appraisal, risk tolerability and acceptability, risk management, and stakeholder communication and involvement are considered. The results indicate that the risk governance deficits include aspects related to (i) the risk matrix methodology, (ii) reflecting uncertainties, (iii) cumulative risks, (iv) the regulatory process, and (v) stakeholder communication and involvement. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis.",Risk assessment; Risk governance; Risk management,Decision making; Gas fuel purification; Liquefied natural gas; Risk management; Analytical approach; Comprehensive risks; Decision-making problem; Natural gas development; Retrospective analysis; Risk governance; Socio-economic impacts; Stakeholder communications; Risk assessment; coal; governance approach; liquefied natural gas; resource development; risk assessment; socioeconomic impact; stakeholder; Australia; Gladstone; Queensland,"Van Der Vegt, R.G.; Northern Institute, Australia; эл. почта: Rens.vandervegt@cdu.edu.au",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,02724332,,RIAND,29481704.0,English,Risk Anal.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062391846

Materials and Methods: The ontogenesis of experimental animals were between 36 and 730 days: Intact ones, those subjected to the action of subtoxic doses of sulfur-bearing gas, and those receiving a protector-drug 'Etoksidol'. The data on microcirculation were obtained using laser Doppler flowmetry. The industrial sulfur-containing natural gas of the Astrakhan gas condensate field was used as a toxic agent. It was revealed that the reducing intensity of blood microcirculation in the red bone marrow of intact rats is statistically more significance in the presenile period of ontogenesis compared with the earlier periods. Results: The use of 'Etoksidol' along with the influence of sulfur-containing pollutant on the experimental animals of different age groups led to improvement of microcirculation in the bone marrow at all the studied stages of ontogeny. However, such improvement was statistically highly significant (P < 0.01) in the mature age I, very close to significant in the mature age II, and was not statistically significant in the young and presenile age. Conclusions: As a result, the following findings were obtained: The toxic effect greatly reduces the intensity of the microcirculation in the bone marrow, which is most pronounced in younger animals; the experimental results suggest that the drug 'Etoksidol,' with an antihypoxic and antioxidant action, has a positive effect on red bone marrow microvasculature. © 2018 Journal of Postgraduate Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Etoksidol; hemomicrocirculation; postnatal ontogenesis; rats; sulfur-containing gas,antioxidant; etoksidol; sulfur; unclassified drug; animal experiment; antioxidant activity; Article; bone marrow microcirculation; controlled study; developmental stage; drug effect; embryo; environmental factor; laser Doppler flowmetry; male; microcirculation; microvasculature; nonhuman; ontogeny; rat; stress,"Ovsyannikova, O.A.; Department of Pathological Physiology of Astrakhan State Medical University, 121 Bakinskaya St., Russian Federation; эл. почта: editor4@academicpeper.org",,Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications,0976500X,,,,English,J.

This paper presents a novel method of synthesising the copper-manganese oxide (Hopcalite) catalyst that is used for the removal of volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gases like carbon monoxide. Several samples prepared under different conditions, with and without ultrasound, were subjected to a series of characterisation tests such as XRD, BET, FE-SEM, EDX, TPR-H2, TGA and FT-IR in order to establish their chemical and physical properties. A series of catalytic tests using a micro-reactor were subsequently performed on the samples in order to substantiate the aforementioned properties by analysing their ability to oxidise compressed natural gas (CNG), containing methane and sulphur dioxide. Results showed that ultrasonic irradiation of the catalyst led to observable alterations in its morphology: surfaces of the particles were noticeably smoothed and an increased in amorphicity was detected. Furthermore, ultrasonic irradiation has shown to enhance the catalytic activity of Hopcalite, achieving a higher conversion of methane relative to non-sonicated samples. Varying the ultrasonic intensity also produced appreciable effects, whereby an increase in intensity results in a higher conversion rate. The catalyst sonicated at the highest intensity of 29.7 W/cm2 has a methane conversion rate of 13.5% at 400 °C, which was the highest among all the samples tested. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Co-precipitation; Copper manganese oxide; Methane oxidation; Sonochemical synthesis; Ultrasound,Carbon monoxide; Characterization; Compressed natural gas; Copper oxides; Coprecipitation; Greenhouse gases; Irradiation; Manganese oxide; Methane; Sonochemistry; Sulfur determination; Sulfur dioxide; Ultrasonics; Volatile organic compounds; Chemical and physical properties; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Conversion of methanes; Copper manganese oxides; Coprecipitation synthesis; Materials science and engineering; Methane oxidation; Sonochemical synthesis; Catalyst activity; copper; manganese oxide; methane; natural gas; sulfur dioxide; adsorption; Article; catalyst; desorption; field emission scanning electron microscopy; greenhouse gas; infrared spectroscopy; morphology; precipitation; priority journal; scanning transmission electron microscopy; surface area; synthesis; thermogravimetry; ultrasound; waste component removal; X ray diffraction,"Tiong, T.J.; Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Jalan Broga, Malaysia; эл. почта: joyce.tiong@nottingham.edu.my",,Elsevier B.V.,13504177,,ULSOE,28946460.0,English,Ultrason.

The research indicates that, on the condition of separately taking Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPpc), energy structure (Es), and urbanisation level (Ul) as transition variables, three models all reject the null hypothesis of a linear relationship, i.e., a non-linear relationship exists. The results show that the three models all contain only one transition function but different numbers of location parameters. The model taking GDPpc as the transition variable has two location parameters, while the other two models separately considering Es and Ul as the transition variables both contain one location parameter. The three models applied in the study all favourably describe the non-linear relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions in China. It also can be seen that the conversion rate of the influence of Ul on per capita CO2 emissions is significantly higher than those of GDPpc and Es on per capita CO2 emissions. © 2017 by the authors.

The purpose of this study is to describe the health of adults in communities with intense UNGD who presented for evaluation of symptoms. Records of 135 structured health assessments conducted between February 2012 and October 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. Publicly available data were used to determine proximity to gas wells. Analysis was restricted to records of adults who lived within 1 km of a well in Pennsylvania and denied employment in the gas industry (n = 51). Symptoms in each record were reviewed by a physician. Symptoms that could be explained by pre-existing or concurrent conditions or social history and those that began or worsened prior to exposure were excluded. Exposure was calculated using date of well drilling within 1 km. The number of symptoms/participant ranged from 0 to 19 (mean = 6.2; SD = 5.1). Symptoms most commonly reported were: sleep disruption, headache, throat irritation, stress or anxiety, cough, shortness of breath, sinus problems, fatigue, nausea, and wheezing. These results are consistent with findings of prior studies using self-report without physician review. In comparison, our results are strengthened by the collection of health data by a health care provider, critical review of symptoms for possible alternative causes, and confirmation of timing of exposure to unconventional natural gas well relative to symptom onset or exacerbation. Our findings confirm earlier studies and add to the growing body of evidence of the association between symptoms and exposure to UNGD. © 2017",Fracking; Health; Hydraulic fracturing; Shale gas; Unconventional gas,natural gas; abdominal pain; adult; anxiety disorder; arthralgia; Article; blister; child; coughing; drowsiness; dry eye; dyspnea; environmental exposure; environmental health; epistaxis; eye allergy; fatigue; gas field; hair loss; headache; health care personnel; health status; heart palpitation; human; major clinical study; memory disorder; mood disorder; nausea; neighborhood; oil shale; paresthesia; Pennsylvania; priority journal; rash; retrospective study; self report; sinusitis; sleep disorder; symptom; thorax pain; throat irritation; tinnitus; wheezing,"Weinberger, B.; Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project, The Grove, 760 Chapel St., United States; эл. почта: bweinberger@environmentalhealthproject.org",,Elsevier Inc.,22113355,,,,English,Preventive Med.

Given the large contribution of sugar and lignocellulosic feedstocks to biorefinery operating costs, natural gas and other C1 sources may provide an economic advantage. To assess the relative costs of these feedstocks, we performed flux balance analysis on genome-scale metabolic models to calculate the maximum theoretical yields of chemical products from methane, methanol, acetate, and glucose. Yield calculations were performed for every metabolite (as a proxy for desired products) in the genome-scale metabolic models of three organisms: Escherichia coli (bacterium), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (cyanobacterium). The calculated theoretical yields and current feedstock prices provided inputs to create comparative feedstock cost surfaces. Our analysis shows that, at current market prices, methane feedstock costs are consistently lower than glucose when used as a carbon and energy source for microbial chemical production. Conversely, methanol is costlier than glucose under almost all price scenarios. Acetate feedstock costs could be less than glucose given efficient acetate production from low-cost syngas using nascent biological gas to liquids (BIO-GTL) technologies. Our analysis suggests that research should focus on overcoming the technical challenges of methane assimilation and/or yield of acetate via BIO-GTL to take advantage of low-cost natural gas rather than using methanol as a feedstock. © 2017",,acetic acid; butanol; dihydroxyacetone; glucose; isobutanol; methane; methanol; pyruvic acid; Article; biomass production; carbon source; citric acid cycle; cost benefit analysis; energy resource; Escherichia coli; feedstock; fermentation medium; flux balance analysis; industrial production; mathematical model; microbial metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Synechococcus,"Pfleger, B.F.; Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, United States; эл. почта: pfleger@engr.wisc.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,22140301,,,,English,Metab.

Here, we report the synthesis and construction of a metal-organic framework (MOF), kag-MOF-1, that has adequate structural and chemical features and affords a stable adsorbent with unique and appropriate adsorption properties for gas processing akin to acid gas removal, dehydration, and benzene-toluene-xylene (BTX) sieving. A combination of X-ray diffraction experiments, adsorption studies, mixed-gas breakthrough adsorption column testing, calorimetric measurements, and molecular simulations corroborated the exceptional separation performance of kag-MOF-1 and its prospective use as a multifunctional adsorbent. The unique adsorption properties of kag-MOF-1, resulting from the contracted pore system with aligned periodic array of exposed functionalities, attest to the prominence of this new generation of ultra-microporous material as a prospective practical adsorbent toward cost-effective and more simplified gas and vapor processing flowcharts for natural gas upgrading and flue gas scrubbing. Various key gas and vapor separations require highly energy-intensive processes with an associated exorbitant cost, namely CO2 and H2S removal from valuable industrial gases, benzene-toluene-xylene (BTX) elimination before the production of elemental sulfur, and the compulsory dehydration of gases before transport. Deployment of advanced solid-state adsorbent materials offers great prospects of introducing efficient separation processes with less or no parasitic energy associated with the regeneration of the sorbent. Markedly, the development of innovative separation agents that capture CO2, H2O, and H2S while excluding BTX is highly desirable because it allows access to a simplified gas processing flow chart for processing valued industrial gases. A highly stable kag-MOF-1, produced by easy and economical synthesis, has a high affinity for H2O, CO2, and H2S and sieves impurities such as benzene, toluene, and xylene completely. This material has the potential to carry out many industrially important separations such as acid gas removal, dehydration, and benzene-toluene-xylene (BTX) sieving in an energy-efficient manner. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",BTX; dehydration; gas separation; H2S; metal-organic frameworks; MOFs; natural gas upgrading; ultra-micropores,,"Eddaoudi, M.; Institut Charles Gerhardt Montpellier (UMR CNRS 5253), Place E.

While the natural gas boom affected many people through lower energy prices, the strongest effects were concentrated in smaller communities where the fracking occurred. We analyze one potential cost to communities where fracking takes place: an increase of sexually transmitted diseases. We use a quasi-natural experiment within the Marcellus shale region plus panel data estimation techniques to quantify the impact of fracking activity on local gonorrhea incidences. We found fracking activity to be associated with an increase in gonorrhea. Our findings may be useful to public health officials.

As the gas pipeline network becoming vaster and more complex, accident may occur caused by the leak of gas pipeline network. Accidents consequences caused by gas pipeline rupture, can directly threaten the safety of persons and properties in the city. Thus, it is necessary to do risk assessment for natural gas pipeline network. In this work, risk assessment of natural gas pipeline network for Baharan town in Sanandaj city was investigated. Methods: In this study, there was a limitation because of unavailable and managed required data for the risk management process. Thus, for the risk assessment, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique was used in municipal gas distribution network. After investigating the reported data of any accidents and leakages, the main effective parameters were recognized and the related quantitative weights were determined. Results: The statistical analysis showed a spill event municipal gas distribution network for a period of three and a half years (from the beginning of 1390 to the end of the summer of the 1393), as a factor based on the selected studied area (Baharan town, Sanandaj city). Between the investigated factors and based on the AHP technique, involvement index of individuals and substance hazard (0.165, 0.15, respectively) showed the maximal amounts of the most important parameters with major effects on the risk assessment and pressure index (0.0031) showed the minimal amount with the minor effect on the investigation. Conclusion: To assess the risk factors of municipal gas pipeline network, there was no a well-covered investigation for complete requirement in Iran. Therefore, because of the useful data obtained by the used AHP technique, it is recommended gas safety managers to use these methods. In this study, the most important factors for promoting safety and reducing accidents in municipal gas distribution network in gas distribution lines were identified.",Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); Pipeline networks; Risk assessment,,"Kani, E.N.; Chemical Engineering, United States; эл. почта: e-najafi@semnan.ac.ir",,Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Health Services,17355133,,,,Persian,Iran Occup.

Furthermore, building materials and architecture may detract from system efficiency. An additional difficulty is the source of energy: when monuments are in remote areas, fuels such as natural gas may not be available, although on occasion they may not be used even when they are available. The present study explores the thermal comfort provided by heating systems generally used in Spanish churches: decentralized gas burner system (propane) and centralized air heating systems (natural gas, fuel oil) based on a new monitoring methodology using temperature, relative humidity and airflow sensors. The church at Talamanca de Jarama (fuel oil) delivered the highest thermal comfort based on environmental conditions, whereas the system installed at Algete (natural gas) was the most energy efficient.

This article summarizes the first national-level, integrated assessment of the future costs and benefits of existing RPS policies; the same metrics are evaluated under a second scenario in which widespread expansion of these policies is assumed to occur. Depending on assumptions about renewable energy technology advancement and natural gas prices, existing RPS policies increase electric system costs by as much as $31 billion, on a present-value basis over 2015-2050. The expanded renewable deployment scenario yields incremental costs that range from $23 billion to $194 billion, depending on the assumptions employed. The monetized value of improved air quality and reduced climate damages exceed these costs. Using central assumptions, existing RPS policies yield $97 billion in air-pollution health benefits and $161 billion in climate damage reductions. Under the expanded RPS case, health benefits total $558 billion and climate benefits equal $599 billion. These scenarios also yield benefits in the form of reduced water use. RPS programs are not likely to represent the most cost effective path towards achieving air quality and climate benefits. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that US RPS programs are, on a national basis, cost effective when considering externalities. © 2017 The Author(s).

At the same time, there is significant water formed during combustion. However, this water is not currently widely harvested at the site of production. Instead, it is added to the hydrologic cycle, often in a different location from the fuel production site. This study quantifies the water formed from combustion of these fuels and analyzes the magnitudes of formation in the context of other hydrologic sources and sinks in order to facilitate future assessments of water harvesting technology and/or atmospheric impacts of combustion. Annual water formation from stoichiometric combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, including natural gas, oil-and natural gas liquid-derived products, and coal, in the United States and worldwide are presented and compared with quantities of water sequestered, evaporated, and stored in the atmosphere. Water production factors in terms of mass and energy of fuel consumed, WPFm and WPFe, respectively, are defined for the comparison of fuels and incorporation into future life cycle analyses (LCAs). Results show that water formation from combustion has increased worldwide from 2005 to 2015, with the largest increase coming from growth in combustion of natural gas. Water formation from combustion of hydrocarbon fuels equals or exceeds water sequestered from the hydrologic cycle through deep well injection in the US annually. Overall, water formation is deemed significant enough to warrant consideration by LCAs of water intensity in fuel production and use, and should be included in future analyses. © 2017 The Author(s).

Two modelling tools were used for the purposes of this study, namely OnSSET and OSeMOSYS. The tools were soft-linked in order to capture both the spatial and temporal dynamics of their nature. Two electricity demand scenarios were developed representing low and high end user consumption goals respectively. Indicatively, results show that geothermal, coal, hydro and natural gas would consist the optimal energy mix for the centralized national grid. However, in the case of the low demand scenario a high penetration of stand-Alone systems is evident in the country, reaching out to approximately 47% of the electrified population. Increasing end user consumption leads to a shift in the optimal technology mix, with higher penetration of mini-grid technologies and grid extension. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Kenya; Off-grid; Onsset; Optimization; Osemosys; SDG,Coal industry; Electric utilities; Optimization; Electricity demands; Kenya; Off-grids; Onsset; Optimal technology; Osemosys; Standalone systems; Temporal dynamics; Geothermal energy; demand analysis; electricity; electrification; energy planning; long-term change; natural gas; optimization; spatial analysis; sustainable development; United Nations; Kenya,"Moksnes, N.; KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Brinellvägen 68, Sweden; эл. почта: nandi@kth.se",,IOP Publishing Ltd,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030751684

This practice reduces emissions from landfills, prevents the loss of waste energy, and conserves fossil fuel resources. The aim of our study was to conduct a life cycle assessment (LCA) of clinker production in cement kilns using a combination of natural gas, mazut, a form of heavy, low-quality fuel oil, and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from Tehran. We used SimaPro 7.1 software to perform an LCA of 1 kilogram (kg) of clinker produced using the following fuel combinations: the first scenario involved natural gas consumption alone, the second scenario involved a combination of natural gas and mazut, with the mazut providing 5% to 30% of the heating value needed to produce cement clinker in the kiln, and the third scenario involved a combination of natural gas and RDF (providing 5% to 30% of the heating needed in the kiln). The impact categories in the LCA of global warming, eutrophication, and acidification were assessed by the Center of Environmental Science of Leiden University (Centrum voor Milieukunde Leiden—CML) CML 2000 method. The results indicated that the third scenario, involving natural gas and RDF, reduced acidification by 2.14–11.5% and global warming by 0–1.3% relative to the first scenario involving the use of only natural gas. In addition, we observed a 0.65–3.81% reduction in acidification and a 0.9–3.8% reduction in global warming under the third scenario compared with the second scenario (co-firing of natural gas and mazut). The amount of nitrogen oxides (NOX) emitted from the combustion of the Tehran RDF was greater than that was emitted when burning mazut. Therefore, reduction of nitrogen from the RDF composition is necessary. This study indicates that the use of Tehran RDF (with reduced nitrogen) in Tehran cement kilns does not increase cement kiln NOX, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; however, we need to conduct additional investigation into the chemical composition of the Tehran waste before using solid waste in place of fossil fuels. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,alternative fuel; carbon dioxide; cement; emission control; fossil fuel; global warming; industrial production; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; nitrogen oxides; sulfur dioxide; Iran; Tehran [Iran],"Asadollahfardi, G.; Civil Engineering Department, Iran; эл. почта: asadollahfardi@yahoo.com",,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,10881913,,,,English,Environ.

The subjects of this study were 55 people in total who were divided into four experimental groups, each of which comprised of 11 members (based on the type of fuel used), and one control group comprised of 11 members. Using CometScore, the subjects' peripheral blood lymphocytes were examined for DNA damage. All bakers, that is, experimental subjects, showed significantly greater peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA damage compared to the individuals in the control group. There was greater peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA damage in bakers who had been using firewood for fuel compared to those using other types of fuel to such an extent that tail moments (μm) for firewood-burning bakers was 4.40 ± 1.98 versus 1.35 ± 0.84 for natural gas, 1.85 ± 1.33 for diesel, and 2.19 ± 2.20 for kerosene.

The Occupational Health and Safety Administration cites H2S as a leading cause of workplace gas inhalation deaths. Mass casualties of H2S toxicity may be caused by exposure from industrial accidents or release from oil field sites. H2S is also an attractive terrorism tool because of its high toxicity and ease with which it can be produced. Several potential antidotes have been proposed for hydrogen sulfide poisoning but none have been completely successful. Objective: The objective was to compare treatment response assessed by the time to spontaneous ventilation among groups of swine with acute H2S-induced apnea treated with intravenous (IV) cobinamide (4 mg/kg in 0.8 mL of 225 mmol/L solution), IV hydroxocobalamin (4 mg/kg in 5 mL of saline), or saline alone. Methods: Twenty-four swine (45–55 kg) were anesthetized, intubated, and instrumented with continuous femoral and pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. After stabilization, anesthesia was adjusted such that animals would spontaneously ventilate with an FiO2 of 0.21. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS; concentration of 8 mg/mL) was begun at 1 mg/kg/min until apnea was confirmed for 20 seconds by capnography. This infusion rate was sustained for 1.5 minutes postapnea and then decreased to a maintenance rate for the remainder of the study to replicate sustained clinical exposure. Animals were randomly assigned to receive cobinamide (4 mg/kg), hydroxocobalamin (4 mg/kg), or saline and monitored for 60 minutes beginning 1 minute postapnea. G* power analysis using the Z-test determined that equal group sizes of eight animals were needed to achieve a power of 80% in detecting a 50% difference in return to spontaneous ventilations at α = 0.05. Results: There were no significant differences in baseline variables. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the mg/kg dose of NaHS (5.6 mg/kg; p = 0.45) required to produce apnea. Whereas all of the cobinamide-treated animals survived (8/8), none of the control (0/8) or hydroxocobalamin (0/8)-treated animals survived. Mean (±SD) time to spontaneous ventilation in the cobinamide-treated animals was 3.2 (±1.1) minutes. Conclusions: Cobinamide successfully rescued the severely NaHS-poisoned swine from apnea in the absence of assisted ventilation. © 2017 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine",,"cobinamide; hydrogen sulfide; hydroxocobalamin; sodium chloride; antidote; cobamamide; cobinamide; hydrogen sulfide; hydroxocobalamin; sodium bisulfide; sodium chloride; sulfide; animal experiment; animal model; Article; breathing; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; female; hydrogen sulfide toxicity; hydrogen sulfide toxicity; infusion rate; lung artery pressure; nonhuman; outcome assessment; porcine model; priority journal; toxicity; treatment response; animal; apnea; chemically induced; comparative study; disease model; intravenous drug administration; pig; Administration, Intravenous; Animals; Antidotes; Apnea; Cobamides; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Hydrogen Sulfide; Hydroxocobalamin; Sodium Chloride; Sulfides; Sus scrofa; Swine","Bebarta, V.S.; Department of Emergency Medicine, United States; эл. почта: Vikhyat.bebarta@ucdenver.edu",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,10696563,,AEMEF,28472554.0,English,Acad.

The available studies on this topic lack consistent methodology and ignore aspects of oil and gas development of value to public health-relevant assessment and decision-making. OBJECTIVES: We aim to present a methodological framework for oil and gas development proximity studies grounded in an understanding of hydrocarbon geology and development techniques. Methods: We geospatially overlay locations of active oil and gas wells in the conterminous United States and Census data to estimate the population living in proximity to hydrocarbon development at the national and state levels. We compare our methods and findings with existing proximity studies. Results: Nationally, we estimate that 17.6 million people live within 1,600 m (~ 1 mi) of at least one active oil and/or gas well. Three of the eight studies overestimate populations at risk from actively producing oil and gas wells by including wells without evidence of production or drilling completion and/or using inappropriate population allocation methods. The remaining five studies, by omitting conventional wells in regions dominated by historical conventional development, significantly underestimate populations at risk. Conclusions: The well inventory guidelines we present provide an improved methodology for hydrocarbon proximity studies by acknowledging the importance of both conventional and unconventional well counts as well as the relative exposure risks associated with different primary production categories (e.g., oil, wet gas, dry gas) and developmental stages of wells. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

In this study, the FP group is defined as comprising households that must spend approximately 3.8% of its household income on heating, based on natural gas consumption on heating. The results show that seniors in the FP group paid significantly higher heating costs while earning much less in income compared to those in the NFP group. The respondents in the FP group were more likely to be older, females, widowed, comprising single-person households and in poorer health, compared to those in the NFP group. The FP households tend to live in houses that are 10 years older and 138 square foot (12.8206 m2) smaller with worse building envelope quality than the NFP households. The income of nearly half of these seniors suffering fuel poverty records just above the income standards of the energy support programmes, and hence they spend considerable amount of their income on heating. This is one of the main reasons why many seniors in the U.S. experience fuel poverty.

However, unlike natural gas, hydrogen is difficult to store and distribute. One solution is to convert the hydrogen into other fuels or bulk chemicals. In this study we investigated fermentation in which homoacetogenic clostridia apply the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway to generate acetate from H2 and CO2. Acetate can be used as a bulk chemical or further transformed into biofuels. Autotrophic growth with CO2 as the sole carbon source is slow compared to heterotrophic growth, so the aim of this work was to improve continuous gas fermentation by immobilising the acetate-producing clostridia, thus preventing their wash out from the bioreactor. Two homoacetogenic bacterial strains (Acetobacterium woodii and Moorella thermoacetica) were tested for their acetate production potential, with A. woodii proving to be the better strain with maximum acetate concentration of 29.57 g l−1. Due to its stability during fermentation and good bacterial immobilisation, linen was chosen as immobilisation material for continuous fermentation. This study demonstrates the successful continuous fermentation of acetate from H2 and CO2 using A. woodii immobilised on a low-cost surface at high volumetric productivity of 1.21 ± 0.05 g acetate l−1 d−1. This has great industrial potential and future studies should focus on the scale-up of this process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Acetobacterium woodii; Gas fermentation; Homoacetogenic clostridia; Immobilisation on linen,acetic acid; acetic acid derivative; carbon dioxide; hydrogen; Acetobacterium; Acetobacterium woodii; Article; autotrophy; bacterial strain; bioreactor; biotechnological procedures; carbon source; chemical composition; chemical modification; chemical reaction kinetics; concentration (parameters); controlled study; fermentation; immobilization; molecular stability; Moorella thermoacetica; nonhuman; physical chemistry; physical parameters; priority journal; process optimization; Acetobacterium; bioreactor; metabolism; Acetates; Acetobacterium; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Fermentation; Hydrogen,"Rachbauer, L.; Institute of Environmental Biotechnology, Konrad-Lorenz-Straße 20, Austria; эл. почта: lydia.rachbauer@bioenergy2020.eu",,Academic Press,10759964,,ANAEF,28648471.0,English,Anaerobe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022034314

With the presence of explosive fumes or fuels there also exists the possibility of burn injury. Methods We searched for cases of fatal and non-fatal major burns with TASER® electrical weapon usage where there was a possibility that the weapon ignited the explosion. Results We confirmed 6 cases of fatal burn injury and 4 cases of major non-fatal burns out of 3.17 million field uses. The mean age was 35.5 ± 9.7 years which is consistent with the typical arrest-related death. Moderate, minor, and noninjurious fires — typically due to a cigarette lighters in a pocket, petrol, recreational inhalants, or body spray were also noted. Conclusions The use of electrical weapons presents a small but real risk of death from fatal burn injury. It also presents a small risk of major non-fatal burn injury.

Bio-gas, a methane -rich energy gas, is produced by microbial decomposition of organic matter through an-aerobic conditions where the presence of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide affects its performance. Although the microbiological process in the AD can be tailored to enhance the bio-gas composition, physical treatment is needed to convert the bio-gas into bio-methane. Water washing is the most common method for upgrading bio-gas for bio-methane production, but its large use of water is challenging towards industrial scale-up. Hence, the present study focuses on scale-up comparison of water washing with activated-carbon adsorption using HYSYS and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer. The models show that for plants processing less than 500 m3/h water scrubbing was cost effective compared with activated carbon. However, against current fossil natural-gas cost of about 1 p/kWh in the UK both relied heavily on governmental subsidies to become economically feasible. For plants operating at 1000 m3/hr, the treatment costs were reduced to below 1.5 p/kWh for water scrubbing and 0.9 p/kWh for activated carbon where the main benefits of activated carbon were lower capital and operating costs and virtually no water losses. It is envisioned that this method can significantly aid the production of sustainable bio-methane. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Activated carbon; Adsorption; An-aerobic digestion; ASPEN; Bio-methane; Microbiology,activated carbon; biogas; methane; natural gas; water; biofuel; carbon; carbon dioxide; charcoal; hydrogen sulfide; methane; adsorption kinetics; anaerobic digestion; analytic method; Article; cost effectiveness analysis; feasibility study; fossil; priority journal; processing; scale up; sustainable development; United Kingdom; water loss; adsorption; anaerobic growth; biochemistry; bioreactor; biosynthesis; chemistry; temperature; workflow; Adsorption; Anaerobiosis; Biochemical Phenomena; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Charcoal; Hydrogen Sulfide; Methane; Temperature; Workflow,"Farooq, M.; IMPEE, James Nasmyth Building, United Kingdom; эл. почта: mf181@hw.ac.uk",,Academic Press,10759964,,ANAEF,28483497.0,English,Anaerobe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019087935

In general, analysts must decide how to aggregate the climatic effects of different technologies, taking into account differences in the properties of the gases (differences in atmospheric lifetimes and instantaneous radiative efficiencies) as well as different technology characteristics (differences in emission factors and technology lifetimes). Available metrics proposed in the literature have incorporated these features in different ways and have arrived at different conclusions. In this paper, we develop a general framework for classifying metrics based on whether they measure: (a) cumulative or end point impacts, (b) impacts over a fixed time horizon or up to a fixed end year, and (c) impacts from a single emissions pulse or from a stream of pulses over multiple years. We then use the comparison between compressed natural gas and gasoline-fueled vehicles to illustrate how the choice of metric can affect conclusions about technologies. Finally, we consider tradeoffs involved in selecting a metric, show how the choice of metric depends on the framework that is assumed for climate change mitigation, and suggest which subset of metrics are likely to be most analytically self-consistent. © 2017 The Author(s).

METHODS: Sister Study participants (n = 50,884) were recruited from 2003–2009. Breast cancer–free women in the United States or Puerto Rico, 35–74 y old, with a sister with breast cancer were eligible. Participants completed questionnaires on indoor heating and cooking practices for both their enrollment and their longest adult residence. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association between indoor heating/cooking and breast cancer. RESULTS: A total of 2,416 breast cancer cases were diagnosed during follow-up (mean = 6:4 y). Having an indoor wood-burning stove/fireplace in the longest adult residence was associated with a higher breast cancer risk [HR = 1:11 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.22)]; the risk increased with average frequency of use [≥once/week, HR = 1:17 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.34)] (p for trend = 0:01). An elevated HR was seen for women burning wood [HR = 1:09 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.21)] or natural gas/propane [HR = 1:15 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.32)]. No association was observed for burning artificial fire-logs [HR = 0:98 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.12)] except among women from western states [HR = 1:36 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.81)]. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, using an indoor wood-burning stove/fireplace in the longest adult residence at least once a week and burning either wood or natural gas/propane was associated with a modestly higher risk of breast cancer. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Despite this, almost three billion people worldwide still use solid fuels to meet their cooking needs. To better support practitioners and policy-makers, this paper presents a new model for comparing cooking solutions and its key output metric: the 'levelized cost of cooking a meal' (LCCM). The model is applied to compare several cooking solutions in the case study area of Nyeri County in Kenya. The cooking access targets are connected to the International Workshop Agreement and Global Tracking Framework's tiers of cooking energy access. Results show how an increased energy access with improved firewood and charcoal cookstoves could reduce both household's LCCMs and the total costs compared to traditional firewood cooking over the modelling period. On the other hand, switching to cleaner cooking solutions, such as LPG-and electricity, would result in higher costs for the end-user highlighting that this transition is not straightforward. The paper also contextualizes the results into the wider socio-economic context. It finds that a tradeoff is present between minimizing costs for households and meeting household priorities, thus maximizing the potential benefits of clean cooking without dismissing the use of biomass altogether. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",clean cookstoves; Cooking energy access; Kenya; levelized cost of cooking a meal (LCCM); modern cooking,Charcoal; Fuels; Cooking energies; Global tracking; International workshops; Kenya; Levelized costs; Minimizing costs; Potential benefits; Socio-economics; Costs; biomass; charcoal; cost analysis; electricity; energy budget; equipment; liquefied natural gas; numerical model; policy making; Kenya; Kenya; Nyeri,"Nerini, F.F.; Energy Institute, United Kingdom; эл. почта: f.fusonerini@gmail.com",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021304555

The Interagency Task Force on Natural Gas Storage Safety and California regulators recently recommended operators phase out single-point-of-failure (SPF) well designs. Here, we develop a national dataset of UGS well activity in the continental US to assess regulatory data availability and uncertainty, and to assess the prevalence of certain well design deficiencies including single-point-of-failure designs. We identified 14 138 active UGS wells associated with 317 active UGS facilities in 29 states using regulatory and company data. State-level wellbore datasets contained numerous reporting inconsistencies that limited data concatenation. We identified 2715 active UGS wells across 160 facilities that, like the failed well at Aliso Canyon, predated the storage facility, and therefore were not originally designed for gas storage. The majority (88%) of these repurposed wells are located in OH, MI, PA, NY, and WV. Repurposed wells have a median age of 74 years, and the 2694 repurposed wells constructed prior to 1979 are particularly likely to exhibit design-related deficiencies. An estimated 210 active repurposed wells were constructed before 1917-before cement zonal isolation methods were utilized.

Comparisons of the minimum and real work for separating CO2 from air, natural gas combined cycle flue gas and pulverized coal combustion flue gas are proposed and discussed. Although it is widely accepted that the separation of CO2 from air to high purity is more energy-intensive than separating CO2 from more concentrated sources, this study presents select cases where the separation of CO2 from air to low and moderate purities is energetically equivalent with the work required for flue gas CO2 separation. These energetically-competitive cases are shown to be dependent on the percent capture and final CO2 purity desired. In particular, several technologies can be considered as CO2 utilization opportunities in which dilute CO2 may be an adequate feedstock. Specifically, this study is focused on enhanced oil recovery and microalgae cultivation technologies, which appear to be the most beneficial near-term applications for utilization of CO2 from direct air capture. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",carbon capture; Direct air capture; negative emissions,Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Enhanced recovery; Flue gases; Flues; Oil well flooding; Separation; Source separation; Air captures; CO2 separation; Concentrated source; Enhanced oil recovery; High purity; Microalgae cultivation; Natural gas combined cycles; Pulverized coal combustion; Coal combustion; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; coal combustion; cultivation; enhanced oil recovery; environmental impact; microalga; natural gas; pulverized fuel ash,"Wilcox, J.; Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, United States; эл. почта: wilcox@mines.edu",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021266448

Despite concerns, health data have not been examined alongside CSG development. This study examined hospitalisation rates as a function of CSG development activity in Queensland, during the period 1995–2011. Admissions data were examined with CSG well numbers, which served as a proxy for CSG development activity. Time series models were used to assess changes in hospitalisation rates for periods of “low”, “medium”, “high”, and “intense” activity compared to a period of “very low” activity, adjusting for covariates. “All-cause” hospitalisation rates increased monotonically with increasing gas well development activity in females (324.0 to 390.3 per 1000 persons) and males (294.2 to 335.4 per 1000 persons). Hospitalisation rates for “Blood/immune” conditions generally increased for both sexes. Female and male hospitalisation rates for “Circulatory” conditions decreased with increasing CSG activity. Hospitalisation rates were generally low for reproductive and birth outcomes; no clear associations were observed. This study showed some outcomes were associated with increasing CSG development activity. However, as a condition of data access, the population and outcomes were aggregated to a broad geographic study area rather than using higher geographic resolution data. Higher resolution data, as well as other data sources, should be explored. Further research should be conducted with an expanded time period to determine if these trends continue as the industry grows. © 2017 by the authors.

When the data are compositional, they need to be scaled so that subsequent analysis are scale-invariant, and geometrically this means to force them into the open Simplex. A common practice to analyze compositional data is to map bijectively compositions into the ordinary euclidean space through a suitable transformation, so that standard multivariate analysis techniques can be used. In this paper, the stability analysis of the Centered Log-Ratio (clr) transformation is performed. The purpose is to isolate areas of the Simplex where the clr transformation is ill conditioned and to highlight values for which the clr transformation cannot be accurately computed. Results show that the mapping accuracy is strongly affected by the closeness of the values to their geometric mean, and that in the worst case the clr can amplify the errors by an unbounded factor. © 2016 IEEE.",Compositional data; conditioning; log-ratio transformation; sensitivity,Multivariant analysis; Natural gas conditioning; Centered log-ratio transformations; Compositional data; Information contents; Log-ratio transformations; Multivariate analysis techniques; Numerical stability analysis; sensitivity; Stability analysis; Metadata,,De Pietro G.Dipanda A.Chbeir R.Gallo L.Yetongnon K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781509056989,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

In this context, these NETs are providing a specific service by removing CO2 from the atmosphere, and therefore investors would expect an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return, varying as a function of the quantity of public money involved. Uniquely, BECCS facilities have the possibility to generate both low carbon power and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, but in an energy system characterised by high penetration of intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar power plants, the dispatch load factor of such BECCS facilities may be small relative to their capacity. This has the potential to significantly under utilise these assets for their primary purpose of removing CO2 from the atmosphere. In this study, we present a techno-economic environmental evaluation of BECCS plants with a range of operating efficiencies, considering their full- and part-load operation relative to a national-scale annual CO2 removal target. We find that in all cases, a lower capital cost, lower efficiency BECCS plant is superior to a higher cost, higher efficiency facility from both environmental and economic perspectives. We show that it may be preferable to operate the BECCS facility in base-load fashion, constantly removing CO2 from the atmosphere and dispatching electricity on an as-needed basis. We show that the use of this 'spare capacity' to produce hydrogen for, e.g. injection to a natural gas system for the provision of low carbon heating can add to the overall environmental and economic benefit of such a system. The only point where this hypothesis appears to break down is where the CO2 emissions associated with the biomass supply chain are sufficiently large so as to eliminate the service of CO2 removal. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",BECCS; CO2 capture and storage; negative emissions,Biomass; Climate change; Earnings; Electric load dispatching; Small power plants; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Supply chains; BECCS; Biomass supply chain; Economic perspective; Environmental evaluation; Natural gas systems; Operating efficiency; Part load operation; Wind and solar power; Carbon dioxide; bioenergy; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental technology; operations technology; pollutant removal; power generation; renewable resource; solar power; wind power,"Mac Dowell, N.; Centre for Environmental Policy, United Kingdom; эл. почта: niall@imperial.ac.uk",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018516902

In this regard, the United States' Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recommended periodic leak detection and repair surveys at oil and gas facilities using optical gas imaging technology. This regulation requires an operator to fix all detected leaks within a set time period. Whether such 'find-all-fix-all' policies are effective depends on significant uncertainties in the character of emissions. In this work, we systematically analyze the effect of facility-related and mitigation-related uncertainties on regulation effectiveness. Drawing from multiple publicly-available datasets, we find that: (1) highly-skewed leak-size distributions strongly influence emissions reduction potential; (2) variations in emissions estimates across facilities leads to large variability in mitigation effectiveness; (3) emissions reductions from optical gas imaging-based leak detection programs can range from 15% to over 70%; and (4) while implementation costs are uniformly lower than EPA estimates, benefits from saved gas are highly variable. Combining empirical evidence with model results, we propose four policy options for effective methane mitigation: performance-oriented targets for accelerated emission reductions, flexible policy mechanisms to account for regional variation, technology-agnostic regulations to encourage adoption of the most cost-effective measures, and coordination with other greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce unintended spillover effects. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",energy policy; EPA; GHG emissions; methane; Paris Agreement,Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Emission control; Energy policy; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental technology; Gas industry; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Imaging techniques; Leak detection; Methane; Uncertainty analysis; Cost-effective measures; Emissions reduction; GHG emission; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Implementation cost; Leak detection and repair; Optical gas imaging; Performance-oriented; Gas emissions; data set; emission control; energy policy; environmental legislation; environmental policy; environmental protection; gas industry; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; international agreement; leakage; methane; mitigation; natural gas; spillover effect; uncertainty analysis; United States,"Ravikumar, A.P.; Department of Energy Resources Engineering, 367 Panama Street, United States; эл. почта: arvindr@stanford.edu",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018461181

The biomethane is considered as renewable natural gas which can be derived from organic waste and sewage treatment. In recent past biomethane is emerging as a promising gaseous fuel utilized in a cogeneration or trigeneration power plant. Biomethane usually produced through anaerobic digestion in oxygen-deficient environment where a series of microorganisms convert the complex waste to biogas via liquefaction through a cascade of enzymes. Biomethane produced in anaerobic digester can be utilized for decentralized power generation, and additionally revenue can be gained in the form of a CO2 credits and/or other greenhouse gas emission credits. In the present book chapter, the technical know-how of anaerobic digestion and biocatalyst associated with digester has been depicted. A thorough understanding of the fundamental principles of anaerobic digestion would help to perceive new aspects of bioenergy conversions. The book chapter highlights the concise of biochemistry for biomethane production as well as important major factors involved in the process toward the realization of a stable biomethane-based economy. Successful application of anaerobic digester was found in pilot-scale potential wastewater treatment along with renewable energy production.

These vehicles have directly or indirectly been implicated in a number of road traffic violations as well as road accidents. This study aims to describe the crash characteristics and injury patterns for Qing-qi rickshaw occupants and other road users hit by Qing-qi rickshaw in Karachi, Pakistan. METHODS: An Observational/ Descriptive study was conducted at Accident & Emergency and Orthopaedic Surgery Department, Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre, Karachi Pakistan from July 2014 to June 2015.All patients who came with Qing-qi rickshaw accident in Accident & Emergency (A&E) of JPMC were included. Crash characteristics, details of injuries, injury severity parameters and outcome were documented in detailed interviews. RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty-six rickshaw related injuries were noted in road traffic accidents by Qing-gi rickshaw. Age range was 2-85 (43.5±58.68). 350 injured victims were males and 136 were females. By occupation most victims were laborers and daily wage workers (45%) and students (21%). Overloading of vehicle with more than two passengers was found in (28.5%). The most common cause of injury was collision with a moving vehicle (56%), followed by fall from rickshaw. The most common contributing factor was the overloading of rickshaw and roll over on turning (61%). Injury severity on arrival were mild (49%), moderate were (32%), and severe were (19%).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of SO2 and PM10 were obtained daily for air pollution and classified into two groups: Group I (2006–2007), coal burning years and Group II (2008–2009), natural gas+ coal burning. Groups I and II were divided into two subgroups according to the months of combustion as combustible (November-April) and noncombustible (May-October). The number of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) was recorded between 2006 and 2009. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between Groups I and II for PM10 and SO2 (p&gt;0.05). Within the years, the values of SO2 and PM10 were statistically different between the groups defined by month (p&lt;0.01). The number of patients in the combustible and noncombustible subgroups were found to be different for every 4 years, and the numbers of patients with COPD or asthma were not changed through the years. There was a strong correlation between PM10 and COPD (r=0.59, p&lt;0.01) and a weak correlation between PM10 and asthma (r=0.25, p&gt;0.05). A correlation was found between SO2 and COPD (p&lt;0.01) but not between SO2 and asthma (p&gt;0.05). The number of visits for COPD and asthma was statistically different between combustible and noncombustible subgroups (X2:58.61, p=0.000; X2:34.55, p=0.000, respectively). The r2 values for SO2 and PM10 for COPD patients were 17% and 24%, respectively, in contrast to 8% and 5%, respectivley for asthma patients. CONCLUSION: Air pollution is known to increase respiratory disease occurrences. With decrease in the usage of solid fuel, air pollution could be reduced and may be effective in preventing respiratory diseases. © 2017 by Turkish Thoracic Society.",Air pollution; Asthma; COPD; PM10; Respiratory system disease; SO2,coal; natural gas; sulfur dioxide; adolescent; adult; agitation; air pollution; Article; asthma; breathing muscle; breathing rate; chronic obstructive lung disease; combustion; correlation analysis; cyanosis; emergency care; emergency medicine; human; hypercapnia; ICD-10-CM; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; observational study; oxygen saturation; particulate matter; practice guideline; pulse rate; retrospective study; speech disorder; thorax disease,"Saygın, M.; Süleyman Demirel Üniversitesi Tıp Fakültesi, Turkey; эл. почта: fizyolog@gmail.com",,AVES İbrahim KARA,21492530,,,,English,Turk Thorac J.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042929520

Methods Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze relationships between changes in energy prices and subsequent changes in hospital patient outcomes measures for the years 2008 through 2014. Patient outcomes measures included 30-day acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia mortality rates, and 30-day acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia readmission rates. Energy price data included state average distillate fuel, electricity and natural gas prices, and the US average coal price. All of the price data were converted to 2014 dollars using Consumer Price Index multipliers. Results There was a significant positive association between changes in coal price and both short-term (P = 0.029) and long-term (P = 0.017) changes in the 30-day heart failure mortality rate. There was a similar significant positive association between changes in coal price and both short-term (P <0.001) and long-term (P = 0.002) changes in the 30-day pneumonia mortality rate. Changes in coal prices also were positively associated with long-term changes in the 30-day myocardial infarction readmission rate (P < 0.001). Changes in coal prices (P = 0.20), natural gas prices (P = 0.040), and electricity prices (P = 0.040) were positively associated with long-term changes in the 30-day heart failure readmission rate. Conclusions Changing energy prices are associated with subsequent changes in hospital mortality and readmission measures. In light of these data, we encourage hospital, health system, and health policy leaders to pursue patient-support initiatives, energy conservation programs, and reimbursement policy strategies aimed at mitigating those effects.

Replacing conventional plastics with bio-based plastics (made from renewable feedstocks) is frequently proposed as a way to mitigate these impacts. Comparatively little research has considered the potential for green energy to reduce emissions in this industry. This paper compares two strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. plastics production: using renewable energy or switching to renewable feedstocks. Renewable energy pathways assume all process energy comes from wind power and renewable natural gas derived from landfill gas. Renewable feedstock pathways assume that all commodity thermoplastics will be replaced with polylactic acid (PLA) and bioethylene-based plastics, made using either corn or switchgrass, and powered using either conventional or renewable energy. Corn-based biopolymers produced with conventional energy are the dominant near-term biopolymer option, and can reduce industry-wide GHG emissions by 25%, or 16 million tonnes CO2e/year (mean value). In contrast, switching to renewable energy cuts GHG emissions by 50%-75% (a mean industry-wide reduction of 38 million tonnes CO2e/year). Both strategies increase industry costs by up to $85/tonne plastic (mean result) for renewable energy, and up to $3000 tonne-1 plastic for renewable feedstocks. Overall, switching to renewable energy achieves greater emission reductions, with less uncertainty and lower costs than switching to corn-based biopolymers. In the long run, producing bio-based plastics from advanced feedstocks (e.g. switchgrass) and/or with renewable energy can further reduce emissions, to approximately 0 CO2e/year (mean value). © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Bio-based plastics; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Life cycle assessment; Renewable energy; Renewable feedstocks,Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Elastomers; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Gases; Life cycle; Plants (botany); Plastic products; Plastics; Renewable energy resources; Switching; Wind power; Bio-based; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renewable energies; Renewable feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; biogenic material; commodity; cost analysis; emission; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; industrial production; landfill; life cycle analysis; mitigation; natural gas; plastic; polymer; renewable resource; wind power; United States; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays,"Daniel Posen, I.; Department of Engineering and Public Policy, United States; эл. почта: daniel.posen@utoronto.ca",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037129565

The natural course of such sensitivities can potentially be altered through various types of allergen-specific immunotherapy, including low-dose immunotherapy. The molecular mechanism by which low-dose immunotherapy causes desensitization has not thus far been elucidated. While resting lymphocytes maintain a low cytosolic calcium ion concentration, antigen receptor signaling results in calcium ion influx, predominantly via store-operated calcium channels. We therefore hypothesized that desensitization by low-dose immunotherapy is associated with reduced influx of calcium ions into lymphocytes. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis. Intracellular lymphocytic calcium ion concentrations were assayed in a total of 47 patients, following incubation with picogram amounts of the test allergens, using a cell-permeable calcium-sensing ratiometric fluorescent dye and fluorescence spectroscopy, both at baseline and following successful provocation neutralization treatment with low-dose immunotherapy. Low-dose immunotherapy was associated with a reduction in lymphocytic intracellular calcium ion concentration following treatment of: 23? for metabisulfite sensitivity (p<0.0004); 12? for salicylate sensitivity (p<0.01); 23? for benzoate sensitivity (p<0.01); 30? for formaldehyde sensitivity (p<0.0001); 16?for sensitivity to petrol exhaust (p<0.003); 16? for natural gas sensitivity (p<0.001); 13? for nickel sensitivity (p<0.05); 30? for sensitivity to organophosphates (p<0.01); and 24? for sensitivity to nitrosamines (p<0.05). Low-dose immunotherapy may affect baseline levels of intracellular calcium in lymphocytes, supporting the premise that allergens affect cell signaling in immune cells and provocation neutralization immunotherapy helps to promote more normal immune cell signaling. © 2017 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",allergy; calcium signaling; immunotherapy; lymphocyte activation,"antimony; benzoic acid; bisulfite; calcium ion; gasoline; immunologic agent; lymphocyte antigen receptor; mercury; natural gas; nickel; nitrosamine; organophosphate; salicylic acid; allergen; benzoic acid derivative; calcium; formaldehyde; natural gas; nickel; nitrosamine; organophosphate; salicylic acid derivative; adult; Article; blood sampling; calcium transport; cell membrane permeability; clinical article; cohort analysis; concentration response; controlled study; desensitization; female; fluorescence spectroscopy; follow up; food allergy; human; human cell; human tissue; immunocompetent cell; immunotherapy; low drug dose; lymphocyte; lymphocyte activation; male; provocation; serodiagnosis; signal transduction; clinical trial; environmental disease; exhaust gas; food allergy; lymphocyte; metabolism; multiple chemical sensitivity; Adult; Allergens; Benzoates; Calcium; Desensitization, Immunologic; Environmental Illness; Female; Food Hypersensitivity; Formaldehyde; Humans; Lymphocytes; Male; Multiple Chemical Sensitivity; Natural Gas; Nickel; Nitrosamines; Organophosphates; Salicylates; Vehicle Emissions","Puri, B.K.; Department of Medicine, United Kingdom; эл. почта: basant.puri@imperial.ac.uk",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,15533840,,,28731314.0,English,J.

However, the mean COHb t1/2 of 12 male volunteer smokers was 26.3 minutes at 1.58 ATA and in 12 non-intubated carbon monoxide (CO)-poisoned patients treated at 3 ATA, was 43 minutes. Case report: An 81-year old male, poisoned by an improperly ventilated natural gas heater, was intubated for coma, then treated with HBO2. His PaO2/FiO2 = 283 from aspiration. His initial COHb was 34.4%, and 18 minutes before HBO2, 5.9%. After a compression interval of 17 minutes, the COHb measured after 22 minutes at 3 ATA was 3.3%. Results: By exponential decay, his COHb t1/2 before HBO2 was 95 minutes. We estimate the range for COHb t1/2 during compression as 62-81 minutes and for the 3 ATA interval, 58 to 49 minutes, respectively. The mid-point estimate of COHb t1/2 at 3 ATA was 53 minutes. Conclusions: The COHb t1/2 we calculated is greater than previously reported, but longer in our patient possibly because of concomitant respiratory failure, lung dysfunction, and mechanical ventilation. The often-cited COHb t1/2 of 23 minutes, likely underestimates the actual COHb t1/2 in CO-poisoned patients, especially those with cardiopulmonary dysfunction. © Copyright 2017 Undersea & Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc.",Carbon monoxide poisoning; Carboxyhemoglobin; Elimination; Half-life; Hyperbaric oxygen,"carboxyhemoglobin; carbon monoxide intoxication; case report; half life time; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; male; metabolism; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged, 80 and over; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Carboxyhemoglobin; Half-Life; Humans; Hyperbaric Oxygenation; Male; Treatment Outcome","Weaver, L.K.; LDS Hospital Salt Lake CityUnited States; эл. почта: lindell.Weaver@imail.org",,Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society,10662936,,,28777908.0,English,Undersea Hyperbaric Med.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017604782

Fasting serum concentrations of biochemical parameters were determined with standard methods. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP 1A1 rs4646903, rs1048943, rs4986883, and rs1799814 were genotyped with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFPL), while GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletions were detected with multiplex PCR.

If the chemical signature of fracking is detectable in streams, it can be employed to bookmark potential impacts. We evaluated benthic biofilm community composition as a proxy for stream chemistry so as to segregate anthropogenic signatures in eight Arkansas River catchments. In doing so, we tested the hypothesis that fracking characteristics in study streams are statistically distinguishable from those produced by agriculture or urbanization. Results: Four tributary catchments had UNG-wells significantly more dense and near to our sampling sites and were grouped as 'potentially-impacted catchment zones' (PICZ). Four others were characterized by significantly larger forested area with greater slope and elevation but reduced pasture, and were classified as 'minimally-impacted' (MICZ). Overall, 46 bacterial phyla/141 classes were identified, with 24 phyla (52%) and 54 classes (38%) across all samples. PICZ-sites were ecologically more variable than MICZ-sites, with significantly greater nutrient levels (total nitrogen, total phosphorous), and elevated Cyanobacteria as bioindicators that tracked these conditions. PICZ-sites also exhibited elevated conductance (a correlate of increased ion concentration) and depressed salt-intolerant Spartobacteria, suggesting the presence of brine as a fracking effect. Biofilm communities at PICZ-sites were significantly less variable than those at MICZ-sites. Conclusions: Study streams differed by Group according to morphology, land use, and water chemistry but not in biofilm community structure. Those at PICZ-sites covaried according to anthropogenic impact, and were qualitatively similar to communities found at sites disturbed by fracking. The hypothesis that fracking signatures in study streams are distinguishable from those produced by other anthropogenic effects was statistically rejected. Instead, alterations in biofilm community composition, as induced by fracking, may be less specific than initially predicted, and thus more easily confounded by agriculture and urbanization effects (among others). Study streams must be carefully categorized with regard to the magnitude and extent of anthropogenic impacts. They must also be segregated with statistical confidence (as herein) before fracking impacts are monitored. © 2017 The Author(s).",16S ribosomal RNA; Anthropogenic impacts; Bioindicators; Fayetteville shale; Groundwater; Microbiome,"nitrogen; phosphorus; bacterial DNA; ground water; natural gas; nitrogen; phosphonic acid derivative; phosphorous acid; RNA 16S; water pollutant; agriculture; Arkansas; Artemia; Article; bacterium; bacterium identification; benthos; biofilm; catchment; controlled study; cyanobacterium; forest; fracking; ion conductance; microbial morphology; minimally impacted catchment zone; nonhuman; nutrient concentration; pasture; potentially impacted catchment zone; Spartobacteria; stream (river); urbanization; analysis; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; ecology; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; genetics; geographic mapping; hydrology; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; oil industry; river; water pollutant; water pollution; Agriculture; Arkansas; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Biofilms; DNA, Bacterial; Ecology; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geographic Mapping; Groundwater; Hydraulic Fracking; Hydrology; Microbiota; Natural Gas; Nitrogen; Oil and Gas Industry; Phosphorous Acids; Rivers; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Urbanization; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution","Douglas, M.E.; Department of Biological Sciences, United States; эл. почта: med1@uark.edu",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712180,,,28158975.0,English,BMC Microbiol.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011371111

Despite these concerns, few studies have evaluated the health effects of UNGD. Objectives: We investigated associations between UNGD activity and symptoms in a cross-sectional study in Pennsylvania. Methods: We mailed a self-administered questionnaire to 23,700 adult patients of the Geisinger Clinic. Using standardized and validated questionnaire items, we identified respondents with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), migraine headache, and fatigue symptoms. We created a summary UNGD activity metric that incorporated well phase, location, total depth, daily gas production and inverse distance–squared to patient residences. We used logistic regression, weighted for sampling and response rates, to assess associations between quartiles of UNGD activity and outcomes, both alone and in combination. Results: The response rate was 33%. Of 7,785 study participants, 1,850 (24%) had current CRS symptoms, 1,765 (23%) had migraine headache, and 1,930 (25%) had higher levels of fatigue. Among individuals who met criteria for two or more outcomes, adjusted odds ratios for the highest quartile of UNGD activity compared with the lowest were [OR (95% CI)] 1.49 (0.78, 2.85) for CRS plus migraine, 1.88 (1.08, 3.25) for CRS plus fatigue, 1.95 (1.18, 3.21) for migraine plus fatigue, and 1.84 (1.08, 3.14) for all three outcomes together. Significant associations were also present in some models of single outcomes. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that UNGD is associated with nasal and sinus, migraine headache, and fatigue symptoms in a general population representative sample. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The five key PNG LNG facilities are the LNG Plant near Port Moresby, the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant, a series of production wells, approximately 800 kilometres of pipelines, and Komo Airfield. Construction of PNG LNG facilities started in early 2010. The facilities were completed in 2014, with loading of the first LNG cargo on 25 May 2014. In the production phase, PNG LNG has the capacity to produce around 7.4 million tonnes of LNG per year. During the life of PNG LNG, it is expected that about 250 billion cubic metres of gas will be produced and sold to provide a long-term supply of LNG to customers in Asia. The PNG LNG footprint includes large tracks of high-value sensitive ecosystem. Recognizing the importance of ensuring regeneration in areas temporarily disturbed by construction, the PNG LNG Project instituted a multi-year regeneration monitoring program to track the level of vegetative regrowth occurring on the Pipeline Right of Way (ROW) and other disturbed areas, mainly focusing on the Upstream project areas. The Project’s objectives are to promote regeneration of temporary work areas disturbed during construction and achieve vegetation succession according to established benchmarks. To evaluate this objective, the PNG LNG Project instituted this regeneration monitoring program. The results of this paper focus on the monitoring through 1H2015, and so represent only initial findings to a multi-year regeneration effort.

ExxonMobil PNG Ltd. developed a private-public partnership in order to objectively document potential positive and negative health impacts on local communities during construction and operations. Data were collected for over 50,000 lives at impact and control/comparison locations covering key health and social indicators. This longitudinal monitoring and surveillance effort is a pioneering effort for the oil and gas industry. Key findings will be presented. Methods, Procedures, Process: A public private partnership with the PNG Institute of Medical Research (PNGIMR) was established. Comprehensive household level demographic health surveys were conducted twice a year. Specialty medical surveys including, maternal and child health outcomes, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted disease incidence and prevalence were also conducted. Key social outcomes including changes in wealth status and in and out migration were analyzed. All surveys were conducted using processes and procedures established by the global INDEPTH Network of demographic health surveillance sites (DSS). The PNGLNG DSS is the first private company sponsored effort to be officially approved and recognized by INDEPTH. Results, Observations, Conclusions: A comprehensive monitoring system has been established and changes from pre-project baseline can be observed covering almost 10 years. The pre-project health impact assessment predictions were objectively assessed based on long-term longitudinal household/community data and found to be generally accurate. Construction related socio-economic and demographic changes during construction are documented; however, the ‘stickiness’ of these changes is less certain in some locations. Project in-migration impacts were generally modest and within pre-project predictions. Based on sequential morbidity and mortality surveys, the project potentially accelerated an ongoing epidemiological transition from infectious to non-communicable diseases in some locations. Concerns regarding increases in community level STIs were not documented. The rise of a silent epidemic in tuberculosis, unrelated to HIV infection, has been objectively documented and evidence provided to key public health authorities. Similarly, the objective decline in community level malaria rates is also observed. The difficulty in producing long-term positive maternal and child outcomes is observed. The demographic surveillance system has created the most robust set of longitudinal health data in PNG so that public health officials can make evidence-based decisions. Objective project-related impacts on community health were generally positive and/or neutral. Fears of large-scale negative health impacts were not realized based on longitudinal data and comparison to baseline conditions. Novel/additive: The PNG LNG health surveillance system is a landmark for the oil and gas industry and represents one the largest and most comprehensive longitudinal health monitoring effort ever developed for a private sector project. Sequential objective data with appropriate control/comparison locations are available including comparison to pre-project baseline data. Pre-project health impact assessment predications are largely confirmed. Significant negative project-related health impacts have not been documented. Changes in demography, socio-economics and morbidity/mortality patterns are observed.

The intensity of the working process at these enterprises was shown to be often associated with the persistent exposure to various harmful factors of the occupational environment that in the complex promotes the formation of unfavorable functional states, a decline in the level of physical and mental health, productivity and efficiency of work. Industrial air environment in services workshop and compressor houses is often polluted with hydrogen sulphide, sulfur dioxide, mercaptans, methanol, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, nitrogen and carbon oxides. The main cause of this pollution is a certain imperfection of the technological process and equipment, especially the lack of its tightness. The number of processes at a high temperature and elevated pressure in the presence of very aggressive reagents primarily, as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide promotes the release of harmful substances into air environment. The possibility of their additive or synergistic impact on employees is not excluded because just in such industries there is seen a number of combinations of harmful substances enforcing the action of each other. There is made a conclusion that working conditions and environmental protection at the enterprises for the processing of natural gas and condensate with the high content of hydrogen sulfide and other corrosive components need for the further comprehensive hygienic assessment with the aim of the development of measures for the improvement of working conditions, preservation of workers' health and environmental protection at all stages of production and processing of hydrocarbon raw materials in modern conditions.

Replacing coal with natural gas results in a significant decrease in emissions of greenhouse gases and dusts. The presence of microorganisms may be the cause of underground gas storage (UGS) facilities and pipelines deterioration. Microorganisms and their metabolic products contribute to the formation of sudden and unexpected failure causing loss of energy security by: decline in the quality of stored gas or disruption of its transmission. The paper presents a variety of microbiomes of the underground storage facilities and pipelines, showing that not only the sulfate-reducing bacteria are able to grow and develop in these extreme environments. Microorganisms producing CH4 may change the composition of the gas, and the produced H2S and CO2 are not only gas pollutants, but also generate corrosion of transmission networks.

The purpose of this paper is to enhance the sustainability and energy autonomy of the building. Design/methodology/approach: The building referred to in the case study is a library, and simulations related to the ongoing study are based on an energy audit, comprising a survey on electrical and thermal energy consumption. The innovative proposed model consists of a mix of energy production processes based on photovoltaic panels and biomass boilers. Economic analysis of the energy model has already yielded some results regarding the payback on investment, as well as avoided emissions in the context of development of a low-carbon economy with avoided emissions and socioeconomic advantages. Findings: It is possible to enhance the sustainability of the library studied by the retrofit of the current energy system. With the integration of photovoltaic panels and the conversion or replacement of boilers from natural gas to biomass, the GHG emissions could drop around 121 t CO2 per year. Another benefit would be the inclusion of endogenous resources over imported energy resources. The payback period for the measures proposed ranges from 2.5 to 8 years, proving that the increase in environmental sustainability is viable. Originality/value: The intention here is to implement the concept of smart city, in more sustainable buildings, bringing them to the lowest possible energy consumption levels, hence increasing performance and comfort. Also, taking into account that the energy-consuming buildings are already constructed, it is urgent to reconvert them to lower the use of energy and emissions using technologies based on renewable energy, boosting the use of local resources. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Biomass; Efficiency; Energy audit; Energy model; Photovoltaic; Smart city,,"Galvão, J.R.; R&D Unit, Portugal; эл. почта: jrgalvao@ipleiria.pt",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,14777835,,,,English,Manage.

However, despite its long history and tradition, the scientific value of BT is still the subject of discussion. The aim of this overview was to discuss the current evidence and critical points about the mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of BT in OA as well as the definition of the used term of “Balneotherapy”. BT traditionally involves either immersion in mineral and/or thermal waters from natural springs and/or balneological interventions with natural gases or peloids (mud). The mechanisms of action of BT are not fully elucidated; the net benefit is probably the result of a combination of mechanical, thermal and chemical effects. Various randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in patients with OA support a beneficial effect of BT on pain, function and quality of life that lasts over time after the treatment. Economic evaluations in this field are rare, however preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis have shown a favourable economic profile for BT in OA. Some aspects have to be clarified regarding the absorption of the mineral elements dissolved in waters, their concentration in the joints and the ideal concentration of each element to obtain a therapeutic response. Further well-designed RCTs are needed in order to support the beneficial effects of BT in OA. Additional preclinical and clinical studies are necessary to clarify the mechanisms of action of BT to improve the scientific value of BT. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Balneotherapy; Cost-effectiveness; Knowledge; Mechanisms of action; Osteoarthritis; Randomized controlled trials,mineral; natural gas; water; Article; balneotherapy; clinical effectiveness; cost effectiveness analysis; economic evaluation; evidence based practice; functional status; human; hydrotherapy; medical terminology; mud therapy; multicenter study (topic); natural spring; osteoarthritis; pain; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic),"Fioravanti, A.; Rheumatology Unit, Viale Bracci 1, Italy; эл. почта: fioravanti7@virgilio.it",,Elsevier GmbH,18763820,,,,English,Eur.

We systematically evaluated 1021 chemicals identified in hydraulic-fracturing fluids (n=925), wastewater (n=132), or both (n=36) for potential reproductive and developmental toxicity to triage those with potential for human health impact. We searched the REPROTOX database using Chemical Abstract Service registry numbers for chemicals with available data and evaluated the evidence for adverse reproductive and developmental effects. Next, we determined which chemicals linked to reproductive or developmental toxicity had water quality standards or guidelines. Toxicity information was lacking for 781 (76%) chemicals. Of the remaining 240 substances, evidence suggested reproductive toxicity for 103 (43%), developmental toxicity for 95 (40%), and both for 41 (17%).

Cheyenne Ave, Tulsa, OK  74119, United States","The Marcellus Shale is one of the largest natural gas fields in the world and has been the site of a massive natural gas development effort involving hundreds of oil and gas companies. With the onslaught of the “shale revolution,” developers moved into states like Pennsylvania and began drilling/completing natural gas wells by the hundreds. This development occurred so rapidly that attention to issues such as wellbore natural gas intrusion was not initially given the priority it demanded in all cases. This led to instances of alleged natural gas migration and impacts to groundwater supplies in several areas of the region. Although there has been an onslaught of evaluations geared toward the study of groundwater contamination, the author has researched the natural gas wells themselves. Based on thousands of wellbore integrity studies in the Marcellus and other worldwide shale regions, this paper will summarize the forensic processes, analysis methods, and approaches used in assessing wellbore integrity as part of a natural gas migration investigation. The paper will also present details that pertain to remedial alternatives and approaches to wells requiring attention. © National Academy of Forensic Engineers (NAFE).",Annular pressure; Natural gas migration; Remedial cement squeeze; Shut-in pressure test; Temperature/audio log; Venting rate test; Well integrity; Wellbore natural gas intrusion,Gas industry; Gases; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Natural gas well logging; Natural gasoline plants; Oil field development; Oil field equipment; Oil wells; Public utilities; Shale; Thermal logging; Annular pressures; Natural gas migration; Rate test; Remedial cement squeeze; Shut-in pressure; Wellbore; Natural gas wells,"Daniel Arthur, J.1718 S.

We investigate how increasing commercial CHP penetrations may affect net emissions, the distribution network, and total system energy costs. We constructed an integrated planning and operations model that maximizes owner profit through sizing and operation of CHP on a realistic distribution feeder in New York. We find that a greater penetration of CHP reduces both total system energy costs and network congestion. Commercial buildings often have low and inconsistent heat loads, which can cause low fuel utilization efficiencies, low CHP rates-of-return and diminishing avoided emissions as CHP penetration increases. In the northeast, without policy intervention, a 5% penetration of small commercially owned CHP would increase CO2 emissions by 2% relative to the bulk power grid. Low emission CHP installations can be encouraged with incentives that promote CHP operation only during times of high heat loads. Time-varying rates, such as time-of-day and seasonal rates, are one option and were shown to reduce customer emissions without reducing profits. In contrast, natural gas rate discounts, a common incentive for industrial CHP in some states, can encourage CHP operation during low heat loads and thus increase emissions. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",air emissions; cogeneration; combined heat and power; distributed energy resources; electric generation; microgrid,Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Natural gas; Office buildings; Profitability; Thermal load; Air emissions; cogeneration; Combined heat and power; Distributed Energy Resources; Electric generation; Micro grid; Cogeneration plants; cogeneration; combined heat and power; cost analysis; electricity generation; emission; energy efficiency; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; energy resource; incentive; natural gas; smart grid; New York [United States]; United States; Chandipura virus,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008227544

Study design Ecological study. Methods Data for urinary bladder, thyroid and leukaemia were abstracted from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry (PCR). Cancer incidence among counties with high, moderate and minimal number of producing wells is compared before drilling activity and thereafter. Observed vs expected cases, standardized incidence ratio and 95% confidence intervals are presented. Data are presented by county, diagnosis and sex for the years 2000–2004, 2004–2008 and 2008–2012. The percent difference between the observed cases from 2000 to 2004 and 2008–2012 was calculated. Results The observed number of urinary bladder cases was higher than expected in both sexes in counties with shale gas activity. In counties with the fewest number of producing wells, the increase was essentially non-existent. The number of observed cases of thyroid cancer increased substantially among both sexes over the time period in all counties regardless of the number of wells drilled. The pattern for leukaemia was mixed among males and females and among the counties regardless of the extent of shale gas development activities. Conclusion Potential risk factors other than shale gas development must be taken into account to explain the higher than expected cancer cases in counties with and without shale gas wells before and during unconventional shale gas activity. © 2016 The Royal Society for Public Health",Cancer epidemiology; Cancer incidence; Environmental epidemiology; Hydraulic fracturing; Unconventional shale development,natural gas; shale gas; unclassified drug; blood system disorder; cancer; disease incidence; epidemiology; health impact; hydraulic fracturing; risk factor; shale gas; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; bladder cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer incidence; cancer registry; cancer risk; child; environmental exposure; female; geographic distribution; human; leukemia; male; Pennsylvania; risk assessment; rural area; sex difference; standardization; thyroid cancer; Washington; incidence; leukemia; mining; Neoplasms; register; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Thyroid Neoplasms; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Pennsylvania; United States; Extraction and Processing Industry; Female; Humans; Incidence; Leukemia; Male; Natural Gas; Neoplasms; Pennsylvania; Registries; Risk Factors; Thyroid Neoplasms; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,,,Elsevier B.V.,00333506,,PUHEA,27932001.0,English,Public Health,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84993953253

India has large potential for production of biofuels like biodiesel from vegetable seeds. Use of biodiesel namely, tamanu methyl ester (TME) in unmodified diesel engines leads to low thermal Efficiency and high smoke emission. To encounter this problem hydrogen was inducted by a port fueled injection system. Hydrogen is considered to be low polluting fuel and is the most promising among alternative fuel. Its clean burning characteristic and better performance attract more interest compared to other fuels. It was more active in reducing smoke emission in biodiesel. A main drawback with hydrogen fuel is the increased NOx emission. To reduce NOx emission, TME-ethanol blends were used in various proportions. After a keen study, it was observed that ethanol can be blended with biodiesel up to 30% in unmodified diesel engine. The present work deals with the experimental study of performance and emission characteristic of the DI diesel engine using hydrogen and TME-ethanol blends.

Methods: Townships of Chongfu, Zhouquan, Gaoqiao, Shimen, Wuzhen were randomly selected from Tongxiang. All the local people aged 30-79 years were asked to receive questionnaire survey, physical examination and pulmonary function testing. FEV1max/FVC max≤0.7 was the criterion of COPD diagnosis. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between smoking/indoor air pollution and COPD, multiplied interaction between smoking and indoor air pollution was evaluated, Excel table prepared by Andersson et al. was used to calculate the adding interaction. Results: The overall prevalence of COPD was 6.6%, and adjusted for age, educational level, occupation, marriage, income level, BMI, waist-to-hip and other factors, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that males who had quit smoking, started smoking at age of <25 years had a high risk of COPD; females who smoked every day <15 g, inhaled smoke into mouth or throat had high risk of COPD. Interaction analysis showed that using fuel of firewood/charcoal/coal, briquettes for cooking and regular smoking had multiplied interaction on COPD.

Colborn, a founder of endocrine disruption research, also stimulated study of hydraulic fracturing (fracking). In 2014, the United States led the world in oil and gas production, with fifteen million Americans living within one mile of an oil or gas well. Colborn pioneered efforts to understand and control the impacts of this sea change in energy production. In 2005, her research organization The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX) developed a database of chemicals used in natural gas extraction and their health effects. This database stimulated novel scientific and social scientific research and informed advocacy by (1) connecting communities’ diverse health impacts to chemicals used in natural gas development, (2) inspiring social science research on open-source software and hardware for citizen science, and (3) posing new scientific questions about the endocrine-disrupting properties of fracking chemicals. © The Author(s) 2016.",Endocrine disruption; Environmental health; Environmental justice; Fracking; Trans disciplinary; Unconventional oil and gas,,"Wylie, S.; Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Avenue, 335INV, United States; эл. почта: s.wylie@neu.edu",,SAGE Publications Ltd,10482911,,,,English,New Solut.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042649849

The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), with its rich collection of both coded and free-text variables, has the potential to overcome these limitations. This study used a multipronged approach to identify gas-specific suicides in NVDRS and to track the incidence of these suicides over time. Methods Using suicide cases from the 16 NVDRS states that participated throughout 2005–2012, free-text and code searches were conducted for four types of variables—incident narratives, coroner/medical examiner cause-of-death statements, cause-of-death codes, and substance names—to identify suicides by carbon monoxide, helium, hydrogen sulfide, and four other gases. All analyses were conducted in 2015. Results Approximately 4% (3,242 of 80,715) of suicides recorded in NVDRS over the study period were the result of gas inhalation. Of these, the majority (73%) were carbon monoxide suicides (almost exclusively from motor vehicle exhaust and charcoal burning). Other types of gas (most notably helium), once rare, are now more common: At the start of the study period non–carbon monoxide gas suicides represented 15% of all gas suicides; at the end of the study period, they represented 40%. Conclusions Public health policies to reduce a suicidal person's access to more lethal suicide methods require a reliable source of surveillance data on specific methods used in suicide. Small changes to NVDRS could make it an efficient and nimble surveillance system for tracking these deaths. © 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine",,carbon monoxide; charcoal; helium; hydrogen sulfide; natural gas; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; propane; Article; carbon monoxide intoxication; cause of death; coroner; exhaust gas; gas; human; ICD-10; incidence; information processing; major clinical study; motor vehicle; national violent death reporting system; suicide; toxic inhalation; United States; carbon monoxide intoxication; gas poisoning; statistics and numerical data; suicide; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Gas Poisoning; Humans; Suicide; United States,"Azrael, D.; Harvard Injury Control Research Center, 677 Huntington Avenue, United States; эл. почта: azrael@hsph.harvard.edu",,Elsevier Inc.,07493797,,AJPME,27745610.0,English,Am.

Little has been published about the radon from shale gas to date, making estimates of its impact on radon-induced lung cancer speculative. We measured radon in natural gas pipelines carrying gas from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Radon concentrations ranged from 1,520 to 2,750 Bq/m3 (41–74 pCi/L), and the throughput-weighted average was 1,983 Bq/m3 (54 pCi/L). Potential radon exposure due to the use of Marcellus Shale gas for cooking and space heating using vent-free heaters or gas ranges in northeastern U.S. homes and apartments was assessed. Though the measured radon concentrations are higher than what has been previously reported, it is unlikely that exposure from natural gas cooking would exceed 1.2 Bq/m3 (&lt;1% of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's action level). Using worst-case assumptions, we estimate the excess lifetime (70 years) lung cancer risk associated with cooking to be 1.8×10−4 (interval spanning 95% of simulation results: 8.5×10−5, 3.4×10−4). The risk profile for supplemental heating with unvented gas appliances is similar. Individuals using unvented gas appliances to provide primary heating may face lifetime risks as high as 3.9×10−3. Under current housing stock and gas consumption assumptions, expected levels of residential radon exposure due to unvented combustion of Marcellus Shale natural gas in the Northeast United States do not result in a detectable change in the lung cancer death rates. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis",Combustion; indoor air quality; Marcellus Shale; natural gas; radon,"Air quality; Biological organs; Combustion; Diseases; Environmental Protection Agency; Gas appliances; Housing; Indoor air pollution; Natural gas; Natural gas pipelines; Radon; Risk perception; Shale; Shale gas; Gas consumption; Indoor air quality; Lung cancer risks; Marcellus shales; Radon concentrations; Radon exposure; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Weighted averages; Gases; air quality; cancer; combustion; concentration (composition); health risk; heating; indoor air; mortality; pollution exposure; radon; shale gas; Pennsylvania; United States; West Virginia; natural gas; radon; computer simulation; geography; housing; human; lung tumor; procedures; radiation induced neoplasm; risk assessment; time factor; United States; Computer Simulation; Geography; Housing; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Natural Gas; Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced; New England; Radon; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; United States","Casman, E.A.; Department of Engineering & Public Policy, United States; эл. почта: casman@andrew.cmu.edu",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,02724332,,RIAND,26882276.0,English,Risk Anal.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959153305

Furthermore, it is very difficult to reach the DOE targets for volumetric (350 cm3 [STP] cm−3) and gravimetric (0.5 g [CH4]/g) storage capacities simultaneously for a single MOF. This review systematically evaluates and compares the methane storage capacities of reported MOFs at both 298 and 270 K. We found that slightly reducing the storage temperature to 270 K can significantly improve both the volumetric and gravimetric uptake. Our discoveries highlight that two unique MOFs, NU-111 and MOF-177 (which have high pore volumes of 2.09 and 1.89 cm3 g−1, respectively), not only have very high gravimetric capacities of 0.5 and 0.43 g/g, respectively, but also exhibit the highest working capacities ever reported: 239 and 230 cm3 (STP) cm−3, respectively.

Cooling systems range in their rates of water use, capital investment, and annual costs. Using Texas as a case study, we examined the cost of retrofitting existing coal and natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) power plants with alternative cooling systems, either wet recirculating towers or air-cooled condensers for dry cooling. We applied a power plant assessment tool to model existing power plants in terms of their key plant attributes and site-specific meteorological conditions and then estimated operation characteristics of retrofitted plants and retrofit costs. We determined the anticipated annual reductions in water withdrawals and the cost-per-gallon of water saved by retrofits in both deterministic and probabilistic forms. The results demonstrate that replacing once-through cooling at coal-fired power plants with wet recirculating towers has the lowest cost per reduced water withdrawals, on average. The average marginal cost of water withdrawal savings for dry-cooling retrofits at coal-fired plants is approximately 0.68 cents per gallon, while the marginal recirculating retrofit cost is 0.008 cents per gallon. For NGCC plants, the average marginal costs of water withdrawal savings for dry-cooling and recirculating towers are 1.78 and 0.037 cents per gallon, respectively. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",cooling systems; energy-water nexus; power plant retrofits,Coal; Cooling; Cost reduction; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Investments; Retrofitting; Thermoelectric equipment; Water supply; Air-cooled condensers; Capital investment; Coal-fired power plant; energy-water nexus; Meteorological condition; Natural gas combined cycles; Once-through cooling; Operation characteristic; Cooling systems; assessment method; climate conditions; cooling water; cost analysis; electronic equipment; hydroelectric power plant; investment; natural gas; power generation; resource scarcity; water demand; water supply; water use; Texas; United States,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994708658

Little is known about what geochemical parameters drive microbial population dynamics in biodegraded, methanogenic oil reservoirs. We investigated if microbial community structure was significantly impacted by the extent of crude oil biodegradation, extent of biogenic methane production, and formation water chemistry. Twenty-two oil production wells from north central Louisiana, USA, were sampled for analysis of microbial community structure and fluid geochemistry. Archaea were the dominant microbial community in the majority of the wells sampled. Methanogens, including hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic organisms, were numerically dominant in every well, accounting for, on average, over 98% of the total Archaea present. The dominant Bacteria groups were Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, and Clostridiales, which have also been identified in other microbially-altered oil reservoirs. Comparing microbial community structure to fluid (gas, water, and oil) geochemistry revealed that the relative extent of biodegradation, salinity, and spatial location were the major drivers of microbial diversity. Archaeal relative abundance was independent of the extent of methanogenesis, but closely correlated to the extent of crude oil biodegradation; therefore, microbial community structure is likely not a good sole predictor of methanogenic activity, but may predict the extent of crude oil biodegradation. However, when the shallow, highly biodegraded, low salinity wells were excluded from the statistical analysis, no environmental parameters could explain the differences in microbial community structure. This suggests that the microbial community structure of the 5 shallow, up-dip wells was different than the 17 deeper, down-dip wells. Also, the 17 down-dip wells had statistically similar microbial communities despite significant changes in environmental parameters between oil fields. Together, this implies that no single microbial population is a reliable indicator of a reservoir's ability to degrade crude oil to methane, and that geochemistry may be a more important indicator for selecting a reservoir suitable for microbial enhancement of natural gas generation. ï¿½ 2016 Shelton, Akob, McIntosh, Fierer, Spear, Warwick and McCray.",Gulf Coast Basin; Hydrogeochemical tracers; Methane; Methanogenic crude oil biodegradation; Microbial ecology; Oil field,RNA 16S; Acinetobacter; Article; biodegradation; biomass; Clostridiales; DNA extraction; Enterobacteriaceae; gel electrophoresis; gene sequence; methanogenesis; Methanothermococcus; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial growth; nonhuman; oil field; polymerase chain reaction; Pseudomonas,"Shelton, J.L.; Eastern Energy Resources Science Center, United States; эл. почта: jlshelton@usgs.gov",,Frontiers Media S.A.,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

Reproductive outcomes were categorized as [1] birth outcomes associated with maternal exposure, [2] semen quality, fertility, and birth outcomes associated with adult paternal exposure, [3] reproductive cancers, and [4] disruption of human sex steroid hormone receptors. The results indicate there is moderate evidence for an increased risk of preterm birth, miscarriage, birth defects, decreased semen quality, and prostate cancer. The quality of the evidence is low and/or inadequate for stillbirth, sex ratio, and birth outcomes associated with paternal exposure, and testicular cancer, female reproductive tract cancers, and breast cancer, and the evidence is inconsistent for an increased risk of low birth weight; therefore, no conclusions can be drawn for these health effects. There is ample evidence for disruption of the estrogen, androgen, and progesterone receptors by oil and gas chemicals, which provides a mechanistic rationale for how exposure to oil and gas activities may increase the health risks we have outlined. The results from this systematic review suggest there is a negative impact on human reproduction from exposure to oil and gas activities. Many of the 45 studies reviewed identified potential human health effects. Most of these studies focused on conventional oil and gas activities. Few studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of unconventional oil and gas operations on human health. The impact of unconventional oil and gas activities may be greater than that of conventional activity, given that unconventional activities employ many of the same approaches and use dozens of known endocrine-disrupting chemicals in hydraulic fracturing. © 2016",Birth defects; cancer; endocrine disrupting chemicals; environmental pollution; fracking; hormonal activity; human reproduction; hydraulic fracturing; oil and natural gas; prenatal exposure; preterm birth; semen quality,"androgen receptor; endocrine disruptor; estrogen receptor; natural gas; oil; progesterone receptor; endocrine disruptor; natural gas; petroleum; steroid receptor; adult; birth weight; breast cancer; cancer incidence; childhood cancer; congenital malformation; DNA damage; environmental exposure; female genital tract cancer; fracking; gas mining; health hazard; human; low birth weight; male fertility; male genital tract parameters; maternal exposure; mining; paternal exposure; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; priority journal; prostate cancer; reproduction; reproductive health; Review; sex ratio; sperm morphology; sperm quality; sperm viability; spermatozoon motility; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; systematic review; testis cancer; Abnormalities, Drug-Induced; adverse effects; chemically induced; drug effects; female; female genital tract tumor; fertility; infertility; male; male genital tract tumor; metabolism; oil and gas field; oil industry; pathology; pathophysiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prenatal exposure; reproduction; risk assessment; risk factor; spermatozoon; tumor cell line; Abnormalities, Drug-Induced; Cell Line, Tumor; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fertility; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Genital Neoplasms, Male; Humans; Hydraulic Fracking; Infertility; Male; Maternal Exposure; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Oil and Gas Industry; Paternal Exposure; Petroleum; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Receptors, Steroid; Reproduction; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Spermatozoa","Nagel, S.C.; Obstetrics, M659 Medical Sciences Building, 1 Hospital Drive, United States; эл. почта: nagels@health.missouri.edu",,Elsevier Inc.,00150282,,FESTA,27568524.0,English,Fertil.

Many chemicals are in commonly used personal care products, linings of food containers, pesticides, and toys, as well as in discarded electronic waste, textile treatments, and indoor and outdoor air and soil. They travel across borders through trade, food, wind, and water. Reproductive and other health effects can be incurred by exposures in utero, in the neonatal or adolescent periods, or in adulthood and can have transgenerational effects. Most chemicals do not undergo the level of evaluation for harm that pharmaceuticals, e.g., do, and they are rarely seen or seriously considered as a danger to human health. Herein, the burden of exposures, challenges in assessing data and populations at risk, models for evaluating harm, and mechanisms of effects are briefly reviewed, ending with a call to action for reproductive health care professionals to advocate for further research, education, and chemical policy reform for the health of this and future generations. © 2016 American Society for Reproductive Medicine",endocrine disrupting chemicals; environmental toxicants; Reproduction,"endocrine disruptor; environmental chemical; endocrine disruptor; pollutant; air pollution; Article; environmental exposure; environmental health; human; nonhuman; priority journal; reproduction; reproductive health; reproductive toxicity; Abnormalities, Drug-Induced; adverse effects; chemically induced; drug effects; female; fertility; infertility; male; maternal exposure; paternal exposure; pathophysiology; pollutant; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; risk assessment; risk factor; Abnormalities, Drug-Induced; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fertility; Humans; Infertility; Male; Maternal Exposure; Paternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Reproduction; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors","Giudice, L.C.; Department of Obstetrics, United States; эл. почта: linda.giudice@ucsf.edu",,Elsevier Inc.,00150282,,FESTA,27545021.0,English,Fertil.

Toward this need the fresh water consumed for energy production was mapped for almost 12 000 watersheds distributed across the 21-economies comprising the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Fresh water consumption was estimated for ten different sectors including thermoelectric and hydroelectric power; energy extraction including coal, oil, natural gas, uranium and unconventional oil/gas; energy processing including oil and biofuels; and biofuel feedstock irrigation. These measures of water consumption were put in context by drawing comparison with published measures of water risk. In total 791 watersheds (32%) of the 2511 watersheds where energy related water consumption occurred were also characterized by high to extreme water risk, these watersheds were designated as being at energy-water risk.

Herein, we describe solvent- and catalyst-free synthesis of ultramicroporous benzothiazole polymers (BTAPs) in the presence of elemental sulfur in quantitative yields. BTAPs were found to be highly porous and showed exceptional physiochemical stability. Moreover, in situ chemical impregnation of sulfur within the micropores increased CO2 affinity of the sorbent while limiting diffusion of CH4. As low-cost, scalable solid sorbents, BTAPs showed promising CO2 separation ability and high regenerability under vacuum swing adsorption for the simulated flue gas, natural gas, and landfill gas conditions. The fact that elemental sulfur can be directly utilized in the synthesis of BTAPs means that it can be recycled back to the natural gas sweetening process for efficient CO2/CH4 separation, thus offering a high-value, scalable, large-scale application for elemental sulfur. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",benzothiazole polymers; carbon dioxide capture; elemental sulfur; landfill gas separation; microporous polymers,,"Coskun, A.; Graduate School of Energy, Yuseong-gu, South Korea; эл. почта: coskun@kaist.ac.kr",,Elsevier Inc,24519294,,,,English,Chem,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008249105

Unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) has community and environmental impacts. In Pennsylvania, UNGD began in 2005, and by 2012, 6253 wells had been drilled. There are no prior studies of UNGD and Objective respiratory outcomes. Objective To evaluate associations between UNGD and asthma exacerbations. DESIGN A nested case-control study comparing patients with asthma with and without exacerbations from 2005 through 2012 treated at the Geisinger Clinic, which provides primary care services to over 400 000 patients in Pennsylvania. Patients with asthma aged 5 to 90 years (n = 35 508) were identified in electronic health records; those with exacerbations were frequency matched on age, sex, and year of event to those without. EXPOSURES On the day before each patient's index date (cases, date of event or medication order; controls, contact date), we estimated activity metrics for 4 UNGD phases (pad preparation, drilling, stimulation [hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking""], and production) using distance from the patient's home to the well, well characteristics, and the dates and durations of phases. Main Outcomes and Measures We identified and defined asthma exacerbations as mild (new oral corticosteroid medication order), moderate (emergency department encounter), or severe (hospitalization). RESULTS We identified 20 749 mild, 1870 moderate, and 4782 severe asthma exacerbations, and frequency matched these to 18 693, 9350, and 14 104 control index dates, respectively. In 3-level adjusted models, there was an association between the highest group of the activity metric for each UNGD phase compared with the lowest group for 11 of 12 UNGD-outcome pairs: odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.7) for the association of the pad metric with severe exacerbations to 4.4 (95% CI, 3.8-5.2) for the association of the production metric with mild exacerbations. Six of the 12 UNGD-outcome associations had increasing ORs across quartiles. Our findings were robust to increasing levels of covariate control and in sensitivity analyses that included evaluation of some possible sources of unmeasured confounding. Conclusions and Relevance Residential UNGD activity metrics were statistically associated with increased risk of mild, moderate, and severe asthma exacerbations. Whether these associations are causal awaits further investigation, including more detailed exposure assessment. © 2016 American Medical Association.

They are tied together by the coherence phenomenon, where each has its own frequencies and identifiable EMF; therefore, they can be correlated. The diagnosis of chemical sensitivity can be done accurately in a less polluted, controlled environment, as was done in these studies. The principles of diagnosis and treatment depend on total environmental and total body pollutant loads, masking or adaptation, bipolarity of response, and biochemical individuality, among others. These principles make less polluted, controlled conditions necessary. The clinician has to use less polluted water and organic food with individual challenges for testing, including dust, mold, pesticide, natural gas, formaldehyde, particulates, and EMF testing, which needs to be performed in less polluted copper screened rooms. The challenge tests for proof of chemical sensitivity include inhaled toxics within a clean booth that is chemical and particulate free at ambient doses in parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb). Individual foods, both organic and commercial (that are contaminated with herbicides and pesticides), are used orally. Water testing and intradermal testing are performed in a less polluted, controlled environment. These include specific dose injections of molds, dust, and pollen that are preservative free, individual organic foods, and individual chemicals, i.e. methane, ethane, propane, butane, hexane, formaldehyde, ethanol, car exhaust, jet fuel exhaust, and prosthetic implants (metal plates, pacemakers, mesh, etc.). Normal saline is used as a placebo. EMF testing is performed in a copper screened room using a frequency generator.

Setback distances are a legislative method to mitigate potential risks. Objectives: We attempted to determine whether legal setback distances between well-pad sites and the public are adequate in three shale plays. Methods: We reviewed geography, current statutes and regulations, evacuations, thermal modeling, air pollution studies, and vapor cloud modeling within the Marcellus, Barnett, and Niobrara Shale Plays. Discussion: The evidence suggests that presently utilized setbacks may leave the public vulnerable to explosions, radiant heat, toxic gas clouds, and air pollution from hydraulic fracturing activities. Conclusions: Our results suggest that setbacks may not be sufficient to reduce potential threats to human health in areas where hydraulic fracturing occurs. It is more likely that a combination of reasonable setbacks with controls for other sources of pollution associated with the process will be required. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

As an alternative to chemical catalysis, the main components of the syngas (CO, CO2, and H2) can be used as substrates by a wide range of microorganisms, to be converted into gas biofuels, including methane. This study evaluates the carboxydotrophic (CO-consuming) methanogenic potential present in an anaerobic sludge from an upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor treating waste water, and elucidates the CO conversion routes to methane at 35 ± 3°C. Kinetic activity tests under CO at partial pressures (pCO) varying from 0.1 to 1.5 atm (0.09-1.31 mmol/L in the liquid phase) showed a significant carboxydotrophic activity potential for growing conditions on CO alone. A maximum methanogenic activity of 1 mmol CH4 per g of volatile suspended solid and per day was achieved at 0.2 atm of CO (0.17 mmol/L), and then the rate decreased with the amount of CO supplied. The intermediary metabolites such as acetate, H2, and propionate started to accumulate at higher CO concentrations. Inhibition experiments with 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BES), fluoroacetate, and vancomycin showed that in a mixed culture CO was converted mainly to acetate by acetogenic bacteria, which was further transformed to methane by acetoclastic methanogens, while direct methanogenic CO conversion was negligible. Methanogenesis was totally blocked at high pCO in the bottles (≥ 1 atm). However it was possible to achieve higher methanogenic potential under a 100% CO atmosphere after acclimation of the sludge to CO. This adaptation to high CO concentrations led to a shift in the archaeal population, then dominated by hydrogen-utilizing methanogens, which were able to take over acetoclastic methanogens, while syntrophic acetate oxidizing (SAO) bacteria oxidized acetate into CO2 and H2. The disaggregation of the granular sludge showed a negative impact on their methanogenic activity, confirming that the acetoclastic methanogens were the most sensitive to CO, and a contrario, the advantage of using granular sludge for further development toward large-scale methane production from CO-rich syngas. © 2016 Sancho Navarro, Cimpoia, Bruant and Guiot.",Anaerobic; Carbon monoxide; Carboxydotrophic methanogenesis; Methanation; Syngas; Syntrophic acetate oxidation,carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; cyanide; fluoroacetic acid; hydrogen; vancomycin; Article; bacterial kinetics; bacterial metabolism; biomass conversion; carbon dioxide tension; carboxydotrophic activity; controlled study; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; gas analysis; gas chromatography; genetic analysis; methanogenesis; Methanosaetaceae; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; sludge; upflow reactor,"Guiot, S.R.; Bioengineering Group, Canada; эл. почта: serge.guiot@canada.ca",,Frontiers Research Foundation,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

It is often argued that this phenomenon is caused by an inadequate inclusion of relevant public values in the design of technology. In this paper we examine the applicability of the value sensitive design (VSD) approach. While VSD was primarily introduced for incorporating values in technological design, our focus in this paper is expanded towards the design of the institutions surrounding these technologies, as well as the design of stakeholder participation. One important methodological challenge of VSD is to identify the relevant values related to new technological developments. In this paper, we argue that the public debate can form a rich source from which to retrieve the values at stake. To demonstrate this, we have examined the arguments used in the public debate regarding the exploration and exploitation of shale gas in the Netherlands. We identified two important sets of the underlying values, namely substantive and procedural values. This paper concludes with two key findings. Firstly, contrary to what is often suggested in the literature, both proponents and opponents seem to endorse the same values. Secondly, contestation seems to arise in the precise operationalization of these values among the different stakeholders. In other words, contestation in the Dutch shale gas debate does not arise from inter-value conflict but rather from intra-value conflicts. This multi-interpretability should be incorporated in VSD processes. © 2015, The Author(s).",Energy policy; Public values; Responsible innovation; Shale gas; Value sensitive design,natural gas; equipment design; ethics; Netherlands; standards; technology; Equipment Design; Natural Gas; Netherlands; Technology,"Dignum, M.; Department of Values, Netherlands; эл. почта: m.dignum@tudelft.nl",,Springer Netherlands,13533452,,,26208574.0,English,Sci.

HVHF can negatively affect the environment by contaminating soil, water, and air matrices with potential pollutants. Due to the relatively novel nature of the process, hazards to surface waters and human health are not well known. The purpose of this article is to link the impacts of HVHF operations on surface water integrity, with human health consequences. Surface water contamination risks include: increased structural failure rates of unconventional wells, issues with wastewater treatment, and accidental discharge of contaminated fluids. Human health risks associated with exposure to surface water contaminated with HVHF chemicals include increased cancer risk and turbidity of water, leading to increased pathogen survival time.

NH3 can be regarded as the simplest amine and shares many similarities with other amines when used for CO2 capture. However, NH3 and amines have pronounced operational and technical differences. Compared with other amine-based absorbents, aqueous NH3 is a cheap, robust solvent that does not degrade in the capture processes and has a high CO2 absorption capacity and low regeneration energy. It can also capture multiple flue-gas components (NOX, SO2, and CO2), producing value-added chemicals, such as ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate, which are commonly used as fertilizers. These benefits have inspired intensive research over the past decade to understand the fundamental and practical aspects of the aqueous NH3-based capture processes, as well as assess their technical and economic feasibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between household fuel use and cardiovascular disease mortality. Methods and Results - The Golestan Cohort Study in northeastern Iran enrolled 50 045 individuals 40 to 75 years of age between 2004 and 2008 and collected data on lifetime household fuel use and other baseline exposures. Participants were followed up through 2012 with a 99% successful follow-up rate. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to calculate hazard ratios for associations between pehen (local dung), wood, kerosene/diesel, or natural gas burning for cooking and heating and all-cause and cause-specific mortality, with adjustment for lifetime exposure to each of these fuels and potential confounders. A total of 3073 participants (6%) died during follow-up; 78% of these deaths were attributable to noncommunicable diseases, including cardiovascular, oncological, and respiratory illnesses. Adjusted 10-year hazard ratios from kerosene/diesel burning were 1.06 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.10) and 1.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.17) for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. Subtype-specific analyses revealed a significant increase in ischemic heart disease (10-year hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.21) and a trend toward cerebrovascular accident (10-year hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.17) mortality. Stratification by sex revealed a potential signal for increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality among women compared with men, with similar risk for ischemic heart disease mortality. Conclusions - Household exposure to high-pollution fuels was associated with increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. Replicating these results worldwide would support efforts to reduce such exposures. © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.",air pollution; epidemiology; heart diseases; mortality; stroke,diesel fuel; fuel; kerosene; natural gas; air pollutant; fuel oil; adult; aged; air pollution; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; cooking; environmental exposure; female; follow up; heating; household; human; Iran; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neoplasm; non communicable disease; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; adverse effects; air pollutant; analysis; Cardiovascular Diseases; mortality; risk factor; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fuel Oils; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors,"Mitter, S.S.; Department of Medicine, 676 N St. Clair St, United States; эл. почта: sumeet.mitter@northwestern.edu",,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,00097322,,CIRCA,27297340.0,English,Circulation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974801249

Empirical investigations have focused on the identification and measurement of oil and gas air pollutants [e.g. volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), methane] and the influence of UOG on local and regional ambient air quality (e.g. Tropospheric ozone). While more studies to better characterize spatial and temporal trends in exposure among children and newborns near UOG sites are needed, existing research suggests that exposure to air pollutants emitted during lifecycle operations can potentially lead to adverse respiratory outcomes in this population. Children are known to be at a greater risk from exposure to air pollutants, which can impair lung function and neurodevelopment, or exacerbate existing conditions, such as asthma, because the respiratory system is particularly vulnerable during development in-utero, the postnatal period, and early childhood. In this article, we review the literature relevant to respiratory risks of UOG on infants and children. Existing epidemiology studies document the impact of air pollutant exposure on children in other contexts and suggest impacts near UOG. Research is sparse on long-term health risks associated with frequent acute exposures-especially in children-hence our interpretation of these findings may be conservative. Many data gaps remain, but existing data support precautionary measures to protect the health of infants and children. © 2016 by De Gruyter.",Benzene; Formaldehyde; Ozone; Particulate matter; Silica dust; UOG,air pollutant; natural gas; adverse effects; air pollutant; air pollution; child; environmental exposure; environmental policy; human; infant; oil industry; Respiratory Tract Diseases; risk assessment; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Policy; Humans; Infant; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Industry; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Risk Assessment; United States,"Webb, E.; Center for Environmental Health, 42 Broadway, United States; эл. почта: ellen@ceh.org",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,00487554,,REVHA,27171386.0,English,Rev.

We provide an overview of this protocol and 2012 olfactory exam findings. Of the 1818 NHANES participants aged ≥40 years, 1281 (70.5 %) completed the exam; non-participation mostly was due to time constraints. Health technicians administered an 8-item, forced-choice, odor identification task scored as normosmic (6–8 odors identified correctly) versus olfactory dysfunction, including hyposmic (4–5 correct) and anosmic/severe hyposmic (0–3 correct). Interviewers recorded self-reported smell alterations (during past year, since age 25, phantosmia), histories of sinonasal problems, xerostomia, dental extractions, head or facial trauma, and chemosensory-related treatment and changes in quality of life. Olfactory dysfunction was found in 12.4 % (13.3 million adults; 55 % males/45 % females) including 3.2 % anosmic/severe hyposmic (3.4 million; 74 % males/26 % females). Selected age-specific prevalences were 4.2 % (40–49 years), 12.7 % (60–69 years), and 39.4 % (80+ years). Among adults ≥70 years, misidentification rates for warning odors were 20.3 % for smoke and 31.3 % for natural gas. The highest sensitivity (correctly identifying dysfunction) and specificity (correctly identifying normosmia) of self-reported olfactory alteration was among anosmics/severe hyposmics (54.4 % and 78.1 %, respectively). In age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression analysis, risk factors of olfactory dysfunction were racial/ethnic minority, income-to-poverty ratio ≤ 1.1, education <high school, and heavy drinking. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity reduced risk of impairment. Olfactory dysfunction is prevalent, particularly among older adults. Inexpensive, brief odor identification tests coupled with questions (smell problems past year, since age 25, phantosmia) could screen for marked dysfunction.

Using time series of C2H6 total columns derived from ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) observations made at five selected Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change sites, we characterize the recent C2H6 evolution and determine growth rates of ∼5% yr-1 at mid-latitudes and of ∼3% yr-1 at remote sites. Results from CAM-chem simulations with the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollutants, Phase II bottom-up inventory for anthropogenic emissions are found to greatly underestimate the current C2H6 abundances. Doubling global emissions is required to reconcile the simulations and the observations prior to 2009. We further estimate that North American anthropogenic C2H6 emissions have increased from 1.6 Tg yr-1 in 2008 to 2.8 Tg yr-1 in 2014, i.e. by 75% over these six years. We also completed a second simulation with new top-down emissions of C2H6 from North American oil and gas activities, biofuel consumption and biomass burning, inferred from space-borne observations of methane (CH4) from Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite. In this simulation, GEOS-Chem is able to reproduce FTIR measurements at the mid-latitudinal sites, underscoring the impact of the North American oil and gas development on the current C2H6 abundance. Finally we estimate that the North American oil and gas emissions of CH4, a major greenhouse gas, grew from 20 to 35 Tg yr-1 over the period 2008-2014, in association with the recent C2H6 rise. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",atmospheric ethane and methane; North American anthropogenic emissions; shale gas and tight oil reservoirs; trend,Atmospheric composition; Ethane; Fourier series; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Oil shale; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Shale; Shale gas; Shale oil; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric abundance; Fourier transform infrared; Greenhouse gases observing satellites; Northern Hemispheres; Oil and gas activities; Oil reservoirs; trend; Gas emissions; atmospheric gas; emission inventory; EOS; ethane; exploitation; greenhouse gas; growth rate; hydrocarbon exploration; industrial development; industrial emission; methane; Northern Hemisphere; oil field; shale gas; time series analysis; North America,"Franco, B.; Institute of Astrophysics and Geophysics, Lìge, Belgium; эл. почта: bruno.franco@ulg.ac.be",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964770435

A look at the technologies available in Iran makes it evident that pipelines are the best and safest way for the country to carry and distribute natural gas. This energy resource, which is sometimes referred to as clean fuel, plays a strategic role in providing required energy. On the other hand, this fuel must be supplied in a continuous and yet safe manner. Hence, we arrive to the conclusion that appropriate measures are needed to be taken to manage the risks involved in leakage, firing and explosion in these facilities. To meet the goal, it is very necessary to probe into the reasons of catastrophes and examine reliability issues. Also, it is inevitable for us to estimate the likelihood of catastrophes in these pipelines. One of the essential steps of risk evaluation process is to estimate the likelihood of potential catastrophes. This paper adopts FTA methodology to study the process of catastrophes likelihood estimation in natural gas pipelines. Also, a novel method is provided here which is based on assigning weights to fault tree and “What-if” scenario is used to identify the hazards involved in carrying natural gas from its main source.

Data were collected via telephone interviews and measurements inside and outside of 352 homes. Passive samplers measured time-resolved CO and time-integrated NOX, NO2, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde over ~6-day periods in November 2011 - April 2012 and October 2012 - March 2013. The fraction of indoor NOX and NO2 attributable to indoor sources was estimated. NOX, NO2, and highest 1-h CO were higher in homes that cooked with gas and increased with amount of gas cooking. NOX and NO2 were higher in homes with cooktop pilot burners, relative to gas cooking without pilots. Homes with a pilot burner on a floor or wall furnace had higher kitchen and bedroom NOX and NO2 compared to homes without a furnace pilot. When scaled to account for varying home size and mixing volume, indoor-attributed bedroom and kitchen NOX and kitchen NO2 were not higher in homes with wall or floor furnace pilot burners, although bedroom NO2 was higher. In homes that cooked 4 h or more with gas, self-reported use of kitchen exhaust was associated with lower NOX, NO2, and highest 1-h CO.

However, dedicated compressed natural gas (CNG) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) already exceed future CAFE fuel economy targets because only 15% of non-petroleum energy use is accounted for when determining compliance. This study aims to inform stakeholders about the potential impact of CAFE on life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, should non-petroleum fuel vehicles displace increasingly fuel efficient petroleum vehicles. The well-to-wheel GHG emissions of a set of hypothetical model year 2025 light-duty vehicles are estimated. A reference gasoline vehicle is designed to meet the 2025 fuel economy target within CAFE, and is compared to a set of dedicated CNG vehicles and BEVs with different fuel economy ratings, but all vehicles meet or exceed the fuel economy target due to the policy's dedicated non-petroleum fuel vehicle incentives. Ownership costs and BEV driving ranges are estimated to provide context, as these can influence automaker and consumer decisions. The results show that CNG vehicles that have lower ownership costs than gasoline vehicles and BEVs with long distance driving ranges can exceed the 2025 CAFE fuel economy target. However, this could lead to lower efficiency CNG vehicles and heavier BEVs that have higher well-to-wheel GHG emissions than gasoline vehicles on a per km basis, even if the non-petroleum energy source is less carbon intensive on an energy equivalent basis. These changes could influence the effectiveness of low carbon fuel standards and are not precluded by the light-duty vehicle GHG emissions standards, which regulate tailpipe but not fuel production emissions. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",CAFE; greenhouse gas emissions; life cycle assessment; light-duty vehicles; non-petroleum fuels,Battery electric vehicles; Compressed natural gas; Crashworthiness; Electric automobiles; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Natural gas vehicles; Standards; Vehicle wheels; Vehicles; Wheels; CAFE; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Corporate average fuel-economy standards; Hypothetical models; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Light duty vehicles; Petroleum fuels; Vehicle fuel economy; Fuel economy; carbon; design; electric vehicle; emission control; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy resource; environmental economics; fuel; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; incentive; life cycle analysis; natural gas; ownership; stakeholder; sustainability,"Luk, J.M.; Department of Civil Engineering, 35 St. George Street, Canada; эл. почта: jason.luk@utoronto.ca",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964741424

This work introduces and analyzes a novel concept for flared gas utilization, wherein the gas that would have been flared is instead used to condense atmospheric moisture. Natural gas, which is currently being flared, can alternatively power refrigeration systems to generate the cooling capacity for large scale atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). This approach solves two pressing issues faced by the oil-gas industry, namely gas flaring, and sourcing water for oilfield operations like hydraulic fracturing, drilling and water flooding. Multiple technical pathways to harvest atmospheric moisture by using the energy of natural gas are analyzed. A modeling framework is developed to quantify the dependence of water harvest rates on flared gas volumes and ambient weather. Flaring patterns in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas and the Bakken Shale in North Dakota are analyzed to quantify the benefits of AWH. Overall, the gas currently flared annually in Texas and North Dakota can harvest enough water to meet 11% and 65% of the water consumption in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, respectively. Daily harvests of upto 30 000 and 18 000 gallons water can be achieved using the gas currently flared per well in Texas and North Dakota, respectively. In fifty Bakken sites, the water required for fracturing or drilling a new well can be met via onsite flared gas-based AWH in only 3 weeks, and 3 days, respectively. The benefits of this concept are quantified for the Eagle Ford and Bakken Shales. Assessments of the global potential of this concept are presented using data from countries with high flaring activity. It is seen that this waste-to-value conversion concept offers significant economic benefits while addressing critical environmental issues pertaining to oil-gas production. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",atmospheric water harvesting; Bakken; Eagle Ford; flaring; hydraulic fracturing; refrigeration; water,Cooling systems; Environmental protection; Gas industry; Gases; Harvesting; Hydraulic fracturing; Moisture; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Natural gas well drilling; Oil fields; Oil well flooding; Refrigeration; Runoff; Shale; Water; Water conservation; Water supply; Well flooding; Atmospheric moisture; Atmospheric water; Bakken; Eagle Ford; Environmental issues; flaring; Oilfield operations; Refrigeration system; Well drilling,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961967583

The traditional fuels used in traditional kilns include coal, oil, petroleum coke, and natural gas. Energy costs and environmental concerns have encouraged cement companies worldwide to evaluate to what extent conventional fuels can be replaced by waste materials, such as waste oils, mixtures of non-recycled plastics and paper, used tires, biomass wastes, and even wastewater sludge. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The work is based on literature review. Findings – The clinker firing process is well suited for various alternative fuels (AF); the goal is to optimize process control and alternative fuel consumption while maintaining clinker product quality. The potential is enormous since the global cement industry produces about 3.5 billion tons that consume nearly 350 million tons of coal-equivalent fossil and AF. This study has shown that several cement plants have replaced part of the fossil fuel used by AF, such waste recovered fuels. Many years of industrial experience have shown that the use of wastes as AF by cement plants is both ecologically and economically justified. Originality/value – The substitution of fossil fuels by AF in the production of cement clinker is of great importance both for cement producers and for society because it conserves fossil fuel reserves and, in the case of biogenic wastes, reduces greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the use of AF can help to reduce the costs of cement production. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Alternative fuels; Cement industry; Cement production; Municipal and industrial waste; Raw materials; Waste derived fuels,,"Psomopoulos, C.S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Greece; эл. почта: cpsomop@teipir.gr",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,14777835,,,,English,Manage.

Five real plants in Italy were considered, using maize silage, slurry, and tomato waste as feedstocks and cogenerating electricity and heat; the latter is not utilized. The results suggest that maize silage and the operation of anaerobic digesters, including open storage of digestate, are the main contributors to the impacts of biogas electricity. The system that uses animal slurry is the best option, except for the marine and terrestrial ecotoxicity. The results also suggest that it is environmentally better to have smaller plants using slurry and waste rather than bigger installations, which require maize silage to operate efficiently. Electricity from biogas is environmentally more sustainable than grid electricity for seven out of 11 impacts considered. However, in comparison with natural gas, biogas electricity is worse for seven out of 11 impacts. It also has mostly higher impacts than other renewables, with a few exceptions, notably solar photovoltaics. Thus, for the AD systems and mesophilic operating conditions considered in this study, biogas electricity can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to a fossil-intensive electricity mix; however, some other impacts increase. If mitigation of climate change is the main aim, other renewables have a greater potential to reduce GHG emissions. If, in addition to this, other impacts are considered, then hydro, wind, and geothermal power are better alternatives to biogas electricity. However, utilization of heat would improve significantly its environmental sustainability, particularly global warming potential, summer smog, and the depletion of abiotic resources and the ozone layer. Further improvements can be achieved by banning open digestate storage to prevent methane emissions and regulating digestate spreading onto land to minimize emissions of ammonia and related environmental impacts. © 2016 Fusi, Bacenetti, Fiala and Azapagic.",Agricultural waste; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Electricity; Life cycle assessment; Renewable energy,,"Azapagic, A.; Sustainable Industrial Systems, United Kingdom; эл. почта: adisa.azapagic@manchester.ac.uk",,Frontiers Media S.A.,22964185,,,,English,Front.

The present review is an attempt to assess the influence of non-smoking risk factors on COPD and its measures in Indian subcontinent. The most noteworthy factors among non-smokers appear to be the use of biomass fuel for cooking and heating purposes. We observed that the studies undertaken to evaluate the role of such risk factors are inconclusive due to weak methodologies and small sample sizes, may be due to limited financial resources.

The costbenefit case study results provide insight into which factors enable higher net construction spending when considering a green energy retrofit project. Both the regression model and the case study model focused on the tenant who rents medical office space using a triple net lease. The tenant paradigm limits the analysis to energy savings, the tax implications of having these savings and benefits associated with borrowing when financing the green retrofit.

Recent technological developments in the process of horizontal hydraulic fracturing (hydrofracturing or fracking) have suddenly made it economically feasible to extract natural gas from shale. While natural gas is a much cleaner burning fuel than coal, there are a number of significant threats to human health from the extraction process as currently practiced. There are immediate threats to health resulting from air pollution from volatile organic compounds, which contain carcinogens such as benzene and ethyl-benzene, and which have adverse neurologic and respiratory effects. Hydrogen sulfide, a component of natural gas, is a potent neuro- and respiratory toxin. In addition, levels of formaldehyde are elevated around fracking sites due to truck traffic and conversion of methane to formaldehyde by sunlight. There are major concerns about water contamination because the chemicals used can get into both ground and surface water. Much of the produced water (up to 40% of what is injected) comes back out of the gas well with significant radioactivity because radium in subsurface rock is relatively water soluble. There are significant long-term threats beyond cancer, including exacerbation of climate change due to the release of methane into the atmosphere, and increased earthquake activity due to disruption of subsurface tectonic plates. While fracking for natural gas has significant economic benefits, and while natural gas is theoretically a better fossil fuel as compared to coal and oil, current fracking practices pose significant adverse health effects to workers and near-by residents.

Although these technologies have dramatically increased domestic oil and natural gas production, they have also raised concerns for the potential contamination of local water supplies with the approximately 1,000 chemicals that are used throughout the process, including many known or suspected endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Objectives: We discuss the need for an endocrine component to health assessments for drillingdense regions in the context of hormonal and antihormonal activities for chemicals used. Methods: We discuss the literature on a) surface and groundwater contamination by oil and gas extraction operations, and b) potential human exposure, particularly in the context of the total hormonal and antihormonal activities present in surface and groundwater from natural and anthropogenic sources; we also discuss initial analytical results and critical knowledge gaps. Discussion: In light of the potential for environmental release of oil and gas chemicals that can disrupt hormone receptor systems, we recommend methods for assessing complex hormonally active environmental mixtures. Conclusions: We describe a need for an endocrine-centric component for overall health assessments and provide information supporting the idea that using such a component will help explain reported adverse health trends as well as help develop recommendations for environmental impact assessments and monitoring programs. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Residents and other interest groups have voiced concerns about the potential environmental and health impacts related to CSG. This paper compares objective health outcomes from three study areas in Queensland, Australia to examine potential environmentally-related health impacts. Methods: Three study areas were selected in an ecologic study design: A CSG area, a coal mining area, and a rural/agricultural area. Admitted patient data, as well as population data and additional factors, were obtained for each calendar year from 1995 through 2011 to calculate all-age hospitalization rates and age-standardized rates in each of these areas. The three areas were compared using negative binomial regression analyses (unadjusted and adjusted models) to examine increases over time of hospitalization rates grouped by primary diagnosis (19 ICD chapters), with rate ratios serving to compare the within-area regression slopes between the areas. Results: The CSG area did not have significant increases in all-cause hospitalization rates over time for all-ages compared to the coal and rural study areas in adjusted models (RR: 1.02, 95 % CI: 1.00-1.04 as compared to the coal mining area; RR: 1.01, 95 % CI: 0.99-1.04 as compared to the rural area). While the CSG area did not show significant increases in specific hospitalization rates compared to both the coal mining and rural areas for any ICD chapters in the adjusted models, the CSG area showed increases in hospitalization rates compared only to the rural area for neoplasms (RR: 1.09, 95 % CI: 1.02-1.16) and blood/immune diseases (RR: 1.14, 95 % CI: 1.02-1.27). Conclusions: This exploratory study of all-age hospitalization rates for three study areas in Queensland suggests that certain hospital admissions rates increased more quickly in the CSG study area than in other study areas, particularly the rural area, after adjusting for key sociodemographic factors. These findings are an important first step in identifying potential health impacts of CSG in the Australian context and serve to generate hypotheses for future studies. © 2016 Werner et al.",Coal seam gas; Environmental health impact; Hospital admissions; Queensland; Unconventional natural gas,"natural gas; adolescent; adult; aged; agriculture; child; coal mining; epidemiology; hospitalization; human; male; middle aged; oil industry; Queensland; regression analysis; spatial analysis; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Agriculture; Child; Coal Industry; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Industry; Queensland; Regression Analysis; Spatial Analysis; Young Adult","Werner, A.K.; Sustainable Minerals Institute, Sir James Foots Bldg (47a), Level 6, CWiMI, Australia; эл. почта: angela.k.werner@gmail.com",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712458,,,26852381.0,English,BMC Public Health,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957864197

In Pennsylvania, the number of producing wells increased from 0 in 2005 to 3,689 in 2013. Few publications have focused on unconventional natural gas development and birth outcomes. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data on 9,384 mothers linked to 10,946 neonates in the Geisinger Health System from January 2009 to January 2013. We estimated cumulative exposure to unconventional natural gas development activity with an inverse-distance squared model that incorporated distance to the mother's home; dates and durations of well pad development, drilling, and hydraulic fracturing; and production volume during the pregnancy. We used multilevel linear and logistic regression models to examine associations between activity index quartile and term birth weight, preterm birth, low 5-minute Apgar score and small size for gestational age birth, while controlling for potential confounding variables. Results: In adjusted models, there was an association between unconventional natural gas development activity and preterm birth that increased across quartiles, with a fourth quartile odds ratio of 1.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.0, 1.9). There were no associations of activity with Apgar score, small for gestational age birth, or term birth weight (after adjustment for year). In a posthoc analysis, there was an association with physician-recorded high-risk pregnancy identified from the problem list (fourth vs. first quartile, 1.3 [95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.7]). Conclusion: Prenatal residential exposure to unconventional natural gas development activity was associated with two pregnancy outcomes, adding to evidence that unconventional natural gas development may impact health.

As global electricity demand continues to grow, particularly if considering a future with increased electrification of heat and transport sectors, the imperative to decarbonise our electricity supply becomes more urgent. This letter implements outputs of a detailed power system optimisation model into a prospective life cycle analysis framework in order to present a life cycle analysis of 44 electricity scenarios for Europe in 2050, including analyses of systems based largely on low-carbon fossil energy options (natural gas, and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS)) as well as systems with high shares of variable renewable energy (VRE) (wind and solar). VRE curtailments and impacts caused by extra energy storage and transmission capabilities necessary in systems based on VRE are taken into account. The results show that systems based largely on VRE perform much better regarding climate change and other impact categories than the investigated systems based on fossil fuels. The climate change impacts from Europe for the year 2050 in a scenario using primarily natural gas are 1400 Tg CO2-eq while in a scenario using mostly coal with CCS the impacts are 480 Tg CO2-eq. Systems based on renewables with an even mix of wind and solar capacity generate impacts of 120-140 Tg CO2-eq. Impacts arising as a result of wind and solar variability do not significantly compromise the climate benefits of utilising these energy resources. VRE systems require more infrastructure leading to much larger mineral resource depletion impacts than fossil fuel systems, and greater land occupation impacts than systems based on natural gas. Emissions and resource requirements from wind power are smaller than from solar power. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",electricity scenarios; life cycle assessment (LCA); power system; REMix; THEMIS,Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal storage; Economic geology; Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Energy resources; Environmental impact; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Mineral resources; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Wind power; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Global electricity demands; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); power system; REMix; THEMIS; Transmission capability; Variable renewable energies; Climate change; climate change; electricity generation; electricity supply; electrification; energy conservation; environmental impact; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; mineral resource; natural gas; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Europe,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956630246

This study is one of the first to identify elevated atmospheric levels of CS2 above national background levels and its mechanisms to dysregulate normal glucose metabolism. Interference in glucose metabolism can indirectly cause other complications (diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and retinopathy), which may be preventable if proper precautions are taken. Rich et al found CS2 and 12 associated sulfide compounds present in the atmosphere in residential areas where unconventional shale oil and gas extraction and processing operations were occurring. Ambient atmospheric concentrations of CS2 ranged from 0.7 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) to 103 ppbv over a continuous 24-hour monitoring period. One-hour ambient atmospheric concentrations ranged from 3.4 ppbv to 504.6 ppbv. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Urban Air Toxic Monitoring Program study as a baseline comparison for atmospheric CS2 concentrations found in this study, it was determined that CS2 atmospheric levels were consistently elevated in areas where unconventional oil and gas extraction and processing occurred. The mechanisms by which CS2 interferes in normal glucose metabolism by dysregulation of the tryptophan metabolism pathway are presented in this study. The literature review found an increased potential for alteration of normal glucose metabolism in viscose rayon occupational workers exposed to CS2. Occupational workers in the energy extraction industry exposed to CS2 and other sulfide compounds may have an increased potential for glucose metabolism interference, which has been an indicator for diabetogenic effect and other related health impacts.

The study assessed different biomethane utilization routes for production of methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), and ammonia, as fuel or platform chemicals and combined heat and power (CHP). Energy efficiency and environmental impacts of the different pathways was studied in a life cycle perspective covering the technical system from biomass production to the end product. Among the routes studied, CHP had the highest energy balance and least environmental impact. DME and methanol performed competently in energy balance and environmental impacts in comparison with the ammonia route. DME had the highest total energy output, as fuel, heat, and steam, among the different routes studied. Substituting the bio-based routes for fossil-based alternatives would give a considerable reduction in environmental impacts such as global warming potential and acidification potential for all routes studied, especially CHP, DME, and methanol.

As much as 336 metric tons of banana pseudo-stems, sheaths, piths, peels and leaves are produced annually. These wastes are usually discarded via composting, aerobic decomposition, incinerated or simply allowed to rot in the fields. However, these treatments may cause serious environmental and ecological problems. Meantime, banana wastes are high in organic content that can be converted to a renewable energy. Renewable energy generation technologies such anaerobic digestion (AD), dark fermentation and ethanol fermentation are commonly reported in scientific literature. This chapter deals with the usability of banana waste as feedstock for bioenergy (in the form of biogas bio-hydrogen and bio-ethanol) production and various pre-treatments commonly applied prior to these processes. AD process is a four-step sequential process whereby bacteria and Archaea break organic matter in the absence of oxygen to produce a mixture of gases (biogas), amongst them energy-rich methane. The generated biogas can be upgraded to bio-methane that can be a substitute for natural gas. The AD process is widely recognized as a promising, robust, low-cost technique for treatment of various organic wastes streams with or without pre-treatment. AD is also easy to perform and the residue from the process called digestate can be used as a bio-fertilizer. Banana residues may become a feedstock of choice in the AD process because of its low lignin content and high biodegradability. There are several bacteria with a potential for hydrogen production through dark fermentation. In recent years, extreme thermophilic bacteria Caldicellulosiruptor sp. have emerged as bacteria of choice for hydrogen production because of high rates and high yields. For banana residues to be used as feedstock for hydrogen production through dark fermentation it must be pre-treated to release organic acids such as acetic and butyric acids, which are preferred substrates for Caldicellulosiruptor sp. Pretreatments to yield simple sugars such as glucose and sucrose can also be employed when a mixed culture is used as the seed for hydrogen production. Various types of yeast have been used for ethanol production from glucose (6 carbons), xylose (5 carbons) or both. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model eukaryotic organism, often used in such research because it is easy to manipulate and culture, and is comparatively similar in structure to human cells. As with dark fermentation, there is a need for a pre-treatment before one can use banana residues for ethanol fermentation as the yeast can only use reduced organic forms such as glucose and xylose. There is also the possible of combined hydrogen or combined ethanol and biogas production thereby maximizing energy yields and producing a valuable fertilizer from the digestate (after AD). In such a scenario, a closed loop can be created. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Banana waste; Bio-fertilizer; Renewable energy; Sustainability; Waste treatment,,"Li, C.; Department of Biotechnology, Naturvetarvägen 16, Sweden; эл. почта: chao_li@biotek.lu.se",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781634854290; 9781634854184,,,English,"Bananas: Cultivation, Consum. and Crop Diseases",Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024850767

Benzene, a HAP and a primary chemical of concern due to its classification as a known human carcinogen, is present in petroleum-rich geologic formations and is formed during the combustion of bypass NG. It is a component in solvents, paraffin breakers, and fuels used in NG extraction and processing (E&P). Objectives: The objectives of this study are to confirm the presence of benzene and benzene-related compounds (benzene[s]) in residential areas, where unconventional shale E&P is occurring, and to determine if benzene[s] exists in elevated atmospheric concentrations when compared to national background levels. Methods: Ambient air sampling was conducted in six counties in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex with passive samples collected in evacuated 6-L Summa canisters. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, with sampling performed at variable distances from the facility fence line. Results: Elevated concentrations of benzene[s] in the atmosphere were identified when compared to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Urban Air Toxics Monitoring Program. The 24-hour benzene concentrations ranged from 0.6 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) to 592 ppbv, with 1-hour concentrations from 2.94 ppbv to 2,900.20 ppbv. Conclusion: Benzene is a known human carcinogen capable of multisystem health effects. Exposure to benzene is correlated with bone marrow and blood-forming organ damage and immune system depression. Sensitive populations (children, pregnant women, elderly, immunocompromised) and occupational workers are at increased risk for adverse health effects from elevated atmospheric levels of benzene[s] in residential areas with unconventional shale E&P. © 2016 SAGE Publications.",benzene; benzene-related compounds; carcinogen; elevated atmospheric levels; health effects; natural gas extraction and processing; occupational exposure; Urban Air Toxics Monitoring Program,,"Rich, A.L.; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Science, Fort Worth, United States; эл. почта: Alisa.Rich@unthsc.edu",,SAGE Publications Inc.,11786302,,,,English,Environ.

Most locations likely to be developed are in rural areas, with potential impact on farmers and small communities. Despite significant health concerns, public health knowledge and growing evidence are often overlooked in decision-making. It is difficult to gain a broad but accurate understanding of the health concerns for rural communities because the evidence has grown very recently and rapidly, is complex and largely based in the USA, where the industry is advanced. In 2016, a concerned South Australian beef and lamb farmer in an area targeted for potential unconventional gas development organised visits to homes in developed unconventional gas areas of Pennsylvania and forums with leading researchers and lawyers in Pennsylvania and New York. Guided by priorities identified during this trip, this communication concisely distils the research evidence on these key concerns, highlighting the Australian situation where evidence exists. It summarises key information of particular concern to rural regions, using Australia as an example, to assist rural health professionals to be better prepared to engage in decision-making and address the challenges associated with this new industry. Issues: Discussions with communities and experts, supported by the expanding research from the USA and Australia, revealed increasing health concerns in six key areas. These are absence of a safe solution to the toxic wastewater management problems, air pollution, land and water competition, mental health and psychosocial wellbeing risks, fugitive methane emissions and lack of proven regulatory regimes. Emerging epidemiological studies suggesting interference with foetal development and birth outcomes, and exacerbation of asthma conditions, are particularly concerning to rural families and livestock. Lessons learned: Rural residents in potentially affected areas should be supported to access and interpret the best current evidence regarding the multiple health concerns associated with unconventional gas mining. This knowledge should be part of wider discourse and decision-making processes driving local economic development and national and global energy choices. © James Cook University 2016.",Australia; Coal seam gas; Coalbed methane; Fracking; Health; Mining; Pollution; Psychosocial impacts; Shale gas; Unconventional gas,natural gas; environmental exposure; female; human; international cooperation; male; mining; occupational exposure; occupational health; prevention and control; risk assessment; rural population; South Australia; standards; statistics and numerical data; United States; Environmental Exposure; Extraction and Processing Industry; Female; Humans; International Cooperation; Male; Natural Gas; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Health; Risk Assessment; Rural Population; South Australia; United States,,,ARHEN - Australian Rural Health Education Network Ltd,14456354,,,27951725.0,English,Rural Remote Health,Note,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010427002

Case-control studies have provided epidemiological evidence of the causative relationship between indoor radon exposure and lung cancer. Twenty-four case-control study papers were found by our search strategy from the PubMed database. Among them, seven studies showed that indoor radon has a statistically significant association with lung cancer. The studies performed in radon-prone areas showed a more positive association between radon and lung cancer. Reviewed papers had inconsistent results on the dose-response relationship between indoor radon and lung cancer risk. Further refined case-control studies will be required to evaluate the relationship between radon and lung cancer.

Suffering from energetic limitations, yields of C4-molecules produced by syngas fermentation are quite low compared with ABE fermentation using sugars as a substrate. On the other hand, fungal production of malic acid has high yields of product per gram metabolized substrate but is currently limited to sugar containing substrates. In this study, it was possible to show that Aspergilus oryzae is able to produce malic acid using acetate as sole carbon source which is a main product of acetogenic syngas fermentation. Bioreactor cultivations were conducted in 2.5 L stirred tank reactors. During the syngas fermentation part of the sequential mixed culture, Clostridium ljungdahlii was grown in modified Tanner medium and sparged with 20 mL/min of artificial syngas mimicking a composition of clean syngas from entrained bed gasification of straw (32.5 vol-% CO, 32.5 vol-% H2, 16 vol-% CO2, and 19 vol-% N2) using a microsparger. Syngas consumption was monitored via automated gas chromatographic measurement of the off-gas. For the fungal fermentation part gas sparging was switched to 0.6 L/min of air and a standard sparger. Ammonia content of medium for syngas fermentation was reduced to 0.33 g/L NH4Cl to meet the requirements for fungal production of dicarboxylic acids. Malic acid production performance of A. oryzae in organic acid production medium and syngas medium with acetate as sole carbon source was verified and gave YP/S values of 0.28 g/g and 0.37 g/g respectively. Growth and acetate formation of C. ljungdahlii during syngas fermentation were not affected by the reduced ammonia content and 66 % of the consumed syngas was converted to acetate. The overall conversion of CO and H2 into malic acid was calculated to be 3.5 g malic acid per mol of consumed syngas or 0.22 g malic acid per gram of syngas. © 2016 Oswald, Dörsam, Veith, Zwick, Neumann, Ochsenreither and Syldatk.",Acetate; Aspergillus oryzae; Clostridium ljungdahlii; Fermentation; Malic acid; Process coupling; Syngas,acetic acid; ammonium chloride; malic acid; natural gas; syngas; unclassified drug; anaerobic bacterium; analytic method; Article; Aspergillus oryzae; carbon source; Clostridium; Clostridium ljungdahlii; fermentation; fermentation optimization; fungus fermentation; gas chromatography; ion chromatography; mixed cell culture; nitrogen concentration; nonhuman; syngas fermentation,"Oswald, F.; Technical Biology, Germany; эл. почта: florian.oswald@kit.edu",,Frontiers Research Foundation,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

The changes caused by climate and oil/gas development Southeast of the city of Nadym were investigated using multi-temporal and multi-spatial remotely sensed images. Comparison between high spatial resolution imagery acquired in 1968 and 2006 indicates that 8.9% of the study area experienced an increase in vegetation cover (e.g. establishment of new saplings, extent of vegetated cover) in response to climate warming while 10.8% of the area showed a decrease in vegetation cover due to oil and gas development and logging activities. Waterlogging along linear structures and vehicle tracks was found near the oil and gas development site, while in natural landscapes the drying of thermokarst lakes is evident due to warming caused permafrost degradation. A Landsat time series dataset was used to document the spatial and temporal dynamics of these ecosystems in response to climate change and disturbances. The impacts of land use on surface vegetation, radiative, and hydrological properties were evaluated using Landsat image-derived biophysical indices. The spatial and temporal analyses suggest that the direct impacts associated with infrastructure development were mostly within 100 m distance from the disturbance source. While these impacts are rather localized they persist for decades despite partial recovery of vegetation after the initial disturbance and can have significant implications for changes in permafrost dynamics and surface energy budgets at landscape and regional scales. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",arctic ecosystems; Corona; land use change; Landsat; permafrost; Quickbird; remote sensing indices,Arctic vehicles; Budget control; Crashworthiness; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Mineral resources; Natural gas vehicles; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Corona; Land-use change; LANDSAT; Quickbird; Remote sensing index; Climate change; arctic environment; climate change; land cover; land use change; Landsat; permafrost; QuickBird; remote sensing; Nadym; Russian Federation; Siberia; Yamalo-Nenets; Animalia,"Yu, Q.; Department of Geography, United States; эл. почта: qinyu@gwu.edu",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952906492

Understanding how alternative uses of biomass compare in terms of financial and environmental parameters is therefore necessary to help ensure that efficient uses of resources are encouraged by policy and undertaken by industry. In this paper, we compare the environmental and financial performance of using ethanol as a feedstock for bioethylene production or as a transport fuel in the US life cycle-based models are developed to isolate the relative impacts of these two ethanol uses and generate results that are applicable irrespective of ethanol production pathway. Ethanol use as a feedstock for bioethylene production or as a transport fuel leads to comparable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil energy consumption reductions relative to their counterparts produced from fossil sources. By displacing gasoline use in vehicles, use of ethanol as a transport fuel is six times more effective in reducing petroleum energy use on a life cycle basis. In contrast, bioethylene predominately avoids consumption of natural gas. Considering 2013 US ethanol and ethylene market prices, our analysis shows that bioethylene is financially viable only if significant price premiums are realized over conventional ethylene, from 35% to 65% depending on the scale of bioethylene production considered (80 000 t yr-1 to 240 000 t yr-1). Ethanol use as a transportation fuel is therefore the preferred pathway considering financial, GHG emissions, and petroleum energy use metrics, although bioethylene production could have strategic value if demand-side limitations of ethanol transport fuel markets are reached. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",bulk chemicals from biomass; ethanol; ethylene; life cycle asssessment,Biomass; Commerce; Costs; Crashworthiness; Energy utilization; Ethanol; Ethylene; Feedstocks; Finance; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum transportation; Bulk chemicals; Environmental parameter; Ethanol production; Financial implications; Financial performance; Fossil energy consumption; Strategic values; Transportation fuels; Life cycle; biofuel; biomass; ethanol; ethylene; life cycle analysis; transportation system; United States,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952894873

However it is unclear if this reduced birth weight was due to prematurity or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Methods: In order to understand the relationship between various cooking fuels and risk of LBW and small for gestational age (SGA), we analyzed data from a birth cohort study conducted in Lanzhou, China which included 9,895 singleton live births. Results: Compared to mothers using gas as cooking fuel, significant reductions in birth weight were observed for mothers using coal (weight difference = 73.31 g, 95 % CI: 26.86, 119.77) and biomass (weight difference = 87.84 g, 95 % CI: 10.76, 164.46). Using biomass as cooking fuel was associated with more than two-fold increased risk of LBW (OR = 2.51, 95 % CI: 1.26, 5.01), and the risk was mainly seen among preterm births (OR = 3.43, 95 % CI: 1.21, 9.74). No significant associations with LBW were observed among mothers using coal or electromagnetic stoves for cooking. Conclusions: These findings suggest that exposure to biomass during pregnancy is associated with risk of LBW, and the effect of biomass on LBW may be primarily due to prematurity rather than IUGR. © 2015 Jiang et al.",Birth weight; China; Cooking fuel; Epidemiology; Low birth weight; Small for gestational age,"coal; natural gas; adult; biomass; birth weight; China; cohort analysis; cooking; electromagnetic radiation; female; Fetal Growth Retardation; human; low birth weight; male; newborn; pregnancy; Premature Birth; prematurity; prenatal exposure; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Biomass; Birth Weight; China; Coal; Cohort Studies; Cooking; Electromagnetic Radiation; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Male; Natural Gas; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Young Adult","Liu, Q.; Gansu Provincial Maternity and Child Care Hospital, 143 North Road, China; эл. почта: lxhzxq609@163.com",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712458,,,26215397.0,English,BMC Public Health,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018150600

The main reason for such restrictions is high sloshing loads around these filling depths. The new designs of prismatic LNG cargo tanks are proposed by increasing the lower chamfer length. Numerical sloshing analysis was used to optimize tank shape out of the several candidates. To validate the effectiveness of the modified tank, 1/50 scaled model tests were conducted. In these tests, 24 different irregular seaways were tested for both the conventional and the optimized tank and their statistical pressures were compared.

In the SHIPP method, a restrictive assumption is used that the severity of the adverse events progresses only through sequential failures of the five safety barriers considered.In the proposed methodology, shortcomings of the existing accident model are improved in the following ways. Firstly, the above mentioned restrictive sequential progression assumption is mitigated in the SHIPP methodology by allowing non-sequential failure of safety barriers to cause adverse events in any order. Secondly, in the prediction of posterior probabilities of adverse events for real time industrial data, an important mechanical safety barrier 'Damage Control Emergency Management Barrier' has been included. Further, posterior probabilities of the occurrence of the adverse events are calculated using a Bayesian network (BN) approach. The utility of this approach is tested and demonstrated with the data from a liquefied natural gas (LNG) process facility. The method allows for continual updating of occurrence probabilities for adverse events and failure probabilities of safety barriers for successive real time data from industry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Accident precursors; Bayesian updating mechanism; Predictive model; Process accident model,Accidents; Bayesian networks; Liquefied natural gas; Probability; Professional aspects; Risk management; Safety engineering; Ships; Accident models; Accident precursors; Bayesian updating; Fault and event trees; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Network-based approach; Occurrence probability; Predictive modeling; Accident prevention; liquefied natural gas; accident modeling methodology; Article; Bayesian network; calculation; controlled study; engineering; industry; methodology; occupational safety; prediction; priority journal; probability; risk assessment; statistical analysis,"Khan, F.; Safety and Risk Engineering Group (SREG), Canada",,Elsevier,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

Methods: Li people above 40 years of age from Hainan were chosen by stratified random cluster sampling between 2012 and 2014. All participants were interviewed with a home-visiting questionnaire, and spirometry was performed on all eligible participants. Patients with airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] &lt;0.70) were further examined by postbronchodilator spirometry, and those with a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;0.70 was diagnosed with COPD. The information of physical condition and history, smoking intensity, smoking duration, second-hand smoking, education, job category, monthly household income, working years, residential environment, primary fuel for cooking and heating (biomass fuel including wood, crop residues, dung, and charcoal, or modern fuel such as natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, electricity, and solar energy), ventilated kitchen, heating methods, air pollution, recurrent respiratory infections, family history of respiratory diseases, cough incentives, and allergies of COPD and non-COPD subjects was analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to identify correlated risk factors for COPD. Results: Out of the 5,463 Li participants, a total of 277 COPD cases were identified by spirometry, and 307 healthy subjects were randomly selected as controls. Univariate logistic regression analyses showed that older people (65 years and above), low body mass index (BMI), biomass smoke, 11–20 and &gt;20 cigarettes/day, smoking for 40 years or more, second-hand smoking, recurrent respiratory infections, and induced cough were risk factors for COPD, whereas high BMI, high education level, and presence of ventilated kitchen were protective factors. Subsequent multivariate logistic regression model further demonstrated that aging, low BMI, biomass smoke, &gt;20 cigarettes/day, and recurrent respiratory tract infections were high-risk factors for COPD in the Li population. Conclusion: The incidence of COPD has a strong correlation with age, BMI, biomass smoke, &gt;20 cigarettes/day, and recurrent respiratory infections, suggesting they were high-risk factors for COPD in Li population. © 2015 Ding et al.",Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Epidemiology; Li population; Survey,"adult; aged; Article; biomass; body mass; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; correlation analysis; education; ethnic group; ethnicity; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; household; human; Li (people); logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; passive smoking; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; spirometry; adverse effects; age; Asian continental ancestry group; China; epidemiology; ethnology; health status; health survey; housing; incidence; lung; multivariate analysis; obesity; odds ratio; pathophysiology; prevalence; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; risk factor; smoking; socioeconomics; statistical model; vital capacity; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Body Mass Index; China; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Health Status; Health Surveys; Housing; Humans; Incidence; Logistic Models; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Obesity; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Risk Factors; Smoking; Socioeconomic Factors; Spirometry; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vital Capacity","Ding, Y.; Department of Emergency, Mailbox Number 19 Xiuhua Road, China; эл. почта: yipengding69@yeah.net",,Dove Medical Press Ltd.,11769106,,,26664107.0,English,Int.

However, due to their large size, the lifetime of microbubbles in the circulation system is on the order of minutes, and they cannot penetrate through the endothelial gap to enter the tumor. In an acoustic field, liquefied gas nanoparticles may be able to change the state and become the gas form in a few cycles of exposure without significant heating effects. Such a phenomenon is called as acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV). This review is intended to introduce the emerging application of ADV. The physics and the theoretical model behind it are introduced for further understanding of the mechanisms. Current manufacturing approaches are provided, and their differences are compared. Based on the characteristic of phase shift, a variety of therapeutic applications have been carried out both in vitro and in vivo. The latest progress and interesting results of vessel occlusion, thermal ablation using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), localized drug delivery to the tumor and cerebral tissue through the blood-brain barrier, localized tissue erosion by histotripsy are summarized. ADV may be able to overcome some limitations of microbubble-mediated ultrasound therapy and provide a novel drug and molecular targeting carrier.

Most indoor exposure occurs by diffusion of soil gas. Radon is also found in well water, natural gas, and ambient air. Pennsylvania has high indoor radon concentrations; buildings are often tested during real estate transactions, with results reported to the Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP). Objectives: We evaluated predictors of indoor radon concentrations. Methods: Using first-floor and basement indoor radon results reported to the PADEP between 1987 and 2013, we evaluated associations of radon concentrations (natural log transformed) with geology, water source, building characteristics, season, weather, community socioeconomic status, community type, and unconventional natural gas development measures based on drilled and producing wells. Results: Primary analysis included 866,735 first measurements by building, with the large majority from homes. The geologic rock layer on which the building sat was strongly associated with radon concentration (e.g., Axemann Formation, median = 365 Bq/m3, IQR = 167-679 vs. Stockton Formation, median = 93 Bq/m3, IQR = 52-178). In adjusted analysis, buildings using well water had 21% higher concentrations (β = 0.191, 95% CI: 0.184, 0.198). Buildings in cities (vs. townships) had lower concentrations (β = -0.323, 95% CI: -0.333, -0.314). When we included multiple tests per building, concentrations declined with repeated measurements over time. Between 2005 and 2013, 7,469 unconventional wells were drilled in Pennsylvania. Basement radon concentrations fluctuated between 1987 and 2003, but began an upward trend from 2004 to 2012 in all county categories (p &lt; 0.001), with higher levels in counties having ≥ 100 drilled wells versus counties with none, and with highest levels in the Reading Prong. Conclusions: Geologic unit, well water, community, weather, and unconventional natural gas development were associated with indoor radon concentrations. Future studies should include direct environmental measurement of radon, as well as building features unavailable for this analysis. © 2015, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Three gas explosions occurred between January 2010 and November 2010: two occurred at different houses that were connected to the Kuwait Oil Company natural gas network in north Al-Ahmadi, and one occurred at a house in south Al-Ahmadi that was not connected to the network. These explosion incidents triggered an immediate investigation. The fault tree analysis was used to identify the type and the source of the leaking gas and to determine how the leaking gas reached the surface. Four different source hypotheses were investigated: leaks from the natural gas network, leaks from the sewer network, leaks from wells and boreholes in and around the town of Al-Ahmadi, and leaks from underground geological formations. The study concluded that the leaking gas in the Al-Ahmadi incidents was natural gas and of geological origin. The natural gas gradually migrated from deep hydrocarbon reservoirs upwards through cap-rock fractures. The gas collected in the Dammam formation and soil near the surface and then leaked into the air. The analysis and the results of this investigation can serve as a useful reference if any similar gas leak incidents happen elsewhere. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Al-Ahmadi; Dammam formation; Formation fractures; Gas explosion; Gas leakage; Kuwait,,"Alkhaledi, K.; Industrial and Management Systems Engineering Department, College of Engineering and Petroleum, Kuwait University, P.O.

Drawing on insights from risk perception and risk governance theories and recent public opinion surveys, we find that UGD is an emerging technology that is likely to be perceived as risky, even though objective risk assessments suggest that risks are low and controllable through best risk management practices. Perceived risk varies significantly depending on the state and locality but perceptions of risk appear to be increasing as the technology is used more widely in the United States and as organized opponents of the technology intensify their efforts. Risk perceptions are attenuated somewhat because of the perceived benefits of UGD and compensation schemes for individuals and communities. The types of triggering events necessary for large-scale social amplification and stigmatization have not yet occurred but awareness of UGD is growing and organized opposition has been sufficient to cause prohibitions of UGD in some U.S. states and localities.

The control group consisted of physically healthy men of similar age who had children within marriage. The malondialdehyde levels in the ejaculate and morphokinetic parameters of sperm cells were assessed. Natural gas and oil-dissolved gas were the most toxic against fertilizing properties of the ejaculate, they led to sharp decline in sperm concentration and motility of sperm cells by reducing the active mobile forms in oil and gas industry workers. In workers of radio-location and television and radio broadcasting facilities, essential modifications of sperm cell morphology were caused by mechanical damage of the microwave radiation. In creative workers suppression of spermatogenesis had complex nature due to the enhanced dynamics of free-radical oxidation, as well as the participation of the central regulatory mechanisms. The unemployed and low-income people with hyponutrition and malnutrition had suppression of spermatogenesis caused by a lack of biological resources necessary to maintain spermatogenesis and provide reliable antioxidant protection.

The book has now been given its own unique ISBN and is otherwise identical in every way to the original publication. Feeding Everyone No Matter What presents a scientific approach to the practicalities of planning for long-term interruption to food production. The primary historic solution developed over the last several decades is increased food storage. However, storing up enough food to feed everyone would take a significant amount of time and would increase the price of food, killing additional people due to inadequate global access to affordable food. Humanity is far from doomed, however, in these situations - there are solutions. This book provides an order of magnitude technical analysis comparing caloric requirements of all humans for five years with conversion of existing vegetation and fossil fuels to edible food. It presents mechanisms for global-scale conversion including: natural gas-digesting bacteria, extracting food from leaves, and conversion of fiber by enzymes, mushroom or bacteria growth, or a two-step process involving partial decomposition of fiber by fungi and/or bacteria and feeding them to animals such as beetles, ruminants (cows, deer, etc), rats and chickens. It includes an analysis to determine the ramp rates for each option and the results show that careful planning and global cooperation could ensure the bulk of humanity and biodiversity could be maintained in even in the most extreme circumstances. • Summarizes the severity and probabilities of global catastrophe scenarios, which could lead to a complete loss of agricultural production • More than 10 detailed mechanisms for global-scale solutions to the food crisis and their evaluation to test their viability • Detailed roadmap for future R&D for human survival after global catastrophe. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The uncertainty in source apportionment (uncertainty in source-specific exposure estimates and model uncertainty due to the unknown number of sources and identifiability conditions) has been largely ignored in previous studies. Also, spatial dependence of multipollutant data collected from multiple monitoring sites has not yet been incorporated into multivariate receptor modeling. The objectives of this project are (1) to develop a multipollutant approach that incorporates both sources of uncertainty in source-apportionment into the assessment of source-specific health effects and (2) to develop enhanced multivariate receptor models that can account for spatial correlations in the multipollutant data collected from multiple sites. We employed a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework consisting of multivariate receptor models, health-effects models, and a hierarchical model on latent source contributions. For the health model, we focused on the time-series design in this project. Each combination of number of sources and identifiability conditions (additional constraints on model parameters) defines a different model. We built a set of plausible models with extensive exploratory data analyses and with information from previous studies, and then computed posterior model probability to estimate model uncertainty. Parameter estimation and model uncertainty estimation were implemented simultaneously by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC*) methods. We validated the methods using simulated data. We illustrated the methods using PM2.5 (particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter) speciation data and mortality data from Phoenix, Arizona, and Houston, Texas. The Phoenix data included counts of cardiovascular deaths and daily PM2.5 speciation data from 1995-1997. The Houston data included respiratory mortality data and 24-hour PM2.5 speciation data sampled every six days from a region near the Houston Ship Channel in years 2002-2005. We also developed a Bayesian spatial multivariate receptor modeling approach that, while simultaneously dealing with the unknown number of sources and identifiability conditions, incorporated spatial correlations in the multipollutant data collected from multiple sites into the estimation of source profiles and contributions based on the discrete process convolution model for multivariate spatial processes. This new modeling approach was applied to 24-hour ambient air concentrations of 17 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured at nine monitoring sites in Harris County, Texas, during years 2000 to 2005. Simulation results indicated that our methods were accurate in identifying the true model and estimated parameters were close to the true values. The results from our methods agreed in general with previous studies on the source apportionment of the Phoenix data in terms of estimated source profiles and contributions. However, we had a greater number of statistically insignificant findings, which was likely a natural consequence of incorporating uncertainty in the estimated source contributions into the health-effects parameter estimation. For the Houston data, a model with five sources (that seemed to be Sulfate-Rich Secondary Aerosol, Motor Vehicles, Industrial Combustion, Soil/Crustal Matter, and Sea Salt) showed the highest posterior model probability among the candidate models considered when fitted simultaneously to the PM2.5 and mortality data. There was a statistically significant positive association between respiratory mortality and same-day PM2.5 concentrations attributed to one of the sources (probably industrial combustion). The Bayesian spatial multivariate receptor modeling approach applied to the VOC data led to a highest posterior model probability for a model with five sources (that seemed to be refinery, petrochemical production, gasoline evaporation, natural gas, and vehicular exhaust) among several candidate models, with the number of sources varying between three and seven and with different identifiability conditions. Our multipollutant approach assessing source-specific health effects is more advantageous than a single-pollutant approach in that it can estimate total health effects from multiple pollutants and can also identify emission sources that are responsible for adverse health effects. Our Bayesian approach can incorporate not only uncertainty in the estimated source contributions, but also model uncertainty that has not been addressed in previous studies on assessing source-specific health effects. The new Bayesian spatial multivariate receptor modeling approach enables predictions of source contributions at unmonitored sites, minimizing exposure misclassification and providing improved exposure estimates along with their uncertainty estimates, as well as accounting for uncertainty in the number of sources and identifiability conditions.",,"air pollutant; dangerous goods; particulate matter; adverse effects; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; artificial intelligence; Bayes theorem; chemically induced; chemistry; computer simulation; dangerous goods; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; government; human; particulate matter; pharmacology; procedures; prospective study; respiratory tract disease; statistical analysis; statistical model; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Models, Statistical; Particulate Matter; Prospective Studies; Respiratory Tract Diseases; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency",,,,10415505,,,26333239.0,English,Res Rep Health Eff Inst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942596714

Colloquially known as fracking, UNGDO is a controversial process that employs large volumes of water to fracture the shale and capture gas; it has become a multi-billion dollar industry in Pennsylvania. We analyzed letters to the editor of the most widely circulated local newspaper in the most heavily drilled county in Pennsylvania (Bradford County) in order to characterize residents’ concerns and their involvement in popular epidemiology—the process by which citizens investigate risks associated with a perceived environmental threat. We reviewed 215 letters to the editor that referenced natural gas operations and were published by The Daily Review between January 1, 2008 and June 8, 2013. We used NVivo 10 to code and analyze letters and identify major themes. Nvivo is qualitative data analysis software (http://www.qsrinternational.com/products_nvivo.aspx) that allows researchers to code and analyze “unstructured” data, including text files of any type (e.g., interview transcripts, news articles, letters, archival materials) as well as photographs and videos. Nvivo can be used to classify, sort, query, comment on, and share data across a research group. Letters demonstrated citizen engagement in beginning and intermediate stages of lay epidemiology, as well as discord and stress regarding four main issues: socio-economic impacts, perceived threats to water, population growth and implications, and changes to the rural landscape. Residents called for stronger scientific evidence and a balance of economic development and health and environmental protections. Citizens’ distress regarding UNGDO appeared to be exacerbated by a dearth of information to guide economic growth and health, environmental, and social concerns. This analysis proposes locally informed questions to guide future surveillance and research. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Environmental health; Environmental pollution; Fossil fuels; Fracking; Gas wells; Natural gas,natural gas; consumer; employment; environment; environmental monitoring; fracking; health status; human; Pennsylvania; perception; procedures; publication; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; water pollution; Consumer Participation; Employment; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Health Status; Humans; Hydraulic Fracking; Natural Gas; Newspapers as Topic; Pennsylvania; Perception; Socioeconomic Factors; Water Pollution,"Cannuscio, C.C.; Perelman School of Medicine, Anatomy and Chemistry Room 145, 3620 Hamilton Walk, United States",,Kluwer Academic Publishers,00945145,,JCMHB,25392053.0,English,J.

The intensive work required to extract this source of energy results in higher than usual numbers of vehicles involved, potential release of emissions from those vehicles in congested zones surrounding the drill site, and release of other contaminants from materials drawn back out of the borehole after fracturing of the shale. Typical contaminants would be diesel exhaust particulate and gases, volatile organic compounds and other hydrocarbons both from diesels and the drilling process, crystalline silica, used as part of the hydraulic fracturing process in kiloton quantities, and methane escaping from the borehole and piping. A rise in respiratory disease with proximity to the process has been reported in nearby communities and both silica and diesel exposures at the worksite are recognized respiratory hazards. Because of the relatively short time this process has been used to the extent it is currently being used, it is not possible to draw detailed conclusions about the respiratory hazards that may be posed. However, based on the traffic volume associated with each drill site and the number of drill sites in any locale, it is possible at least to compare the effects to that of large traffic volume highways which are known to produce some respiratory effects in surrounding areas. © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.",diesel exhaust; hydraulic fracturing; ultrafines; VOCs,"1,2,4 trimethylbenzene; acetaldehyde; acetone; acrolein derivative; alcohol; benzaldehyde; benzene; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benz[a]anthracene; chrysene; crotonaldehyde; decane; dibenz[a,h]anthracene; dichloromethane; formaldehyde; hydrocarbon; indeno[1,2,3 cd]pyrene; isoprene; meta xylene; methane; naphthalene; natural gas; octane; ozone; phenanthrene; propylene; silicon dioxide; volatile organic compound; xylene; air pollutant; natural gas; particulate matter; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; asthma; building; construction work; dust; dust exposure; exhaust gas; explosion; grating; health hazard; highway; human; industrial worker; ionizing radiation; lower respiratory tract; lung disease; occupational exposure; occupational lung disease; oil shale; particle size; particulate matter; personal monitoring; powder; priority journal; respiratory function; sand; silicosis; United States; upper respiratory tract; adverse effects; air pollutant; analysis; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; mining; pathophysiology; procedures; Respiratory Tract Diseases; time; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Extraction and Processing Industry; Humans; Natural Gas; Particulate Matter; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Time Factors","McCawley, M.; Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, West Virginia University, PO Box 9190, United States",,"Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.",10693424,,SRCCE,26024346.0,English,Semin.

Alternative fuels, including biodiesel, and a natural gas/diesel blend, offer the potential to reduce engine emissions and associated health effects. For this pilot study, exposure monitoring was performed in an underground mine during operation of a load-haul-dump vehicle. Use of low-sulfur diesel, 75% biodiesel/25% diesel blend (B75), and natural gas/diesel blend (GD) fuels were compared. Personal samples were collected for total and respirable diesel particulate matter (tDPM and rDPM, respectively) and total and respirable elemental and organic carbon (tEC, rEC, tOC, rOC, respectively), as well as carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, naphthalene, nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Compared to diesel, B75 use was associated with a 33% reduction in rDPM, reductions in rEC, tEC, and naphthalene, increased tDPM, tOC, and NO, and no change in rOC, CO, and NO2. Compared to diesel, GD was associated with a 66% reduction in rDPM and a reduction in all other exposures except CO the alternative fuels tested both resulted in reduced rDPM, which is the basis for the current Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) occupational exposure standard. Although additional study is needed with a wider variety of equipment, use of alternative fuels have the promise of reducing exposures from vehicular exhaust in underground mining settings. © 2015 Copyright © 2015 JOEH, LLC.",,"air pollutant; biofuel; carbon; carbon monoxide; exhaust gas; gasoline; natural gas; nitrogen oxide; organic compound; particulate matter; air pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; indoor air pollution; mining; occupational exposure; particulate matter; pilot study; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Air Pollution, Indoor; Biofuels; Carbon; Carbon Monoxide; Environmental Monitoring; Gasoline; Humans; Mining; Natural Gas; Nitrogen Oxides; Occupational Exposure; Organic Chemicals; Particulate Matter; Pilot Projects; Vehicle Emissions","Lutz, E.A.; Mining Safety and Health Program, 1656 E.

Box 8469, Harrisburg, PA  17105-8469, United States","This presentation provides an overview of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's experiences and ongoing studies related to technologically enhanced, naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM) in the oil and gas industry. It has been known for many years that Pennsylvania's geology is unique, with several areas having relatively high levels of natural uranium and thorium. In the 1950s, a few areas of the state were evaluated for commercial uranium production. In the late 1970s, scoping studies of radon in homes prompted the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Bureau of Radiation Protection (BRP) to begin planning for a larger state-wide radon study. The BRP and Oil and Gas Bureau also performed a TENORM study of produced water in the early 1990s for a number of conventional oil and gas wells. More recently, BRP and the Bureau of Solid Waste developed radiation monitoring regulations for all Pennsylvania solid waste disposal facilities. These were implemented in 2001, prompting another evaluation of oil and gas operations and sludge generated from the treatment of conventionally produced water and brine but mainly focused on the disposal of TENORM solid waste in the state's Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Subtitle D landfills. However, since 2008, the increase in volumes of gas well wastewater and levels of Ra observed in the unconventional shale gas well flow-back fracking water has compelled DEP to fully re-examine these oil and gas operations. Specifically, with BRP in the lead, a new TENORM study of oil and gas operations and related wastewater treatment operations has been initiated (), supported by an American National Standards Institute standard on TENORM () and a U.S. Government Accountability Office report on shale resource development and risks (). This study began in early 2013 and will examine the potential public and worker radiation exposure and environmental impact as well as re-evaluate TENORM waste disposal. This presentation summarizes conventional and unconventional oil and gas well operations, geology and respective uranium/thorium content, radium content in oil and gas wastewater, treatment solids, radon in natural gas, the scope of other TENORM issues in the state, regulatory framework, national regulations and guidance. It also provides an overview of past and the status of ongoing TENORM studies in the Commonwealth (; Rowan and Kraemer 2012; ).",,industrial waste; natural gas; petroleum; radioactive waste; radon; uranium; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; geology; government; human; industrial waste; industry; procedures; radioactive waste; United States; waste disposal; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Geology; Humans; Industrial Waste; Industry; Natural Gas; Pennsylvania; Petroleum; Radioactive Waste; Radon; Refuse Disposal; State Government; Uranium,,,,15385159,,,25551500.0,English,Health Phys,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920725139

The intent was to introduce Native American students to the energy resource evaluation process, providing context and experience that could perhaps lead to greater interest and expanded career opportunities in energy exploration and production. If the resource proves viable and the tribe decides to move forward with developing it, potential benefits to the reservation could include more jobs, economic development, and a local, affordable energy supply. The National Energy Technology Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy was engaged to provide expertise on shale gas development and the mitigation of possible environmental impacts. Objectives of the study were to characterize stratigraphy, lithology, mineral composition, organic content, thermal maturity, depositional environments, reservoir properties, regional trends, structural features, and potentially hydrocarbon-productive horizons and locations within the Niobrara Formation in South Dakota. The Niobrara is an active play farther west in Colorado and Wyoming, but it is not typically produced commercially in South Dakota. Nevertheless, natural gas shows are often encountered in the unit across South Dakota, and some wells have reportedly supplied gas from the Niobrara to individual farms for up to twenty years. The approach for this project was to use available geological data and models to determine gas-in-place and ultimate expected recovery. Niobrara drill cores from Nebraska, Wyoming and South Dakota were sampled at the U.S. Geological Survey core library in Denver for source rock analysis and petrography. Although no public cores were available close to the Rosebud Reservation, trends in the regional samples indicated that the Niobrara in south-central South Dakota may contain organic matter contents as high as 6% by weight, derived largely from Type II kerogen, with thermal maturity in the biogenic gas window. Porosity in the carbonate units may be quite high, and hold significant quantities of shallow gas. The South Dakota Geological Survey has provided a new core from the Pierre/Niobrara section south of Presho, SD for access to fresh samples that are closer to the reservation. The Niobrara Formation at Rosebud Reservation is too shallow to produce the large quantities of natural gas favored by commercial energy companies. However, the relatively inexpensive drilling costs and potential for modest production may provide the tribe with a secure and economical energy supply, suggesting a smaller-scale approach for unconventional gas development that could be applied elsewhere.

The primary driver for this revolution has been the expansion of horizontal drilling with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing to access sufficient reservoir to make these developments highly economic. While significant progress in characterizing these reservoirs and the well completion has been made and continues at a rapid rate, significant challenges remain. Fundamentals of pressure-transient analysis (PTA) and rate-transient analysis (RTA) for characterizing the reservoirs and completions in these unconventional oil and gas reservoirs are fairly well established yet continue to expand at a significant rate. One shortfall in the state of the current literature related to these evaluation techniques is an over-reliance on the old adage of using pressure analysis for oil reservoirs and using pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time for analyzing pressure and rate data from gas reservoirs. Because of the extremely low permeability seen in these unconventional oil plays, the wellbore pressure and near-well reservoir pressures can see significant changes (4000-8000 psi) in relative short periods of time. Changes in liquid PVT and rock properties can be substantial over such large pressure changes. As such, use of traditional pressure analysis for these unconventional oil reservoirs is in direct violation of the assumptions used in the derivation of the liquid solutions; e.g., single-phase oil of constant viscosity and slight and constant compressibility. Not accounting for these changes in fluid properties can result in significant errors in calculated reservoir and completion parameters. Within this paper, for the first time, we show that use of an oil-based pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time properly account for these fluid and rock property changes, providing accurate estimates of reservoir and completion parameters for the Bakken and Eagle Ford reservoirs. To properly evaluate the pseudo-time, new expressions for the average reservoir pressure during transient radial and transient linear flow have been derived. In fact, for both radial and linear flow, it is shown that the average reservoir pseudo-pressure (pressure) within the active drainage radius is a unique function of the initial reservoir pressure and the wellbore pressure. For the radial flow problem, this can be taken even further to show that the average pseudo-pressure and, therefore, average reservoir pressure is a constant within the drainage radius for which the log-approximation is valid. These expressions represent significant advancements in the realm of pressure-transient analysis for a number of reasons. First, they allow the direct calculation of pseudo-time rather than through an iterative process, making use of pseudo-time no more ominous than using pseudo-pressure. Second, shut-in of the well for a pressure-buildup test is no longer required to obtain the average reservoir pressure. Third, these expressions provide a theoretical basis for the long held recommendation developed from empirical observation that normal time rather than pseudo-time be used for drawdown analysis for radial gas flow. Synthetic reservoir models are used to generate data to verify the rigor and accuracy of these new relations and analysis methods.

Since the first application of this technology by Maersk in the Dan Field in the mid-1980's oil and gas reservoirs have seen improved productivity and profitability. However, identifying the key drivers for success of multiple fractured horizontal well technology has proven difficult especially in unconventional reservoirs where data is limited. With few vertical wells, logs and core data typically used for building a basis of completion and stimulation design are often lacking. As a result, other methods of identifying success drivers must be developed and utilized. To this end, this paper utilizes a data-mining and statistical analysis of well, completion, fracture stimulation, and production data to establish the important parameters for success in horizontal wells in the Montney Formation of Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. In this study more than 3,300 horizontal wells were characterized with respect to lateral length, completion type, number of stages, fracture fluids pumped, proppant loading, costs, and production. The study utilized the statistical software JMP to identify key relationships between well data. The software system allowed standard screening and more advanced graphical methods to be applied to validate the dataset. From the quality assured dataset various additional parameters were calculated and used in the analysis. Both regression analysis and statistical 'heat maps' were used to correlate and visualize data trends. Heat maps are shown as a useful tool for visualizing strongly trending data. Another finding from this study is that cased and cemented horizontal wells in the Montney Formation had significantly better initial productivity (+31%) and first year cumulatives (+42%) than open hole external packer completion systems even though the cased and cemented wellbores had fewer stages (-40%), larger stimulations (+390%), and increased costs (+14%). While additional completed stages may increase cumulative recovery in the Montney Formation, statistical analysis demonstrates the recovery per stage decreases after a certain stage density. This conclusion is consistent with recent findings (VISAGE and Jim Gouveia 2014). Results of the study clearly demonstrate that wells with the smallest frac fluid load recovery have the best cumulative gas recovery with time, and spending more for the completion translates into higher production. This work is important as it identifies relevant completion trends in the Montney Formation and completion and stimulation practices linked to higher recovery and well success. This is also the first field-wide statistical review of wells completed in the Montney Formation using more advanced data mining and statistical analysis. The work lays a foundation for application of these techniques to more unconventional and tight oil and gas reservoirs.

Then, we combined molecular simulation (MS) with digital rock reconstruction technique to investigate the natural gas storage and transport behavior in ultra-low permeable shale matrices containing nano-scale pore structures. 3-D nano-pore structure is recreated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation based on the 2-D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of shame sample. Generally, single molecular layer adsorption in simple geometries is observed and the adsorption isotherm can be fitted by Langmuir type of adsorption isotherm. Besides, non- continuum features of gas transport behaviors such as slippery boundary and Knudsen diffusion dominated flow demonstrate that conventional Darcy's equation may not adequately describe the flow behavior in shale reservoir. Knudsen diffusivity is obtained by molecular simulation which could be beneficial in reservoir simulation. The combination of MCMC and molecular simulation (MS) offers a unique approach towards investigating gas transport in complex porous networks in the shale formation.

Recently several authors have recognized the potential to extract key properties from this early-time data. This work will expand on the analytical flowback analysis model presented by Clarkson and Williams-Kovacs (2013a) and modified by Williams-Kovacs and Clarkson (2013a). These works presented a data-driven pseudo-analytical modelling approach for quantitatively analyzing 2-phase flowback to estimate key frac properties including fracture conductivity and half-length. In these early attempts to model flowback from shale gas wells, multi-phase depletion from the fracture network was assumed to be the primary flow-regime. More recently, three flow-regimes have been observed in flowback data depending on data frequency: 1) transient radial flow of frac fluid within the fracture network prior to breakthrough of formation fluids (rarely seen in shale gas); 2) Single-phase depletion of water within the fracture network (also rarely seen); and 3) coupled formation and fracture flow following breakthrough of formation fluid. In this work, flow-regimes 1-3 are modelled rigorously. Flow-regime 3 is the focus of this study and will be modelled using a coupling of transient linear flow of gas from the matrix to the fractures with multi-phase depletion within the fracture network (conceptually more realistic than previous attempts). Further, dynamic fracture porosity and permeability are incorporated to better represent the physics of the problem and a modified material balance equation (MBE) is developed to account for additional drive mechanisms (fracture closure in addition to desorption and gas expansion). Finally a modified pseudo-pressure and pseudotime and is applied to before-breakthrough (BBT) single-phase rate-transient analysis (RTA) and after-breakthrough (ABT) multi-phase RTA (conducted after analytical simulation using pressure and saturation dependent outputs from simulation) to improve both parameter estimates (BBT) and flow-regime confirmation (ABT). The new model is compared to the previous model using a field case study.

However, unknown wells may exist because innumerable wells were drilled during Pennsylvania's early years of intense oil and gas development when incomplete records were kept of well locations. The concern is that early wells are likely to be unsealed because there were no laws that required effective plugging when the wells were abandoned. Now, many unrecorded wells are thought to be in areas of emerging shale gas and shale oil development where open wellbores might provide a pathway for undesired upward migration of fluids and gas from hydraulically fractured reservoirs. Because of this concern, Pennsylvania regulators have asked operators to locate orphaned and abandoned wells within a 1000-ft- buffer of new wells before hydraulic fracturing. The National Energy Technology Laboratory conducted high-resolution, helicopter magnetic surveys over four large land tracts in western and north-central Pennsylvania where historic oil and gas production has taken place and where unconventional oil and gas resource development is occurring or expected. The project's objective was to evaluate the ability of helicopter magnetic surveys to locate existing wells in heavily vegetated areas of varying terrain. Magnetic surveys locate wells by detecting the unique magnetic signature of vertical, steel well casing, which is depicted on magnetic maps as a ""bull's eye"" type anomaly centered directly over the well. To mitigate for the likelihood that wellbores exist where most or all casing has been removed, this study augmented helicopter magnetic data with supplemental information from farmline maps, state well databases, historic air photos, and digital terrain models generated from LiDAR datasets- all information that is publically available for areas within Pennsylvania. The four surveyed areas include: 1) a 7 km2 (2.7 square mile) tract of privately owned land in Washington County with historic oil and gas production and where gas is now being produced from five, horizontal Marcellus Shale wells; 2) a 17.7 km2 (6.8 square mile) area of state owned land (Hillman State Park) in Washington County with historic oil and gas production and where the uppermost well casings were often cut off or buried by 1950's era surface coal mining; 3) a 28 km2 (10.8 square mile) block of state-owned land in the Susquehannock State Forest of Potter County where gas was once produced from the Oriskany Sandstone, but it is now a gas storage field; and 4) a 37.7 km2 (14.6 square mile) area of state owned land (Oil Creek State Park) in Venango County, which contains more than 900 known wells, including some of the oldest oil wells in the United States. Ground surveys to confirm well targets from the helicopter magnetic surveys have been completed for two of the four areas flown including: 1) the private land tract in Washington County, PA with Marcellus Shale development and 2) the area in Susquehannock State Forest that is now a gas storage field. At the private land tract in Washington County, the helicopter magnetic survey identified 13 well-type magnetic anomalies within 1000 ft of the five horizontal Marcellus wells located there. The ground investigation confirmed that nine well-type magnetic anomalies were wells while four magnetic anomalies were found to arise from non well sources. One additional well with a weak (initially overlooked) magnetic anomaly was found using historical air photos. Of nine confirmed wells, six wells had recorded locations in Pennsylvania's statewide oil and gas wells database (PA∗IRIS/WIS). However, the PA∗IRIS/WIS locations were sometimes too inaccurate for the wells to be located in the dense underbrush. At the gas storage field in Susquehannock State Forest, the helicopter magnetic survey identified 81 magnetic anomalies, including 55 well-type magnetic anomalies. A subsequent ground investigation confirmed that 30 of the 55 well-type magnetic anomalies were well locations. All confirmed wells except one were listed in the PA∗IRIS/WIS state oil and gas well database and the locations provided were sufficiently accurate to locate the well in the field. The helicopter magnetic survey also identified two gas transmission pipelines with pulsed cathodic protection and multiple short pipeline segments without cathodic protection. Helicopter magnetic surveys identified 192 well-type magnetic anomalies within Hillman State Park and 742 well- type magnetic anomalies within Oil Creek State Park. The ground investigation to confirm well locations in the two state parks had not commenced at the time of this report. Preliminary observations from this study are: 1. the PA∗IRIS/WIS well database is incomplete for wells drilled between 1890 and 1920, the era of early well drilling at the Washington County Marcellus Area. Only six of nine confirmed wells were listed in this database. 2. the PA∗IRIS/WIS well database contained 29 of 30 wells found by the helicopter magnetic survey at the gas storage field in Susquehannock State Forest. Wells in this area were drilled post-1950 to produce from and store natural gas in the Oriskany Sandstone. This area contains active gas storage wells and plugged and abandoned gas wells. 3. high resolution magnetic surveys acquired from low-flying aircraft provide accurate locations for wells with steel casing. However, wells with no steel casing exhibit weak or no magnetic anomaly. 4. the inspection of publically available historic air photos or LiDAR imagery for well signatures can sometimes augment helicopter magnetic surveys by identifying well locations where the steel casing was recovered for reuse or salvage. 5. complete casing strings are not needed for detection by helicopter magnetic survey although the minimum casing requirement for detection is not known.

The use of coiled tubing, coupled with a milling bottom hole assembly, is often used to remove these plugs and restrictions after fracturing operations are completed. The costs associated with the milling operations are often scrutinized by the operators as they can increase dramatically if the strategy for each aspect of the milling process is poorly designed. Implementing a technical approach to the optimization of treating fluids and BHA selection throughout the entire milling process has resulted in significant improvements in plug milling efficiencies over traditional methods. In this paper, traditional plug milling methods are reviewed and compared with optimized methods. The physics, chemistry, equipment and procedures behind this optimized strategy, and their effect on key performance indicators are analyzed. A case history is presented from a challenging shale formation in the Horn River basin of northeast British Columbia where new methods significantly reduced both time and cost to the operator.

The recent shale gas revolution, coupled with low domestic natural gas prices, has led many operators in the US to consider export of their gas to more lucrative markets in Asia and Europe. More than 25 LNG projects have been proposed in the US, totaling a capacity of more than 200 MTPA. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has approved five LNG terminals in the US. Most experts believe US LNG export capabilities will be about 10% of domestic production in the coming years, which puts LNG export estimates between 6 and 8 Bscf/D. The question remains, where will all of this gas come from? The vast amount of increased gas production in the onshore US will come from growth in the shale gas plays. These plays, including the Barnett, Fayetteville, Woodford, Marcellus, Haynesville, Eagle Ford, and others, will be further exploited to supply domestic needs and the new LNG export demand. A typical proposed US LNG train is estimated to output 4.5 MTPA, which requires an input of around 636 MMscf/D. It will take a significant quantity of shale gas wells to deliver enough gas to keep a train at full capacity. This paper addresses the impact that LNG- driven natural gas demand will have on the future development of shale gas plays in the US. Increased demand on domestic US natural gas supplies will be met with increased development drilling. In order to quantify the impact of LNG exports on the market, this paper considers the number of horizontal shale gas wells needed to supply one LNG train continuously. Shale gas basins around the US were studied to estimate both the number of wells needed to supply a train initially and the number and frequency of future wells that will need to be drilled to maintain the train at full capacity. Current activities, including infrastructure and rig counts, decline trends, economics, and drilling times are included in the analysis. This paper discusses the impact future increased LNG gas demand will have on the field development plans of shale gas plays and identifies probable future activity levels in shale gas basins due to exploitation activity focused on LNG supply. The feasibility of LNG export from the US is a topic of debate, and this paper will provide context and rationale for the discussions.

This means that the vapor and liquid saturation curves, critical temperatures, pressures and densities of fluid in confinement are different from their well-documented bulk state values. While these single-component studies have been influential in our understanding of this peculiar phenomenon, the multi-component fluid phase behavior has yet to be investigated in depth. This is an important step, because production of liquids and natural gases from organic rich nanoporous shales involves fluids with a wide range of composition. Nanopore walls have significantly varying degrees of affinity to each component (selective adsorption). Consequently there will be large gradients across the pore width in not only density and pressure but also in concentration. This work is an investigation of phase changes of single and multi-component fluids in confinement with the help of molecular simulation. In the first part of this paper, phase diagrams of three single component (pure) fluids in confinement are constructed and studied. In the next part, a different methodology is utilized to construct phase diagrams of binary and ternary mixtures with light, intermediate and heavy hydrocarbon components. The methodologies are initially explained and verified by the bulk-state fluid behavior. This study shows that the behavior of single component fluids approaches its bulk state at a confinement of approximately 13nm width. Furthermore, the impact of confinement appears to be greater on the vapor saturation curve than on the liquid curve. In the case of multi-component fluids, the phase diagrams seem to shift more severely with the increase of the percentage of light component in the mixture. Contrast in concentrations of the light and heavy components, amplifies the confinement effect. More specifically, confined multi-component fluids with high percentage of light components such as methane and ethane are expected to exhibit more dramatic changes in phase behavior. Lastly, critical temperature and pressures of confined mixtures obtained from our molecular simulations are compared to those obtained from other mixing rules and equations, such as Peng-Robinson equation of state, which are extensively used for fluid in bulk state. The differences in values obtained show the necessity for the development of new approaches for considering hydrocarbon fluids in confinement. The observations undermine the current practice of assuming bulk fluid parameters for fluid in shale plays.

Gases released from drill cuttings may provide insight into matrix-bound components of the petroleum system. Cuttings gases commonly exhibit greater compositional and stable isotopic variability relative to mud gases sampled from the same intervals. This variability can be induced by in situ methanogenesis occurring after collection in poorly preserved samples. In such cases, previous work (Rosenau et al. 2014) has shown the thermogenic isotopic signatures of methane to progressively shift to more negative δ13C values, with decreasing gas wetness due to microbial generation of methane. Here we report results from continued monitoring of carbon isotopes in headspace gases of the Piceance Basin cuttings samples from the Rosenau et al. study. New measurements, performed from September to March of 2014, showed continued variation of C1 δ13C values. Surprisingly, the δ13C of methane shifted to less negative values in the samples where microbial activity was evident after approximately 11 months of storage. In all but one of the samples, these values began approach the initially measured values, consistent with a thermogenic source. In the remaining sample, the rebounded δ13C is higher than the initial measurement. More promising, all samples show very little variation of C2-C5 δ13C values throughout the entire course of the study. Time series results from additional samples from the Fort Worth Basin shows both microbial influence as well as C1-C3 δ13C increasing over time. Time series of Appalachian Basin samples show virtually no C1-C3 carbon isotope variation over one year of storage. Overall, these data show cuttings samples can retain the carbon isotopic signature of C1-C5 hydrocarbons for spans greater than 1 year. While methane carbon isotope values are often obscured by microbial processes, that influence may subside over time. While methane δ13C values can be critical data for petroleum system evaluations, the δ13C of ethane and propane, if available, are often more useful for predicting system maturity and evaluating vertical trends. Thus, our results indicate cuttings samples can be of value, even in cases where samples are not well preserved.

This collection of timely chapters presents a nuanced study of environmental toxins and the risks they pose to children’s development. The book details the impact of a number of commonplace environmental toxins, focusing on everyday exposure to tobacco smoke, lead, pesticides, and flame retardants. There is growing recognition that the impact of the environment on children’s health is of critical importance for both current and future generations. In the last half-century, thousands of chemicals have been introduced into the environment with limited-although growing-research on the consequences of exposure. It has been proven that children and adolescents are far more vulnerable than adults to these environmental toxins by virtue of children’s behaviors, higher metabolic rate, greater skin area relative to their volume, and still developing organ systems. Increased number of ear infections, poor asthma control, and learning disabilities are just some of the adverse outcomes that have been noted.

Oral clefts, neural tube defects (NTDs), and congenital heart defects (CHD) are the most common classes of birth defects (Parker et al. 2010). These defects are thought to originate in the first trimester as a result of polygenic inherited disease or gene-environment interactions (Brent 2004). Suspected nongenetic risk factors for these birth defects include folate deficiency (Wald and Sneddon 1991), maternal smoking (Honein et al. 2006), alcohol abuse and solvent use (Romitti et al. 2007), and exposure to benzene (Lupo et al. 2010b; Wennborg et al. 2005), toluene (Bowen et al. 2009), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Ren et al. 2011), and petroleum-based solvents, including aromatic hydrocarbons (Chevrier et al. 1996). Associations between air pollution [volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)] and low birth weight and preterm birth have been reported (Ballester et al. 2010; Brauer et al. 2008; Dadvand et al. 2013; Ghosh et al. 2012; Llop et al. 2010). Many of these air pollutants are emitted during development and production of natural gas (referred to herein as NGD), and concerns have been raised that they may increase risk of adverse birth outcomes and other health effects (Colborn et al. 2011; McKenzie et al. 2012).

This study identifies multiple mechanisms by which CS2 contributes to the formation of CO2 in the atmosphere. CS2 and other associated sulfide compounds were found by this study to be present in emissions from unconventional shale gas extraction and processing (E&amp;P) operations. The breakdown products of CS2; carbonyl sulfide (COS), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are indirect greenhouse gases (GHGs) that contribute to CO2 levels in the atmosphere. The heat-trapping nature of CO2 has been found to increase the surface temperature, resulting in regional and global climate change. The purpose of this study is to identify five mechanisms by which CS2 and the breakdown products of CS2 contribute to atmospheric concentrations of CO2. The five mechanisms of CO2 formation are as follows: 1. Chemical Interaction of CS2 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) present in natural gas at high temperatures, resulting in CO2 formation; 2. Combustion of CS2 in the presence of oxygen producing SO2 and CO2; 3. Photolysis of CS2 leading to the formation of COS, CO, and SO2, which are indirect contributors to CO2 formation; 4. One-step hydrolysis of CS2, producing reactive intermediates and ultimately forming H2S and CO2; 5. Two-step hydrolysis of CS2 forming the reactive COS intermediate that reacts with an additional water molecule, ultimately forming H2S and CO2. CS2 and COS additionally are implicated in the formation of SO2 in the stratosphere and/or troposphere. SO2 is an indirect contributor to CO2 formation and is implicated in global climate change. © 2015 SAGE Publications.",carbon dioxide; carbon disulfide; GHG; global climate change,,"Rich, A.L.; Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences, United States; эл. почта: alisa.rich@unthsc.edu",,SAGE Publications Inc.,11786302,,,,English,Environ.

From a chemist’s point of view, making these feedstocks usable involves breaking and making new C-C bonds and transforming C-H bonds into targeted functional groups. Most traditional pathways have achieved this objective by initial C-H bond functionalizations such as radical functionalizations or partial aerobic oxidations, which are then followed by a modifiable sequence of steps to introduce desired functional groups or C-C bonds constructing the desired frameworks. This approach, known as the functional group interconversion strategy, is so fundamentally important to the way organic chemists think about synthesis, that the introductory chapters of organic chemistry textbooks and lectures focus on exactly this sequence: Radical C-H functionalizations (halogenations) are followed by substitution and elimination reactions, carboxyl and carbonyl chemistry, as well as oxidations and reductions. © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Crude oil; Feedstocks; Aerobic oxidations; C-C bonds; Elimination reaction; Functionalizations; Interconversions; Oil and natural gas; Organic Chemistry; Organic molecules; Synthesis (chemical),"Emmert, M.H.; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, United States",,CRC Press,,9781482233117; 9781482233100,,,English,C-H Bond Activation in Org.

For complex field development and production operations optimization, integrated reservoir performance models constrained with well and surface network pressure must be considered. Alternatively, numeric simulation-driven forecasting methods provide an advanced level of subsurface response however they require intensive model tuning effort which may not be practical for a large number of wells with limited reservoir data. The objective of this effort was to develop an automated workflow to generate production forecasts in the context of integrated reservoir to facilities production modeling. We leveraged on reservoir analytic models and gradient based optimization to identify associated model parameters. Since gradient-based optimization required the specification of an initial guess, we used case-based reasoning to focus on the most relevant parameters and to select better initial guesses a smaller solution range to narrow possible solutions. The proposed solution was successfully tested in a large tight-gas field with approximately 250 wells and a long production history. For this field, rate-transient-analysis models provided certain advantages as they captured field performance response using pressure vs. rate fundamental modeling with the tuning of few parameters. Decline curve models were used as inputs to derive a full physics-based reservoir and well performance models therefore translating time-dependent models into fully pressure and time dependent models. The identified parameters, such as reservoir pressure, well permeability and well drainage radius provided the means to generate full physics well responsive models. The calibrated reservoir and well models were able to reproduce production history with minimum error as well as to provide a means to optimize production using an integrated reservoir, well and facilities production model, which were not possible using decline curve models alone.

The focus of the chapter is in olfaction, given dearth of empiric research on the effects of neurotoxic chemical exposures on the sense of taste, i.e., sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and savory sensations. As will be apparent from the chapter, numerous neurotoxins - many of which are encountered in industrial workplaces - alter the ability to smell, including solvents, metals, and particulate matter. The olfactory system is particularly vulnerable to such agents since its receptors are more or less directly exposed to the outside environment. Importantly, some such agents can enter the brain via the olfactory nerve or surrounding perineural spaces, bypassing the blood-brain barrier and damaging central nervous system structures and inducing pathologic processes that appear to be similar to those seen in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",Assessment; Neurotoxins; Occupational medicine; Olfaction; Poisoning; Psychophysics; Sensory perception; Taste; Xenobiotics,neurotoxin; complication; human; Olfaction Disorders; Taste Disorders; toxicity and intoxication; Humans; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Neurotoxins; Olfaction Disorders; Taste Disorders,"Doty, R.L.; Smell and Taste Center, 5 Ravdin Pavilion, 3400 Spruce Street, United States; эл. почта: Richard.doty@uphs.upenn.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,00729752,,,26563795.0,English,Handb.

Method: In this study, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter levels, wind speed and wind direction values of Düzce city center obtained from the web page of Ministry of Envoriment and Planning between 1 January -31 December 2014 were studied. Data were examined by on the time of hours, days, days of the week, months and seasons. Results: Annual average PM10 was 106,42±102 μg/m3, SO2 concentration was 6,15±5,39 μg/m3. Winter PM10 and SO2 measurements were significantly higher than summer season. Wind speed in th e summer season had a higher average than the winter season. Highest average PM10 was at November 189,4 ± 171,8 μg/m3. The lowest PM10 was at June 58,0±24,5 μg/m3. The highest average wind speed was at June, the lowest average wind speed is at December. PM10 and SO2 measurements were positively correlated with wind direction, shows a negative correlation with wind speed. The highest PM10 measurements in the summer season were on Thursdays, in the winter season on Wednesdays. The lowest PM10 measurements both in two seasons were on Sundays. Average PM10 was significantly higher on weekdays than weekends. The highest PM10 value of 146,6 ± 131,3 μg/m3 was measured at 23.00. The lowest PM10 value of 73,8±55,9 μg/m3 was measured at 15.00. Conclusion: There is air pollution in Düzce both in the summer and winter. Continuous monitoring of the emissions of existing establishments in the industrial pollution control should be provided. The high PM10 measurements in the evening may be due to traffic during the day and fuel use for heating purposes. Widespread use of natural gas and creating socially conscious individual measures can be effective in reducing air pollution. © GATA.",Air pollution; Particulate matter; Seasonal variation,sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air pollution; Article; parameters; particulate matter; season; summer; Turkey (republic); wind direction; wind speed; winter,"Zoroğlu, G.; Halk Sağlığı Anabilim Dalı, Turkey; эл. почта: gulsumzoroglu@gmail.com",,Gulhane Military Medical Academy,1303734X,,,,Turkish,TAF Prev.

In this study, we consider environmental controls on microbial populations in coal-bearing strata of the Cherokee basin, an unconventional natural gas resource in southeast Kansas, USA. Pennsylvanian-age strata in the basin contain numerous thin (0.4-1.1 m) coalbeds with marginal thermal maturities (0.5-0.7% Ro) that are interbedded with shale and sandstone. We collected gas, water, and microbe samples from 16 commercial coalbed methane wells for geochemical and microbiological analysis. The water samples were Na-Cl type with total dissolved solids (TDS) content ranging from 34.9 to 91.3 g L-1. Gas dryness values [C1/(C2 + C3)] averaged 2640 and carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of methane differed from those of carbon dioxide and water, respectively, by an average of 65 and 183%. These values are thought to be consistent with gas that formed primarily by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Results from cultivation assays and taxonomic analysis of 16S rRNA genes agree with the geochemical results. Cultivable methanogens were present in every sample tested, methanogen sequences dominate the archaeal community in each sample (avg 91%), and few archaeal sequences (avg 4.2%) were classified within Methanosarcinales, an order of methanogens known to contain methylotrophic methanogens. Although hydrogenotrophs appear dominant, geochemical and microbial analyses both indicate that the proportion of methane generated by acetoclastic methanogens increases with the solute content of formation water, a trend that is contrary to existing conceptual models. Consistent with this trend, beta diversity analyses show that archaeal diversity significantly correlates with formation water solute content. In contrast, bacterial diversity more strongly correlates with location than solute content, possibly as a result of spatial variation in the thermal maturity of the coalbeds. © 2015 Kirk, Wilson, Marquart, Zeglin, Vinson and Flynn.",Acetoclastic methanogenesis; Cherokee basin; Coal biodegradation; Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis; Natural gas; Unconventional reservoir,coal; Article; controlled study; electric conductivity; gas field; gene sequence; geochemical analysis; ion pair chromatography; mass spectrometry; methanogen; methanogenesis; microbial diversity; nonhuman; pH; polymerase chain reaction; redundancy analysis; river basin; temperature; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; United States,"Kirk, M.F.; Department of Geology, United States; эл. почта: mfkirk@ksu.edu",,Frontiers Research Foundation,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

The likelihood of nonadherence to treatment was greatest among male patients. The following factors led to a greater likelihood of nonadherence to treatment: patients living in a home without running water; head of household without medical insurance; need to use more than one means of transport to reach the health center; place of residence in an area with a high proportion of households connected to the natural gas network; place of residence in an area where a large proportion of families fall below the minimum threshold of subsistence capacity; place of residence in an area where a high proportion of households do not have flushing toilets and basic sanitation.

Baseline and trend morbidity and mortality data need to be collected to assess changes in population health over time. To date, few health or epidemiological studies have been conducted, so it remains difficult to assess actual health outcomes. • In the absence of scientific consensus, there are two possible risks: failing to develop unconventional natural gas when the harms are manageable; or developing it when the harms are substantial.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the biggest cause of disability and premature death throughout the world. Aim. The aim of this study was to describe and determine the prevalence of major cardiovascular risk factors emerged at the first medical examination carried out by a group of an oil and gas contractor company workers in the observation period 2000-2010. Methods. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 1073 workers (mean age 41 years, SD = 9.5) presenting overweight BMI (body mass index) values, hypertension and cholesterol problems. Results. In particular, we found that workers > 45 years had significant higher risk to have obesity (OR = 3.8, CI 95% = 2.5-5.7), hypertension (OR = 2.7, CI 95% = 2.1-3.6), high blood fasting glucose (OR = 2.6, CI 95% = 1.2-5.5), high cholesterol (OR = 2.7, CI 95% = 2.0-3.6), high triglycerides (OR = 1.8, CI 95% = 1.4-2.4) compared to younger (< 45 years).",Cardiovascular risk; Dyslipidemia; Hypertension; Oil company workers,natural gas; petroleum; adult; age; body mass; Cardiovascular Diseases; cross-sectional study; female; human; industry; Italy; male; middle aged; occupational exposure; prevalence; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Age Factors; Body Mass Index; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Industry; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Natural Gas; Occupational Exposure; Petroleum; Prevalence; Risk Factors,"Mannocci, A.; Dipartimento di Sanità Pubblica E Malattie Infettive, Sapienza Università di Roma, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, Italy",,Istituto Superiore di Sanita,00212571,,AISSA,26156186.0,English,Ann.

However, natural radioactivity found in the large volumes of “produced fuids” generated by these technologies is emerging as an international environmental health concern. Current assessments of the radioactivity concentration in liquid wastes focus on a single element—radium. However, the use of radium alone to predict radioactivity concentrations can greatly underestimate total levels. oBjective: We investigated the contribution to radioactivity concentrations from naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM), including uranium, thorium, actinium, radium, lead, bismuth, and polonium isotopes, to the total radioactivity of hydraulic fracturing wastes. Methods: For this study we used established methods and developed new methods designed to quantitate NORM of public health concern that may be enriched in complex brines from hydraulic fracturing wastes. Specifically, we examined the use of high-purity germanium gamma spectrometry and isotope dilution alpha spectrometry to quantitate NORM. results: We observed that radium decay products were initially absent from produced fuids due to diferences in solubility. However, in systems closed to the release of gaseous radon, our model predicted that decay products will begin to ingrow immediately and (under these closed-system conditions) can contribute to an increase in the total radioactivity for more than 100 years. conclusions: Accurate predictions of radioactivity concentrations are critical for estimating doses to potentially exposed individuals and the surrounding environment. Tees predictions must include an understanding of the geochemistry, decay properties, and ingrowths kinetics of radium and its decay product radionuclides. © 2015, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Chemical hazards are created during the exploitation of all minerals, but in the case of shale gas production, there is much more uncertainty as regards to the effects of new technologies application. American experience suggests the increasing risk of environmental contamination, mainly groundwater. The greatest concern is the incomplete knowledge of the composition of fluids used for fracturing shale rock and unpredictability of long-term effects of hydraulic fracturing for the environment and health of residents. High population density in the old continent causes the problem of chemical hazards which is much larger than in the USA. Despite the growing public discontent data on this subject are limited. First of all, there is no epidemiological studies to assess the relationship between risk factors, such as air and water pollution, and health effects in populations living in close proximity to gas wells. The aim of this article is to identify and discuss existing concepts on the sources of environmental contamination, an indication of the environment elements under pressure and potential health risks arising from shale gas extraction. © Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine.",Air; Groundwater; Health hazard; Hydraulic fracturing; Shale gas,"natural gas; water pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; health; human; mining; oil and gas field; pollution; prevention and control; procedures; risk assessment; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; United States; water pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Extraction and Processing Industry; Global Health; Humans; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; United States; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Pakulska, D.; Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof.

Elevated levels of heavy metals in the environment lead to their accumulation in different tissues of hares. The authors have tested accumulation and distribution of several metals in hare liver, kidney, and muscle tissues. The accumulation of copper in hare liver and kidneys with concomitant decrease of zinc was observed in animals from Podravina region as opposed to the control group of animals (Island Krk, Croatia). Secondly, the expression of metallothioneins was assessed because of their crucial role in metal homeostasis. Observed elevation of metallothionein expression in tested organs emphasizes the possible prolonged negative effects of heavy metals in the surroundings as well as a state of oxidative stress in animals. Further monitoring of the area is necessary for better control of hydrocarbon processing to diminish the possible negative environmental effects. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",copper; environment; hares; metallothionein; zinc,copper; hydrocarbon; iron; manganese; metal; metallothionein; natural gas; peroxidase; zinc; metal; metallothionein; animal tissue; Article; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; controlled study; Croatia; gas field; homeostasis; immunohistochemistry; kidney; Lepus europaeus; liver; muscle tissue; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; animal; drug effects; gene expression; genetics; hare; male; metabolism; oil and gas field; tissue distribution; Animalia; Lepus; Lepus europaeus; Animals; Croatia; Gene Expression; Hares; Male; Metallothionein; Metals; Oil and Gas Fields; Tissue Distribution,"Tota, M.; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Rijeka, Brace Branchetta 20, Croatia",,Taylor and Francis Inc.,19338244,,,24965325.0,English,Archiv.

Predictors of self-reported exposure frequency were identified to aid future refinements of an expert-based job-exposure-time matrix (JEM). We focus here on reported frequencies for skin contact with oil and diesel; exposure to oil vapor from shaker, to exhaust fumes, vapor from mixing chemicals used for drilling, natural gas, chemicals used for water injection and processing, and to solvent vapor. Exposure frequency was reported by participants as the exposed proportion of the work shift, defined by six categories, in their current or last position offshore (between 1965 and 1999). Binary Poisson regression models with robust variance were used to examine the probabilities of reporting frequent exposure (≥&frac14; vs. <&frac14; of work shift) according to main activity, time period, supervisory position, type of company, type of installation, work schedule, and education. Holding a non-supervisory position, working shifts, being employed in the early period of the offshore industry, and having only compulsory education increased the probability of reporting frequent exposure. The identified predictors and group-level patterns may aid future refinement of the JEM previously developed for the present cohort. © Copyright 2015 JOEH, LLC.",Carcinogens; Health hazards; Inhalation; Petroleum industry; Skin contact,"air pollutant; carcinogen; exhaust gas; petroleum; solvent; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollutant; epidemiology; exhaust gas; female; human; male; middle aged; mining; Norway; occupational exposure; self report; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; very elderly; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Carcinogens; Extraction and Processing Industry; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Norway; Occupational Exposure; Petroleum; Self Report; Solvents; Vehicle Emissions","Grimsrud, T.K.; Department of Research, Cancer Registry of Norway, P.O.

Ensuring the sustainability of EMS systems requires an empirical understanding of the total energy requirements of EMS operations. This study was undertaken to determine the life cycle energy requirements of US EMS systems. Methods Input-output-based energy requirement multipliers for the US economy were applied to the annual budgets for a random sample of 19 metropolitan or county-wide EMS systems. Calculated per capita energy requirements of the EMS systems were used to estimate nationwide EMS energy requirements, and the leading energy sinks of the EMS supply chain were determined. Results Total US EMS-related energy requirements are estimated at 30 to 60 petajoules (1015 J) annually. Direct (""scope 1"") energy consumption, primarily in the form of vehicle fuels but also in the form of natural gas and heating oil, accounts for 49% of all EMS-related energy requirements. The energy supply chain - including system electricity consumption (""scope 2"") as well as the upstream (""scope 3"") energy required to generate and distribute liquid fuels and natural gas - accounts for 18% of EMS energy requirements. Scope 3 energy consumption in the materials supply chain accounts for 33% of EMS energy requirements. Vehicle purchases, leases, maintenance, and repair are the most energy-intense components of the non-energy EMS supply chain (23%), followed by medical supplies and equipment (21%). Conclusion Although less energy intense than other aspects of the US healthcare system, ground EMS systems require substantial amounts of energy each year. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Acute exposure to high levels of H2S is life threatening while long-term exposure to ambient levels of H2S elicits human health effects.Objective: To study the harmful effects of long-term exposure to low levels of H2S on human blood cells.Methods: 110 adult workers from Iran who were occupationally exposed to 0–90 ppb H2S for 1–30 years were studied. The participants aged between 18 and 60 years and were exposed directly or indirectly to sulfur compounds (exposed group). The origin of H2S was natural gas processing plants. A control group consisting of 110 males who were not in contact with H2S was also studied. For all participants, hematological profile including total hemoglobin and red blood cell count and sulfhemoglobin, methemoglobin levels were measured.Results: Among all parameters evaluated in this study the mean methemoglobin and sulfhemoglobin levels were significantly higher among workers who were exposed to sulfur compounds than the control group. Major differences throughout the study period for sulfhemoglobinemia among exposed groups were observed. Conclusion: Long-term exposure to even low levels of H2S in workplaces may have potential harmful effects on human health. © 2015, Int J Occup Environ Med.

Methods: We conducted a hypothesis-generating health symptom survey of 492 persons in 180 randomly selected households with ground-fed wells in an area of active natural gas drilling. Gas well proximity for each household was compared with the prevalence and frequency of reported dermal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological symptoms.Results: The number of reported health symptoms per person was higher among residents living < 1 km (mean ± SD, 3.27 ± 3.72) compared with > 2 km from the nearest gas well (mean ± SD, 1.60 ± 2.14; p = 0.0002). In a model that adjusted for age, sex, household education, smoking, awareness of environmental risk, work type, and animals in house, reported skin conditions were more common in households < 1 km compared with > 2 km from the nearest gas well (odds ratio = 4.1; 95% CI: 1.4, 12.3; p = 0.01). Upper respiratory symptoms were also more frequently reported in persons living in households < 1 km from gas wells (39%) compared with households 1-2 km or > 2 km from the nearest well (31 and 18%, respectively) (p = 0.004). No equivalent correlation was found between well proximity and other reported groups of respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal conditions.Conclusion: Although these results should be viewed as hypothesis generating, and the population studied was limited to households with a ground-fed water supply, proximity of natural gas wells may be associated with the prevalence of health symptoms including dermal and respiratory conditions in residents living near natural gas extraction activities. Further study of these associations, including the role of specific air and water exposures, is warranted. © 2014, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Methods: Using publicly available data on all reported vehicle crashes in Pennsylvania, we compared accident rates in counties with and without shale gas drilling, in periods with and without intermittent drilling (using data from 2005 to 2012). Counties with drilling were matched to non-drilling counties with similar population and traffic in the pre-drilling period. Results: Heavily drilled counties in the north experienced 15-23% higher vehicle crash rates in 2010-2012 and 61-65% higher heavy truck crash rates in 2011-2012 than control counties. We estimated 5-23% increases in crash rates when comparing months with drilling and months without, but did not find significant effects on fatalities and major injury crashes. Heavily drilled counties in the southwest showed 45-47% higher rates of fatal and major injury crashes in 2012 than control counties, but monthly comparisons of drilling activity showed no significant differences associated with drilling.

Recent trends in gas poisoning suicides outside Asia have received little attention. Methods We analysed suicides by gassing in England and Wales (2001-2011) using national suicide mortality data enhanced by free text searching of information sent by coroners to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). We conducted specific searches for suicides involving barbecue charcoal gas, helium, and hydrogen sulphide. We analysed coroners' records of eight people who used helium as a method of suicide, identified from systematic searches of the records of four coroners. Results Gassing accounted for 5.2% of suicide deaths in England and Wales during 2001-2011. The number of gas suicides declined from 368 in 2001 to 174 by 2011 (a 53% reduction). The fall was due to a decline in deaths involving car exhaust and other sources of carbon monoxide. There was a rapid rise in deaths due to helium inhalation over the period, from five deaths in the two year period 2001-2002 to 89 in 2010-2011 (a 17-fold increase). There were small rises in deaths involving hydrogen sulphide (0 cases in 2001-2002 versus 14 cases in 2010-2011) and barbecue charcoal gas (1 case in 2001-2002 versus 11 cases in 2010-2011). Compared to individuals using other methods, those suicides adopting new types of gas for suicide were generally younger and from more affluent socioeconomic groups. The coroners' records of four of the eight individuals dying by helium inhalation whose records were reviewed showed evidence of Internet involvement in their choice of method. Limitations We were not able to identify the source of carbon monoxide (car exhaust or barbecue charcoal) for over 50% of cases. Conclusion Increases in helium inhalation as a method of suicide have partially offset recent decreases in suicide by the use of car exhaust. Public health measures are urgently needed to prevent a potential epidemic rise in the use of helium similar to the recent rises in charcoal burning suicides in East Asia. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here we evaluate HF vulnerability by comparing HF water demand with supply in the semiarid Texas Eagle Ford play, the largest shale oil producer globally. Current HF water demand (18 billion gallons, bgal; 68 billion liters, bL in 2013) equates to ∼16% of total water consumption in the play area. Projected HF water demand of ∼330 bgal with ∼62 000 additional wells over the next 20 years equates to ∼10% of historic groundwater depletion from regional irrigation. Estimated potential freshwater supplies include ∼1000 bgal over 20 yr from recharge and ∼10 000 bgal from aquifer storage, with land-owner lease agreements often stipulating purchase of freshwater. However, pumpage has resulted in excessive drawdown locally with estimated declines of ∼100-200 ft in∼6% of the western play area since HF began in 2009-2013. Nonfreshwater sources include initial flowback water, which is ≤5% of HF water demand, limiting reuse/recycling. Operators report shifting to brackish groundwater with estimated groundwater storage of 80 000 bgal. Comparison with other semiarid plays indicates increasing brackish groundwater and produced water use in the Permian Basin and large surface water inputs from the Missouri River in the Bakken play. The variety of water sources in semiarid regions, with projected HF water demand representing ∼3% of fresh and ∼1% of brackish water storage in the Eagle Ford footprint indicates that, with appropriate management, water availability should not physically limit future shale energy production. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Brackish water; Groundwater; Hydraulic fracturing; Shale gas; Unconventional energy; Water energy nexus; Water scarcity,Aquifers; Arid regions; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydraulic fracturing; Oil shale; Purchasing; Shale; Shale gas; Shale oil; Surface waters; Water levels; Water supply; Brackish ground water; Brackish water; Groundwater depletion; Groundwater storage; Oil and gas production; Unconventional energy; Water energy; Water scarcity; Water conservation; brackish water; hydraulic fracture; natural gas; power generation; resource depletion; semiarid region; vulnerability; water availability; water demand; water use; Missouri River; Permian Basin; United States,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919490664

Among the non-technical losses occurring in natural gas networks, fraudulent residential consumption is one of the main factors. Up to 2014, gas meters that are most widely used in residential monitoring are manufactured with ferromagnetic moving components, which makes it possible to alter or disrupt the operation of the meters non-intrusively by placing permanent magnets on the casing of the meters. Magnetic remanence mapping was used to investigate a sample of 80 recalled residential meters and detect potentially fraudulent activity. 10% of the meters were found suspect by magnetic remanence measurement, of which 50% were confirmed to be potentially hijacked by further mechanical investigation.

Thus, there is a need to identify the key factors affecting the climate effects of natural gas versus coal electricity production, and to present these climate effects in as clear and transparent a way as possible. Here, we identify power plant efficiencies and methane leakage rates as the factors that explain most of the variance in greenhouse gas emissions by natural gas and coal power plants. Thus, we focus on the role of these factors in determining the relative merits of natural gas versus coal power plants. We develop a simple model estimating CO2 and CH4 emissions from natural gas and coal power plants, and resulting temperature change. Simple underlying physical changes can be obscured by abstract evaluation metrics, thus we focus our analysis on the time evolution of global mean temperature. We find that, during the period of plant operation, if there is substantial methane leakage, natural gas plants can produce greater near-term warming than coal plants with the same power output. However, if methane leakage rates are low and power plant efficiency is high, natural gas plants can produce some reduction in near-term warming. In the long term, natural gas power plants produce less warming than would occur with coal power plants. However, without carbon capture and storage natural gas power plants cannot achieve the deep reductions that would be required to avoid substantial contribution to additional global warming. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Carbon capture; Coal; Electric power generation; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Carbon capture and storage; Coal electricities; Evaluation metrics; Global-mean temperature; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Natural gas power plants; Power plant efficiency; Temperature changes; Gas plants; carbon sequestration; climate effect; coal; coal-fired power plant; electricity generation; global warming; greenhouse gas; leakage; methane; natural gas,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924034471

They enable increases in oil and gas production, but there has been inadequate attention to human health impacts. Air quality near oil and gas operations is an underexplored human health concern for five reasons: (1) prior focus on threats to water quality; (2) an evolving understanding of contributions of certain oil and gas production processes to air quality; (3) limited state air quality monitoring networks; (4) significant variability in air emissions and concentrations; and (5) air quality research that misses impacts important to residents. Preliminary research suggests that volatile compounds, including hazardous air pollutants, are of potential concern. This study differs from prior research in its use of a community-based process to identify sampling locations. Through this approach, we determine concentrations of volatile compounds in air near operations that reflect community concerns and point to the need for more fine-grained and frequent monitoring at points along the production life cycle. Methods: Grab and passive air samples were collected by trained volunteers at locations identified through systematic observation of industrial operations and air impacts over the course of resident daily routines. A total of 75 volatile organics were measured using EPA Method TO-15 or TO-3 by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Formaldehyde levels were determined using UMEx 100 Passive Samplers. Results: Levels of eight volatile chemicals exceeded federal guidelines under several operational circumstances. Benzene, formaldehyde, and hydrogen sulfide were the most common compounds to exceed acute and other health-based risk levels. Conclusions: Air concentrations of potentially dangerous compounds and chemical mixtures are frequently present near oil and gas production sites. Community-based research can provide an important supplement to state air quality monitoring programs. © 2014 Macey et al.",Benzene; Community monitoring; Formaldehyde; Grab and passive samples; Hydraulic fracturing; Hydrogen sulfide; Oil and gas,benzene; hydrogen sulfide; natural gas; oil; volatile agent; air pollutant; volatile organic compound; air quality; air sampling; atmospheric pollution; benzene; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; formaldehyde; gas production; health impact; health risk; hydraulic fracturing; hydrogen sulfide; oil production; public health; volatile organic compound; water quality; air monitoring; air pollutant; air quality; air sampling; Article; community; concentration (parameters); equipment design; exploratory research; mass fragmentography; priority journal; United States; air pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; mining; oil and gas field; participatory research; United States; Air Pollutants; Community-Based Participatory Research; Environmental Monitoring; Extraction and Processing Industry; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Oil and Gas Fields; United States; Volatile Organic Compounds,"Carpenter, D.O.; Institute for Health and the Environment, United States; эл. почта: dcarpenter@albany.edu",,BioMed Central Ltd.,1476069X,,,25355625.0,English,Environ.

To estimate the effect of policies on market clearing prices, we constructed hourly economic dispatch models of the generators in PJM and in ERCOT. We find that the cost effectiveness of policies for consumers is strongly dependent on the price of natural gas and on the characteristics of the generators in the dispatch stack. If gas prices are low (∼$4/MMBTU), a technology-agnostic, rational consumer seeking to minimize costs would prefer a carbon price over an RPS in both regions. Expensive gas (∼$7/MMBTU) requires a high carbon price to induce fuel switching and this leads to wealth transfers from consumers to low carbon producers. The RPS may be more cost effective for consumers because the added energy supply lowers market clearing prices and reduces CO2 emissions. We find that both policies have consequences in capacity markets and that the RPS can be more cost effective than a carbon price under certain circumstances: continued excess supply of capacity, retention of nuclear generators, and high natural gas prices. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",capacity markets; carbon price; cost effectiveness; natural gas; renewable portfolio standards; restructured markets; wind energy,Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Electric generators; Electric load dispatching; Gases; Natural gas; Power markets; Scheduling; Wind power; Capacity markets; Carbon dioxide mitigation; Carbon price; Market Clearing Price; Nuclear generators; Policy instruments; Renewable portfolio standard; Restructured electricity markets; Costs; cost-benefit analysis; electricity supply; environmental economics; environmental policy; price dynamics; United States,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928712066

There is scant literature focused on non-fatal injuries among drilling contractors, some of which have introduced engineering controls to improve rig efficiency and reduce injury risk. Methods: We compared injury rates on new and old technology rigs operated by the largest U.S. drilling contractor during 2003-2012, stratifying by job type and grouping outcomes by injury severity and body part affected. Results: Six hundred seventy-one injuries were recorded over 77.4 million person-hours. The rate on new rigs was 66% of that on old rigs. Roughnecks had lower injury rates on new rigs, largely through reduced limb injury rates. New rigs had lower rates in each non-fatal injury severity category. Conclusions: For this company, new technology rigs appear to provide a safer environment for roughnecks. Future studies could include data from additional companies. Am. J. Ind.

We model the effect of different gas supplies on the US power sector and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Across a range of climate policies, we find that abundant natural gas decreases use of both coal and renewable energy technologies in the future. Without a climate policy, overall electricity use also increases as the gas supply increases. With reduced deployment of lower-carbon renewable energies and increased electricity consumption, the effect of higher gas supplies on GHG emissions is small: cumulative emissions 2013-55 in our high gas supply scenario are 2% less than in our low gas supply scenario, when there are no new climate policies and a methane leakage rate of 1.5% is assumed. Assuming leakage rates of 0 or 3% does not substantially alter this finding. In our results, only climate policies bring about a significant reduction in future CO2emissions within the US electricity sector. Our results suggest that without strong limits on GHG emissions or policies that explicitly encourage renewable electricity, abundant natural gas may actually slow the process of decarbonization, primarily by delaying deployment of renewable energy technologies. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",climate change; decarbonization; natural gas; renewable energy,Decarbonization; Natural gas; Renewable energies; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity generation; energy efficiency; environmental policy; gas supply; natural gas; pollution control; renewable resource; sustainable development; United States,"Shearer, C.; Department of Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine, Croul HallUnited States",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489318,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907698211

Whereas uncertainty is defined as lack of knowledge and can potentially be reduced by additional research, variability is an inherent characteristic of supply chains and cannot be reduced without physically modifying the system. The life-cycle included four stages: production, processing, transmission and power generation, and utilized a functional unit of 1 kWh of electricity generated at plant. Technological variability requires analyses of life cycles of individual power plants, e.g. combined cycle plants or boilers. Parameter uncertainty was modeled via Monte Carlo simulation. Our approach reveals that technological differences are the predominant cause for the range of LCGHG emissions associated with gas power, primarily due to variability in plant efficiencies. Uncertainties in model parameters played a minor role for 100 year time horizon. Variability in LCGHG emissions was a factor of 1.4 for combined cycle plants, and a factor of 1.3 for simple cycle plants (95% CI, 100 year horizon). The results can be used to assist decision-makers in assessing factors that contribute to LCGHG emissions despite uncertainties in parameters employed to estimate those emissions. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; natural gas; uncertainty; variability,Combined cycle power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Monte Carlo methods; Natural gas; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Gas-fired electricity generation; Inherent characteristics; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Parameter uncertainty; uncertainty; Uncertainty and variability; variability; Life cycle,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905216431

A questionnaire was administered to adult volunteers with medical complaints in a primary-care medical office in a county where UNGD was present. Participants were asked whether they were concerned about health effects from UNGD, and whether they attributed current symptoms to UNGD or to some other environmental exposure. There were 72 respondents; 22% perceived UNGD as a health concern and 13% attributed medical symptoms to UNGD exposures. Overall, 42% attributed one or more of their medical symptoms to environmental causes, of which UNGD was the most frequent. A medical record review conducted on six participants who attributed their medical symptoms to UNGD revealed that only one of these records documented both the symptoms in question and the attribution to UNGD. The results of this pilot study suggest that there is substantial concern about adverse health effects of UNGD among Pennsylvania Marcellus Shale residents, and that these concerns may not be adequately represented in medical records. Further efforts to determine the relationship between UNGD and health are recommended in order to address community concerns. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Health perceptions; Hydraulic fracturing; Marcellus shale; Medical records; Patient concerns; Pennsylvania; Symptoms; Unconventional natural gas development,field survey; health impact; hydraulic fracture; natural gas; perception; public health; shale; symptom; adult; article; descriptive research; environmental factor; exploratory research; female; health center; health survey; human; male; medical record review; mental health; perception; primary medical care; public health service; questionnaire; self report; Unconventional Natural Gas Development; United States; attitude to health; environmental exposure; epidemiology; health status indicator; medical audit; middle aged; mining; oil and gas field; pilot study; procedures; Pennsylvania; United States; natural gas; Attitude to Health; Environmental Exposure; Extraction and Processing Industry; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Medical Audit; Middle Aged; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Pennsylvania; Pilot Projects; Questionnaires,"Saberi, P.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology, University of Pennsylvania Health Systems, One Convention Ave, 4 Penn Tower, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States; эл. почта: poune@psrphila.org",,MDPI AG,16617827,,,25003172.0,English,Int.

The model enables the assessment of risk for people who live in the vicinity of these stations and complements the existing models for risk assessment on natural gas pipelines. It is based on risk assessment methods suggested in relevant guides, recommendations and standards. Explosion and jet fire are considered as major hazardous events and are modelled according to analytical models and empirical data. Local or other accessible databases are used for modelling of event frequencies and ignition probabilities. A case study on a sample station is carried out. For each hazardous event, fault tree and event tree analysis is performed. Results show influence of each hazardous event on the whole risk relative to the distance from the hazardous source. Ventilation is found to be a significant factor in determination of risk magnitude; its influence on individual risk is presented in a quantitative way. The model should be of use for pipeline operators as well as for environmental- and urban planners. © 2013.",Explosion; Jet fire; Metering-regulation station; Natural gas; Risk assessment,Event tree analysis; Ignition probability; Jet fire; Metering stations; Metering-regulation station; Natural ventilation; Quantitative risk assessment; Risk assessment methods; Explosions; Natural gas; Ventilation; Risk assessment; natural gas; article; environmental monitoring; gas analysis; gas flow; health hazard; mathematical model; population risk; priority journal; quantitative analysis; quantitative risk assessment; risk assessment; risk factor,"Bajcar, T.; University of Ljubljana, Aškerčeva 6, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; эл. почта: tom.bajcar@fs.uni-lj.si",,,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

However, scintillation cells are sometimes used for measuring 222Rn in natural gas or carbon dioxide. The counting efficiencies of scintillation cells for measurements of 222Rn in these gases should be different from those for measuring 222Rn in air because the ranges of alpha particles emitted by 222Rn and its progeny are greater in methane and smaller in carbon dioxide than in air. If these effects are not taken into consideration, measurements of 222Rn in natural gas will be biased high and in carbon dioxide will be biased low. The authors previously investigated the effects of barometric pressure on measurements of 222Rn in air using scintillation cells. A modeling technique was used in a previous study to calculate theoretical errors that would result if atmospheric pressure were not considered. In the current study, the same modeling technique was used to calculate theoretical errors that would be made for measurements of 222Rn in methane and carbon dioxide if the calibration for 222Rn in air were used. Results are presented for four types of scintillation cells of varying geometries and for barometric pressures representative of four elevations ranging from sea level to 1,963 m (6,440 feet). These results indicate that the errors introducedby the ranges of the alpha particles in gases different from air can be significant. Depending on the type of cell and the local pressure, a measurement of 222Rn in methane may be biased high by 2-7%, while a measurement of 222Rn in CO2 may be biased low by 15-20% if the calibration for 222Rn in air is used.

Few studies have documented the soil degradation and heavy metal contamination caused by pipeline construction. In this study, chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) levels were evaluated using Index of Geo accumulation (Igeo) and Potential Ecological Risk Index (RI) values, and human health risk assessments were used to elucidate the level and spatial variation of heavy metal pollution risks. The results showed that the impact zone of pipeline installation on soil heavy metal contamination was restricted to pipeline right of way (RoW), which had higher Igeo of Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb than that of 20 m and 50 m. RI showed a declining tendency in different zones as follows: trench &gt; working zone &gt; piling area &gt; 20 m &gt; 50 m. Pipeline RoW resulted in higher human health risks than that of 20 m and 50 m, and children were more susceptible to non carcinogenic hazard risk. Cluster analysis showed that Cu, Ni, Pb and Cd had similar sources, drawing attention to the anthropogenic activity.

Approximately 300 employees were present at the time of the explosion, when natural gas being vented during the repair of a hot water heater ignited. The concussion from the explosion led to structural failure in multiple locations and breached additional natural gas, electrical, and ammonia lines that ran overhead in the 1-story concrete industrial plant. Intent is the major difference between this type of accident and a terrorist using an incendiary device to terrorize a targeted population.

No reports of significant acute toxic responses to the ETAs were noted; however, it would be expected that severe skin and eye irritation could result from contact with concentrated monoethanolamine and, to a much lesser extent, diethanolamine. Standardized animal and human tests of allergic sensitization to the ETAs have been negative, but sporadic case reports of human sensitization and a low incidence of sensitization in specific work groups of dermatitis patients have been reported. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Propane is classified as an aliphatic hydrocarbon. It is a colorless, odorless gas that is sparingly soluble in water. Because of its volatility, it would have a propensity to migrate to the atmosphere following an environmental release and would not pose a hazard to the food web. Human exposure would most likely occur by inhalation. Propane is practically nontoxic and would primarily cause death in humans by displacing oxygen and subsequently causing asphyxiation. Some toxicity at lower levels may be caused by a nonspecific narcosis (similar to volatile anesthetic compounds). This narcotic form of toxicity would be anticipated following an acute exposure of humans and/or animals to relatively high levels in air (similar to other petroleum solvents), whereas chronic exposures to lower levels appear to be insignificant. Propane is not mutagenic and there are no indications that it is a carcinogen. Clinical management following exposure would consist of moving the victim away from the source and into fresh air (e.g., outdoors).

It is essential for the survival of living organisms, and is used as an industrial reagent, asphyxiant, and toxicant. It can also be a liquefied compressed gas, or white flakes or cubes. In solid form, it is used as dry ice. Carbon dioxide can be found naturally in springwater, and is released when volcanoes erupt, trees are cut down, and organisms breathe. Burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, gasoline, natural gas, and diesel fuel also produce significant amount of CO2. Carbon dioxide is recycled in the ecosystem through respiration, photosynthesis, and combustion. The ambient atmospheric CO2 sustains respiration and homeostasis of blood pH in animals and humans. Symptoms of carbon dioxide toxicity include high blood pressure, flushed skin, headache, and twitching muscles. Exposure to higher levels can cause panic, irregular heartbeat, hallucinations, vomiting, and potentially unconsciousness or even death. An increase in the concentration of CO2 in blood leads to toxicity by decreasing the pH (respiratory acidosis), initially stimulating then depressing respiration, cardiac activity, arrhythmias, and death.

Measurements of these changes began in 1959 with the International Geophysical Year where CO2 was measured atop Mauna Loa in Hawaii. CO2 measurements were 316 ppm in 1959, and annual averages have increased until 2010 where it was 389.8 ppm. In 2010 the increase was 2.4 ppm, the largest 1-year increase recorded since 1998. CO2 represents about 63 % of the greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases reflect infrared radiation back to the earth's surface causing a warming effect. Global warming has a major effect on climate over time which differentiates climate change from weather which is short-term changes over hours or days. CO2 has major sinks such as the oceans and peat bogs across the Arctic and taiga, and CO2 is utilized by plants and forests in metabolism. Anthropogenic sources through burning oil and natural gas for transportation or heating, burning of forest lands for slash and burn agriculture, or burning coal have emitted CO2 increasing substantially since the industrial revolution. This has been efficiently stored in CO2 sinks. Only over the past 50 years have anthropogenic sources been prodigious enough to actually exceed the natural sinks and increase the global recordings of greenhouse gases and temperature. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

Increasingly, there is a realization that utilization of the fossilized carbon sources has adverse environmental consequences in the form of increasing concentration of greenhouse gases. We are also becoming aware of the limited nature of these resources. As a result, considerable efforts are being made to produce chemicals and fuels from renewable resources such as forest products, agricultural residues and plant products. All of these systems capture solar energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide as a part of the natural carbon cycle. Serious research efforts are also underway, targeting cultivation of photosynthetic autotrophic microbes for the production of biomass and lipids. In this category, algae appears to offer the most potential for capturing solar energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide and delivering sufficient quantities of biomass/lipids that can offset the fossilized carbon utilization in a meaningful manner without impacting food output adversely. However, several advances, both technologically as well as politically, are needed before we can realize its full potential. It is also clear that a biorefinery approach must be undertaken in order to harvest renewable energy and chemicals from algae economically.

VOCs are also emitted from oil and gas fields and diesel exhaust. Additional sources of release are paints, glues, and other products that are used and stored at home and at work.VOCs when combined with nitrogen oxides react to form ground-level ozone, or smog, which contributes to climate change. Gasoline, benzene, formaldehyde, toluene, xylene, styrene, and perchloroethylene (or tetrachloroethylene used in dry cleaning) are also rich sources of VOCs. Irritation to skin and eye, sensitization, central nervous system effects, carcinogenicity, and liver and kidney effects have been reported in experimental animals and humans.

Microbial community analyses showed significant reductions in species richness as well as evenness in sites with Marcellus shale activity. Beta diversity analyses revealed distinct microbial community structure between sites with and without Marcellus shale activity. For example, OTUs within the Acetobacteracea, Methylocystaceae, Acidobacteriaceae, and Phenylobacterium were greater than three log-fold more abundant in MSA+ sites as compared to MSA- sites. Further, several of these OTUs were strongly negatively correlated with pH and positively correlated with the number of wellpads in a watershed. It should be noted that many of the OTUsenriched in MSA+ sites are putative acidophilic and/or methanotrophic populations. This studyrevealed apparent shifts in the autochthonous microbial communities and highlighted potential members that could be responding to changing stream conditions as a result of nascentindustrial activity in these aquatic ecosystems.",,carbon; natural gas; RNA 16S; Acetobacteraceae; aquatic environment; Article; biofilm; community structure; controlled study; DNA extraction; gene sequence; high throughput sequencing; isotope analysis; Methylocystaceae; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; oil shale; pH; polymerase chain reaction; Proteobacteria; RNA gene; species richness; structural bioinformatics; United States; watershed; Acidobacteriaceae; bryophytes; Methylocystaceae; Otus; Phenylobacterium,"Lamendella, R.; Juniata College, 1700 Moore Street, United States; эл. почта: lamendella@juniata.edu",,Frontiers Media S.A.,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

Some of these factors include low natural gas prices, rising labor costs and declining productivity, economic competition with other coal mining regions, environmental regulations to reduce pollution and safeguard public health, state energy efficiency and renewable electricity standards, falling costs of renewable energy resources like wind and solar, and the likely prospect of future limits on greenhouse gas emissions. This analysis uses an input-output model to examine the effects on West Virginia's economy from these multiple factors by exploring a range of scenarios for coal production through 2020. In addition to changes in the coal industry, hypothetical investments in additional sectors of the economy are considered as a way to gauge potential alternative economic opportunities.

In typical risk analysis, systems are usually modeled as discrete and Boolean variables with constant failure rates via fault trees. Nevertheless, in many cases, it is not possible to perform an efficient analysis using only discrete and Boolean variables. The approach put forward by the proposed methodology makes use of BNs and incorporates recent developments that facilitate the use of continuous variables whose values may have any probability distributions. Thus, this approach makes the methodology particularly useful in cases where the available data for quantification of hazardous events probabilities are scarce or nonexistent, there is dependence among events, or when nonbinary events are involved. The methodology is applied to the risk analysis of a regasification system of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on board an FSRU (floating, storage, and regasification unit). LNG is becoming an important energy source option and the world's capacity to produce LNG is surging. Large reserves of natural gas exist worldwide, particularly in areas where the resources exceed the demand. Thus, this natural gas is liquefied for shipping and the storage and regasification process usually occurs at onshore plants. However, a new option for LNG storage and regasification has been proposed: the FSRU. As very few FSRUs have been put into operation, relevant failure data on FSRU systems are scarce. The results show the usefulness of the proposed methodology for cases where the risk analysis must be performed under considerable uncertainty. © 2014 Society for Risk Analysis.",Bayesian networks; FSRU; LNG regasification; Reliability analysis; Risk analysis,Bayesian networks; Digital storage; Floating liquefied natural gas; Gas fuel purification; Gas plants; Iterative methods; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Probability distributions; Proven reserves; Reliability analysis; Risk assessment; Risks; Uncertainty analysis; Constant failure rate; Continuous variables; Efficient analysis; Floating storage and regasification units; FSRU; Hybrid Bayesian networks; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); LNG regasification; Risk analysis; natural gas; Bayes theorem; risk assessment; Bayes Theorem; Natural Gas; Risk Assessment,"Martins, M.R.; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering Department, University of São Paulo, Av.

Release of CH4 into the atmosphere contributes to climate change. Biological CH4 production or methanogenesis is mostly performed by methanogens, a group of strictly anaerobic archaea. The direct substrates for methanogenesis are H2 plus CO2, acetate, formate, methylamines, methanol, methyl sulfides, and ethanol or a secondary alcohol plus CO2. In numerous anaerobic niches in nature, methanogenesis facilitates mineralization of complex biopolymers such as carbohydrates, lipids and proteins generated by primary producers. Thus, methanogens are critical players in the global carbon cycle. The same process is used in anaerobic treatment of municipal, industrial and agricultural wastes, reducing the biological pollutants in the wastes and generating methane. It also holds potential for commercial production of natural gas from renewable resources. This process operates in digestive systems of many animals, including cattle, and humans. In contrast, in deep-sea hydrothermal vents methanogenesis is a primary production process, allowing chemosynthesis of biomaterials from H2 plus CO2. In this report we present Gene Ontology (GO) terms that can be used to describe processes, functions and cellular components involved in methanogenic biodegradation and biosynthesis of specialized coenzymes that methanogens use. Some of these GO terms were previously available and the rest were generated in our Microbial Energy Gene Ontology (MENGO) project. A recently discovered non-canonical CH4 production process is also described. We have performed manual GO annotation of selected methanogenesis genes, based on experimental evidence, providing ""gold standards"" for machine annotation and automated discovery of methanogenesis genes or systems in diverse genomes.

On July 27, 2012, the Alabama Department of Public Health requested Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologic assistance investigating possible health effects resulting from airborne exposure to mercaptan from a contaminated groundwater spring, identified in January 2012.Objective: To assess the self-reported health effects in the community, to determine the scope of the reported medical services received, and to develop recommendations for prevention and response to future incidents.Design: In September 2012, we performed a representative random sampling design survey of households, comparing reported exposures and health effects among residents living in 2 circular zones located within 1 and 2 miles from the contaminated source.Setting: Eight Mile community, Prichard, Alabama.Participants: We selected 204 adult residents of each household (=18 years) to speak for all household members.Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported mercaptan odor exposure, physical and mental health outcomes, and medical-seeking practices, comparing residents in the 1- and 2-mile zones.Results: In the past 6 months, 97.9% of respondents in the 1-mile zone and 77.6% in the 2-mile zone reported mercaptan odors. Odor severity was greater in the 1-mile zone, in which significantly more subjects reported exposures aggravating their physical and mental health including shortness of breath, eye irritations, and agitated behavior. Overall, 36.5% sought medical care for odor-related symptoms.Conclusions: Long-term odorous mercaptan exposures were reportedly associated with physical and psychological health complaints. Communication messages should include strategies to minimize exposures and advise those with cardiorespiratory conditions to have medications readily available. Health care practitioners should be provided information on mercaptan health effects and approaches to prevent exacerbating existing chronic diseases.

However, the rapid expansion of UNGD has also raised concerns about its potential impacts on public health. Academics and government agencies are developing research programs to explore these concerns. Community involvement in activities such as planning, conducting, and communicating research is widely recognized as having an important role in promoting environmental health. Historically, however, communities most often engage in research after environmental health concerns have emerged. This community information needs assessment took a prospective approach to integrating community leaders' knowledge, perceptions, and concerns into the research agenda prior to initiation of local UNGD. We interviewed community leaders about their views on environmental health information needs in three states (New York, North Carolina, and Ohio) prior to widespread UNGD. Interviewees emphasized the cumulative, long-term, and indirect determinants of health, as opposed to specific disease outcomes. Responses focused not only on information needs, but also on communication and transparency with respect to research processes and funding. Interviewees also prioritized investigation of policy approaches to effectively protect human health over the long term. Although universities were most often cited as a credible source of information, interviewees emphasized the need for multiple strategies for disseminating information. By including community leaders' concerns, insights, and questions from the outset, the research agenda on UNGD is more likely to effectively inform decision making that ultimately protects public health. © 2014 by De Gruyter 2014.",community participation; environmental health; hydraulic fracturing; research agendas,"natural gas; environmental exposure; female; human; infant; male; newborn; public health; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Natural Gas; Public Health","Korfmacher, K.S.; Department of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester, 601 Elmwood Ave, Box EHSC, United States",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,00487554,,REVHA,25204212.0,English,Rev.

An inspection of the pathophysiological effects of acute toxic actions reveals that current environmental monitoring protocols are incompatible with the goal of protecting the health of those living and working near UNGD activities. The intensity, frequency, and duration of exposures to toxic materials in air and water determine the health risks to individuals within a population. Currently, human health risks near UNGD sites are derived from average population risks without adequate attention to the processes of toxicity to the body. The objective of this paper is to illustrate that current methods of collecting emissions data, as well as the analyses of these data, are not sufficient for accurately assessing risks to individuals or protecting the health of those near UNGD sites. Focusing on air pollution impacts, we examined data from public sources and from the published literature. We compared the methods commonly used to evaluate health safety near UNGD sites with the information that would be reasonably needed to determine plausible outcomes of actual exposures. Such outcomes must be based on the pathophysiological effects of the agents present and the susceptibility of residents near these sites. Our study has several findings. First, current protocols used for assessing compliance with ambient air standards do not adequately determine the intensity, frequency or durations of the actual human exposures to the mixtures of toxic materials released regularly at UNGD sites. Second, the typically used periodic 24-h average measures can underestimate actual exposures by an order of magnitude. Third, reference standards are set in a form that inaccurately determines health risk because they do not fully consider the potential synergistic combinations of toxic air emissions. Finally, air dispersion modeling shows that local weather conditions are strong determinates of individual exposures. Appropriate estimation of safety requires nested protocols that measure real time exposures. New protocols are needed to provide 1) continuous measures of a surrogate compound to show periods of extreme exposure; 2) a continuous screening model based on local weather conditions to warn of periodic high exposures; and 3) comprehensive detection of chemical mixtures using canisters or other devices that capture the major components of the mixtures. © 2014 by De Gruyter 2014.",acute toxic actions; toxic materials; unconventional natural gas development (UNGD),air pollutant; natural gas; air pollutant; analysis; environmental exposure; human; policy; public health; quality of life; research; vulnerable population; water quality; Air Pollutants; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Natural Gas; Public Health; Public Policy; Quality of Life; Research; Vulnerable Populations; Water Quality,"Brown, D.; Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project, 4198 Washington Road, United States",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,00487554,,REVHA,24690938.0,English,Rev.

Every stage of UOG operation from well construction to extraction, operations, transportation, and distribution can lead to air and water contamination. Hundreds of chemicals are associated with the process of unconventional oil and natural gas production. In this work, we review the scientific literature providing evidence that adult and early life exposure to chemicals associated with UOG operations can result in adverse reproductive health and developmental effects in humans. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [including benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX) and formaldehyde] and heavy metals (including arsenic, cadmium and lead) are just a few of the known contributors to reduced air and water quality that pose a threat to human developmental and reproductive health. The developing fetus is particularly sensitive to environmental factors, which include air and water pollution. Research shows that there are critical windows of vulnerability during prenatal and early postnatal development, during which chemical exposures can cause potentially permanent damage to the growing embryo and fetus.

However, significant concerns have arisen due to the lack of research on the public health impact of UNGDO.Objectives: Environmental Health Sciences Core Centers (EHSCCs), funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), formed a working group to review the literature on the potential public health impact of UNGDO and to make recommendations for needed research.Discussion: The Inter‑EHSCC Working Group concluded that a potential for water and air pollution exists that might endanger public health, and that the social fabric of communities could be impacted by the rapid emergence of drilling operations. The working group recommends research to inform how potential risks could be mitigated.Conclusions: Research on exposure and health outcomes related to UNGDO is urgently needed, and community engagement is essential in the design of such studies.

Methanogens are responsible for synthesis of most of the methane found on Earth. The enzyme responsible for catalyzing the chemical step of methanogenesis is methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), a nickel enzyme that contains a tetrapyrrole cofactor called coenzyme F430, which can traverse the Ni(I), (II), and (III) oxidation states. MCR and methanogens are also involved in anaerobic methane oxidation. This review describes structural, kinetic, and computational studies aimed at elucidating the mechanism of MCR. Such studies are expected to impact the many ramifications of methane in our society and environment, including energy production and greenhouse gas warming. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",F430; methane oxidation; methanogenesis; nickel; tetrapyrrole,,"Ragsdale, S.W.; Department of Biological Chemistry, United States",,Springer London,15590836,,,25416393.0,English,Met.

The different settings needed to condition these sources in stainless steel capsules, working area setup, packaging preparation, Ra-226 source characterization, capsule welding, leakage test and data information are completely described. The radium sources addressed in the present work are mainly those which have been used in medicine and for industrial applications, in the form of sealed radiation sources. In Egypt hospitals are among the largest users of sealed radium radioactive sources which are mostly used for brachytherapy. The inventory of radium sources in large hospitals could be in the hundreds. There is a real risk that sources may be lost or mishandled, if very restricted procedures are not followed. An additional problem with these sources is that they are often leaking, due to internal overpressure. The small size of the sources, portability and high apparent value (due to the materials of encapsulation) increase the risk of theft. © EDP Sciences, 2014.",Conditioning; Ra-226; Sealed sources; Waste management,Encapsulation; Hospitals; Natural gas conditioning; Radioactive prospecting; Stainless steel; Waste management; Data informations; Large hospitals; Ra-226; Radiation source; Radioactive sources; Sealed sources; Source characterization; Technical information; Radium,"Lasheen, Y.F.; Hot Labs and Waste Management Center, Atomic Energy Authority, 3 Ahmed El-Zomor St., El-Zohour District, Naser City, 11787, Cairo, Egypt; эл. почта: yasser202000@yahoo.com",,EDP Sciences,00338451,,,,English,Radioprot.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905496528

This paper presents the results of fault displacement monitoring at two sites in the Bohemian Massif and Western Carpathians. These data have been supplemented by radon monitoring in the Mladeč Caves and by carbon dioxide monitoring in the Zbrašov Aragonite Caves. A significant period of tectonic instability is indicated by changes in the fault displacement trends and by anomalous radon and carbon dioxide concentrations. This was recorded around the time of the catastrophic MW = 9.0 Tōhoku Earthquake, which hit eastern Japan on 11 March 2011. It is tentatively suggested that the Tōhoku Earthquake in the Pacific Ocean and the unusual geodynamic activity recorded in the Bohemian Massif and Western Carpathians both reflect contemporaneous global tectonic changes. © The Author 2014.

A single well requires the use of millions of gallons of water and tons of sand. Air sampling results show that the majority of silica levels at hydraulic fracturing sites were above the Occupational Safety and Health Administration allowable standard and 84% were above Occupational Safety and Health Administration's new proposed standard. These exposure levels put workers, particularly sand mover operators and T-belt operators who had the highest levels, at risk of silicosis and the other silica-related conditions of lung cancer, end-stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis, and connective tissue disease. Because of the fracking industry's demand for silica, sand mining has markedly increased, which has also increased the number of workers at risk of developing silicosis and other silica-related conditions in the mining industry. This paper reviews the parts of the country where health care providers should be most concerned about possible patients in their practice who are at risk from this newly recognized source of silica exposure and the appropriate medical testing to perform. However, given the long latency, 20 or more years, of most silica-related health conditions and the fact that fracking did not become widely used until the 2000s, it may be years before health care providers see clinical-related disease in their practices. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",chronic renal failure; connective tissue disease; COPD; hydraulic facturing; lung cancer; oil and natural gas drilling; silicosis; tuberculosis,natural gas; silicon dioxide; article; hydraulic fracturing; occupational exposure; occupational hazard; offshore oil industry; oil shale; risk assessment; silicosis; United States,"Rosenman, K.D.; Department of Medicine, Michigan State University, 909 Fee Road, West Fee, East Lansing, MI 48824, United States; эл. почта: rosenman@msu.edu",,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,10680640,,CPMEF,,English,Clin.

Rapid adoption of these methods has created a surge in natural gas production in the United States and increased public concern about its environmental and human health effects. We surveyed the environmental literature relevant to shale gas development and studied over fifteen well sites and impoundments in West Virginia to evaluate pollution caused by air emissions, light and noise during drilling. Our study also characterized liquid and solid waste streams generated by drilling and hydraulic fracturing and evaluated the integrity of impoundments used to store fluids produced by hydraulic fracturing. While most shale gas wells are completed with little or no environmental contamination, we found that many of the problems associated with shale gas development resulted from inattention to accepted engineering practices such as impoundment construction, improper liner installation and a lack of institutional controls. Recommendations are provided based on the literature and our field studies. They will address not all but a great many of the deficiencies that result in environmental release of contaminants from shale gas development.

The EU is a world leader in the field of biogas, with a production of 10,085.8 ktoe y-1 (in 2011) in terms of primary energy, accounting for about 60% of the world's production. Germany is the EU country that has made the greatest progress in this field with a production of as much as 5,067.6 ktoe y-1, of which a share of 4,414.2 ktoe y-1 results from anaerobic digestion (and co-digestion) processes of selected organic matrices. UK is the second largest producer with 1,764.8 ktoe y-1, determined for 84% by landfill biogas and the remainder by biogas produced in sewage treatment plants (sludge digestion). Italy (1,095.7 ktoe y-1) and France (349.6 ktoe y-1) follow in the list of the largest producers. The trend of biogas production, in accordance with the action lines of the EU, is characterized by a progressive increase from anaerobic digestion (and co-digestion) of selected organic matrices and a progressive decrease from landfills. Production in 2020 is estimated at 28.0 Mtoe y-1 in accordance with the EU Renewable Energy National Plans. The uses of biogas are mainly directed to the production of electricity and heat. There are, however, several cases of conversion of biogas into biomethane injected into the natural gas grids or used as biofuel in vehicles. In this last direction, worthy of note are a few north-central EU countries which have implemented an effective policy to promote the use of biomethane for public and private transport.",Biofuels; Natural gas; Renewable energies,,"Urbini, G.; University of Insubria, Varese, Italy; эл. почта: giordano.urbini@uninsubria.it",,Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi),1980993X,,,,English; Portuguese,Rev.

It also poses a variety of environmental risks, particularly with respect to the management of water resources. We review current scientific understanding of risks associated with the following: water withdrawals for hydraulic fracturing; wastewater treatment, discharge and disposal; methane and fluid migration in the subsurface; and spills and erosion at the surface. Some of these risks are relatively unique to shale gas development, while others are variations of risks that we already face from a variety of industries and activities. All of these risks depend largely on the pace and scale of development that occurs within a particular region. We focus on the United States, where the shale gas boom has been on-going for several years, paying particular attention to the Marcellus Shale, where a majority of peer-reviewed study has taken place. Governments, regulatory agencies, industry, and other stakeholders are challenged with responding to these risks, and we discuss policies and practices that have been adopted or considered by these various groups. Adaptive Management, a structured framework for addressing complex environmental issues, is discussed as a way to reduce polarization of important discussions on risk, and to more formally engage science in policy-making, along with other economic, social and value considerations. Data suggests that some risks can be substantially reduced through policy and best practice, but also that significant uncertainty persists regarding other risks. We suggest that monitoring and data collection related to water resource risks be established as part of planning for shale gas development before activity begins, and that resources are allocated to provide for appropriate oversight at various levels of governance. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.",,"fresh water; ground water; methane; natural gas; storm water; surface water; well water; environmental economics; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; government regulation; industry; information processing; oil shale; polarization; priority journal; review; risk assessment; spillage; surface property; United States; waste disposal; waste gas management; waste water management; water quality; water stress; water supply; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Extraction and Processing Industry; Gas, Natural; Oil and Gas Fields","Rahm, B.G.; New York State Water Resources Institute, Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, United States; эл. почта: bgr4@cornell.edu",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,24664241.0,English,Environ.

We highlight what is currently known and identify data gaps and research limitations by addressing matters of toxicity, exposure pathways, air quality, and water quality. Discussion: There is evidence of potential environmental public health risks associated with shale gas development. Several studies suggest that shale gas development contributes to ambient air concentrations of pollutants known to be associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Similarly, an increasing body of studies suggest that water contamination risks exist through a variety of environmental pathways, most notably during wastewater transport and disposal, and via poor zonal isolation of gases and fluids due to structural integrity impairment of cement in gas wells. Conclusion: Despite a growing body of evidence, data gaps persist. Most important, there is a need for more epidemiological studies to assess associations between risk factors, such as air and water pollution, and health outcomes among populations living in close proximity to shale gas operations.",,environmental chemical; natural gas; air quality; environmental change; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; government; greenhouse gas; human; morbidity; mortality; ozone depletion; pollutant; pollution monitoring; population risk; priority journal; public health; review; shale gas; tight gas; United States; waste disposal; water quality; adverse effects; air pollution; water pollution; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Natural Gas; Public Health; United States; Water Pollution; Water Quality,"Shonkoff, S.

Methods A cross-sectional study was designed to evaluate the respiratory function through spirometry in subjects cooking with biomass or natural gas. All patients were evaluated by a general physician and a pulmonologist. We compared the prevalence of spirometry abnormalities across those cooking with natural gas versus those cooking with biofuel. A multivariable logistic regression and multiple linear regression were used to adjust differences by potential confounding factors. Results 203 subjects were studied. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of severe obstructive pattern (OR 5.50; 95% CI 1.17-25.79) in subjects who cook with biomass compared with natural gas users. Values of forced expired volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were statistically lower among those cooking with biomass. The prevalence of respiratory morbidity and symptoms were not statistically significant between both groups.

With increasing urbanization and supply of improved cooking fuels to urban areas, the high burden of respiratory illnesses in urban populations such as Kamalapur may be reduced by decreasing crowding and improving ventilation in living spaces.

We focus on clinical studies, both epidemiological and experimental, published in the previous 5 years. From a mechanistic perspective, air pollutants probably cause oxidative injury to the airways, leading to infl ammation, remodelling, and increased risk of sensitisation.

We evaluated emergency medical personnel in Çanakkale, Turkey, for their degree of preparedness. Methods A descriptive study was conducted in Çanakkale, Turkey, within 112 emergency service units and their 17 district stations. Surveys were developed to measure the level of preparedness for serious winter conditions that individual workers made for themselves, their homes, and their cars. Results Of the 167 survey participants, the mean age was 29.8 ± 7.9 years; 52.7% were women; more than half (54.75%) were emergency medical technicians; and 53.3% were married. Only 10.4% of those who heated their homes with natural gas had carbon monoxide detectors. Scores relating to household and individual preparation for severe winter conditions increased by participants' age (P <.003), being married (P <.000) and working in the city center (P <.021); and for men whose cars were equipped with tow ropes, extra clothing, and snow tires (P <.05). Absenteeism was higher for central-city personnel than district workers because they were less prepared for harsh winter conditions (P =.016). Conclusion Many of the surveyed emergency health personel demonstrated insufficient preparations for serious winter conditions. To increase the safety and efficiency of emergency medical personnel, educational training programs should be rountinely conducted.

Among these, oil and natural gas production sites all over the world and hundreds of kilometers of coastlines in the more arid regions of Gulf countries are of major concern due to the extent and magnitude of contamination. Because conventional microbiological processes do not function well at elevated salinities, bioremediation of hypersaline environments can only be accomplished using high salt-tolerant microorganisms capable of degrading petroleum compounds. In the last two decades, there have been many reports on the biodegradation of hydrocarbons in moderate to high salinity environments. Numerous microorganisms belonging to the domain Bacteria and Archaea have been isolated and their phylogeny and metabolic capacity to degrade a variety of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons in varying salinities have been demonstrated. This article focuses on our growing understanding of bacteria and archaea responsible for the degradation of hydrocarbons under aerobic conditions in moderate to high salinity conditions. Even though organisms belonging to various genera have been shown to degrade hydrocarbons, members of the genera Halomonas Alcanivorax, Marinobacter, Haloferax, Haloarcula, and Halobacterium dominate the published literature. Despite rapid advances in understanding microbial taxa that degrade hydrocarbons under aerobic conditions, not much is known about organisms that carry out similar processes in anaerobic conditions. Also, information on molecular mechanisms and pathways of hydrocarbon degradation in high salinity is scarce and only recently there have been a few reports describing genes, enzymes and breakdown steps for some hydrocarbons. These limited studies have clearly revealed that degradation of oxygenated and non-oxygenated hydrocarbons by halophilic and halotolerant microorganisms occur by pathways similar to those found in non-halophiles ©2014 Fathepure.",Biodegradation; Halophilic and halotolerant bacteria and archaea; Hypersaline environments; Molecular mechanism of degradation; Oxygenated and non-oxygenated hydrocarbons,aliphatic compound; benzene; benzoic acid derivative; ethylbenzene; hydrocarbon; petroleum; petroleum derivative; phenol derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; toluene; xylene; Alcanivorax; bioremediation; Haloarcula; Halobacterium; Haloferax; Halomonas; hypersaline environment; marine environment; Marinobacter; microbial degradation; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; review,"Fathepure, B.Z.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, 307 Life Sciences East, Stillwater, OK, United States; эл. почта: babu.fathepure@okstate.edu",,Frontiers Research Foundation,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

In this review, we examined current hydraulic fracturing literature including associated wastewater management on quantity and quality of groundwater. We conclude that proper documentation/reporting systems for wastewater discharge and spills need to be enforced at the federal, state, and industrial level. Furthermore, Underground Injection Control (UIC) requirements under SDWA should be extended to hydraulic fracturing operations regardless if diesel fuel is used as a fracturing fluid or not. One of the biggest barriers that hinder the advancement of our knowledge on the hydraulic fracturing process is the lack of transparency of chemicals used in the practice. Federal laws mandating hydraulic companies to disclose fracturing fluid composition and concentration not only to federal and state regulatory agencies but also to health care professionals would encourage this practice. The full disclosure of fracturing chemicals will allow future research to fill knowledge gaps for a better understanding of the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on human health and the environment. © 2014 Jiangang Chen et al.",,"diesel fuel; ground water; surface water; natural gas; article; environmental health; environmental impact; environmental parameters; health care personnel; human; hydraulic fracturing; waste water management; water availability; water quality; water sampling; water supply; energy conservation; environment; legal aspect; mining; review; United States; water quality; Conservation of Energy Resources; Environment; Extraction and Processing Industry; Gas, Natural; Groundwater; United States; Water Quality","Al-Wadei, M.H.; Department of Public Health, 390 HPER Building, University of Tennessee, 1914 Andy Holt Avenue, Knoxville, TN 37996, United States; эл. почта: malwadei@utk.edu",,Hindawi Publishing Corporation,16879805,,,24790614.0,English,J.

In this perspective we focus on how the production of unconventional O & NG affects air quality. We pay particular attention to shale gas as this type of development has transformed natural gas production in the US and is set to become important in the rest of the world. A variety of potential emission sources can be spread over tens of thousands of acres of a production area and this complicates assessment of local and regional air quality impacts. We outline upstream activities including drilling, completion and production. After contrasting the context for development activities in the US and Europe we explore the use of inventories for determining air emissions. Location and scale of analysis is important, as O & NG production emissions in some US basins account for nearly 100% of the pollution burden, whereas in other basins these activities make up less than 10% of total air emissions. While emission inventories are beneficial to quantifying air emissions from a particular source category, they do have limitations when determining air quality impacts from a large area. Air monitoring is essential, not only to validate inventories, but also to measure impacts. We describe the use of measurements, including ground-based mobile monitoring, network stations, airborne, and satellite platforms for measuring air quality impacts. We identify nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds (VOC), ozone, hazardous air pollutants (HAP), and methane as pollutants of concern related to O & NG activities. These pollutants can contribute to air quality concerns and they may be regulated in ambient air, due to human health or climate forcing concerns. Close to well pads, emissions are concentrated and exposure to a wide range of pollutants is possible. Public health protection is improved when emissions are controlled and facilities are located away from where people live. Based on lessons learned in the US we outline an approach for future unconventional O & NG development that includes regulation, assessment and monitoring.

This technique is advantageous for the observation of specimens like biological samples, moist samples, liquids, polymers and ceramics among others [1]. Unlike high vacuum mode (HighVac), the regime pressure of the low vacuum mode (LowVac) stands in the range of 10 to 130 Pa which assist to eliminate the effects of charge accumulation onto the surface and preserve fragile structures (biological samples) as well. The use of this mode of observation to the study of glass-ceramic spherical materials has been evaluated. Also this material was observed applying the HighVac mode in order to compare viewing conditions between both observation modes. The spherical material is obtained from crystalline blast furnace slags (BFS) generated by steelmaking industry [2]. The process involves a natural gas/oxygen thermal projection process and conversion of the BFS precursors into glass-ceramic spheres. The study and characterization of the new glass-ceramic spherical particles is required because their chemical properties depend on the morphology, finally these materials can be incorporated into specific cementing slurries formulation as lightweight aggregates and is expected that they will improve the thermal and acoustic isolation properties of the final concrete and/or cement systems.

The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for elevated serum total IgE infants living in Havana. Methods: Eight hundred and seventy-seven infants provided blood samples. Data on allergic disease symptoms and a wide range of exposures were collected. Results: The median IgE was 35IU/ml (interquartile range 13-96). The risk of having an IgE level above the median was higher for children who had been breastfed for 4 months or more (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.28; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.61) and for children who reported cockroaches in their home (OR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.03-1.63). The risk was lower for children whose mother was in paid employment (OR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.54-0.97 compared with those who did not), for children living in homes where gas and electricity were used for cooking (OR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.32-0.62 compared with electricity only) and for children with domestic pets at birth (OR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70-1.00). There was no association between paracetamol use and serum IgE levels. Conclusions: Associations between gas fuel use and maternal employment indicate that IgE levels in early life are lower in children who may be living in relative affluence. The discrepancy in the effect of early exposure to pets or cockroaches may reflect differences in these allergens, or be confounded by relative affluence. Further investigation of this cohort will determine how these effects translate into the expression of allergic disease in later life. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Allergy; Cuba; IgE; Infants; Risk factor,"immunoglobulin E; paracetamol; allergen; immunoglobulin E; natural gas; allergy; disease prevalence; environmental factor; gene expression; host-pathogen interaction; immune system; pathogenicity; population structure; risk factor; allergic disease; article; blood sampling; child; cockroach; confidence interval; controlled study; cooking; cross-sectional study; Cuba; electricity; employment status; environmental exposure; female; human; infant; major clinical study; male; population based case control study; risk factor; analysis; animal; blood; breast feeding; employment; environmental exposure; heating; hypersensitivity; immunology; indoor air pollution; mother; pet animal; power supply; procedures; risk; statistics and numerical data; Cuba; Havana; La Habana [Cuba]; Blattaria; Air Pollution, Indoor; Allergens; Animals; Breast Feeding; Cockroaches; Cuba; Electric Power Supplies; Employment; Environmental Exposure; Female; Heating; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Infant; Male; Mothers; Natural Gas; Odds Ratio; Pets; Risk Factors","Venero-Fernández, S.J.Infanta No 1158 e/ Llinas y Clavel, Codigo Postal 10300, La Habana, Cuba; эл. почта: silviavf@inhem.sld.cu",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,13602276,,TMIHF,24674274.0,English,Trop.

However, a majority of children do not possess vaccination cards compiling information on timing. We investigated the benefits of vaccination cards for the uptake of immunizations against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT), polio, tuberculosis (BCG), and measles using data on over 200,000 Indian children from the District Level Health and Facility Survey 3. Methodological issues such as whether parents of children with higher morbidity levels may have them vaccinated were investigated. The results from the models for DPT, polio, measles, and BCG vaccinations showed significant beneficial effects of maternal education, household possessions, and access to health care facilities. Moreover, models for children's ages at the time of vaccination showed significant interactions between maternal education and access to and availability of health care facilities. Finally, models for child morbidity due to diarrhea, cough, and fever showed that timely vaccinations against DPT, access to piped water, and cooking with electricity or natural gas were associated with lower morbidity. Overall, issuing paper or electronic vaccination cards to children is likely to enhance timely uptake of various immunizations thereby reducing child morbidity.

Natural gas development (NGD) emits several potential teratogens, and U.S. production of natural gas is expanding. Objectives: We examined associations between maternal residential proximity to NGD and birth outcomes in a retrospective cohort study of 124,842 births between 1996 and 2009 in rural Colorado. Methods: We calculated inverse distance weighted natural gas well counts within a 10-mile radius of maternal residence to estimate maternal exposure to NGD. Logistic regression, adjusted for maternal and infant covariates, was used to estimate associations with exposure tertiles for congenital heart defects (CHDs), neural tube defects (NTDs), oral clefts, preterm birth, and term low birth weight. The association with term birth weight was investigated using multiple linear regression. Results: Prevalence of CHDs increased with exposure tertile, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.3 for the highest tertile (95% CI: 1.2, 1.5); NTD prevalence was associated with the highest tertile of exposure (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.0, 3.9, based on 59 cases), compared with the absence of any gas wells within a 10-mile radius. Exposure was negatively associated with preterm birth and positively associated with fetal growth, although the magnitude of association was small. No association was found between exposure and oral clefts. Conclusions: In this large cohort, we observed an association between density and proximity of natural gas wells within a 10-mile radius of maternal residence and prevalence of CHDs and possibly NTDs. Greater specificity in exposure estimates is needed to further explore these associations.",,"benzene; natural gas; teratogenic agent; natural gas; article; cleft lip; cleft palate; cohort analysis; congenital heart malformation; environmental exposure; female; fetus growth; gas field; human; live birth; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; neural tube defect; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; residential area; retrospective study; United States; chemically induced; cleft palate; Heart Defects, Congenital; Neural Tube Defects; newborn; pregnancy; Premature Birth; risk; toxicity; Cleft Palate; Colorado; Female; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Exposure; Natural Gas; Neural Tube Defects; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Retrospective Studies","McKenzie, L.

We argue that the limit to lifespan may be approaching. Since 1997, no one has exceeded Jeanne Calment's record of 122.5 years, despite an exponential increase of centenarians. Moreover, the background mortality may be approaching a lower limit. We calculate from Gompertz coefficients that further increases in longevity to approach a life expectancy of 100 years in 21st century cohorts would require 50% slower mortality rate accelerations, which would be a fundamental change in the rate of human aging. Looking into the 21st century, we see further challenges to health and longevity from the continued burning of fossil fuels that contribute to air pollution as well as global warming. Besides increased heat waves to which elderly are vulnerable, global warming is anticipated to increase ozone levels and facilitate the spread of pathogens.

This paper focuses on an assessment framework to explicitly calculate the individual risk of high-pressure sour gas wells at the well drilling and completion stages. The method is based on accident probability analysis by fault tree simulation as well as accident consequence analysis through building reasonable accident scenarios for H2S gas diffusion related to death probability within a given distance. The death probability curves of different wind directions and corresponding minimum proximity distances to the surrounding buildings could be provided by probabilistic risk analysis. Finally the individual risk contours could be mapped by concentration interpolation, and be compared with acceptable risk level. The case study in Chinese Sichuan-Chongqing region shows that the minimum proximity distances of different directions range from 600 to 1200m locating between individual risk values of 10-4 and 10-6.

Objective: We quantified pollutant concentrations and occupant exposures resulting from NGCB use in California homes. Methods: A mass-balance model was applied to estimate time-dependent pollutant concentrations throughout homes in Southern California and the exposure concentrations experienced by individual occupants. We estimated nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and formaldehyde (HCHO) concentrations for 1 week each in summer and winter for a representative sample of Southern California homes. The model simulated pollutant emissions from NGCBs as well as NO2 and CO entry from outdoors, dilution throughout the home, and removal by ventilation and deposition. Residence characteristics and outdoor concentrations of NO2 and CO were obtained from available databases. We inferred ventilation rates, occupancy patterns, and burner use from household characteristics. We also explored proximity to the burner(s) and the benefits of using venting range hoods. Replicate model executions using independently generated sets of stochastic variable values yielded estimated pollutant concentration distributions with geometric means varying by &lt; 10%. Results: The simulation model estimated that-in homes using NGCBs without coincident use of venting range hoods-62%, 9%, and 53% of occupants are routinely exposed to NO2, CO, and HCHO levels that exceed acute health-based standards and guidelines. NGCB use increased the sample median of the highest simulated 1-hr indoor concentrations by 100, 3,000, and 20 ppb for NO2, CO, and HCHO, respectively.

The CBNG well water could potentially be very useful in the water-limited regions (e.g., arid and semi-arid), but beneficial uses may be hindered by water quality problems. Objectives of this research were to: (1) examine trend analysis of nine years of CBNG well water at discharge (outfall) points and in corresponding disposal ponds, (2) evaluate geochemical processes, (3) identify potential water quality issues, and (4) find potential beneficial uses. The CBNG well water at discharge points and in corresponding disposal ponds was measured on-site for pH and electrical conductivity (EC). These water samples were also analyzed in the laboratory for calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), cadmium (Cd), and barium (Ba). Total dissolved solids (TDS) were calculated from EC measurements. The sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) was calculated from Na, Ca, and Mg concentrations. Trend analyses of outfalls and disposal ponds were conducted separately so that the differences in trends could be compared. Trends in CBNG well water at discharge points are not always the same as trends in CBNG disposal ponds: environmental and geochemical processes play an important role in the water quality of these well waters. Overall trend analyses suggest that CBNG well water at discharge points in all basins of the Powder River Basin meets beneficial use criteria, except for SAR and to some extent EC, for aquatic life, livestock and wildlife watering, and irrigation. The CBNG well water in disposal ponds across all basins meets criteria for all beneficial uses except for As, pH, SAR, and to some extent EC for irrigation, aquatic life, and livestock and wildlife watering. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"aluminum; arsenic; barium; cadmium; calcium; chromium; coalbed natural gas; copper; iron; magnesium; molybdenum; natural gas; nitrate; potassium; selenium; sodium; sulfate; unclassified drug; well water; adsorption; article; electric conductivity; environmental factor; livestock; pH; pond; priority journal; river basin; soil property; water quality; water sampling; wildlife; Agricultural Irrigation; Desert Climate; Droughts; Gas, Natural; Groundwater; Metals; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical","Reddy, K.J.; Department of Ecosystem Science and Management, , Laramie, WY, United States; эл. почта: katta@uwyo.edu",,,20507887,,,24280972.0,English,Environ.

The reactor is based on the principle of intensifying degradation/disinfection using a combination of hydrodynamic cavitation, acoustic cavitation, ozone injection and electrochemical oxidation/precipitation. Theoretical studies have been presented to highlight the uniform distribution of the cavitational activity and enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals in the cavitation zone, as well as higher turbulence in the main reactor zone. The combination of these different oxidation technologies have been shown to result in enhanced water treatment ability, which can be attributed to the enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals, enhanced contact of ozone and contaminants, and the elimination of mass transfer resistances during electrochemical oxidation/precipitation. Compared to the use of individual approaches, the hybrid reactor is expected to intensify the treatment process by 5-20 times, depending on the application in question, which can be confirmed based on the literature illustrations. Also, the use of Ozonix® has been successfully proven while processing recycled fluids at commercial sites on over 750 oil and natural gas wells during hydraulic operations around the United States. The superiority of the hybrid process over conventional chemical treatments in terms of bacteria and scale reduction as well as increased water flowability and better chemical compatibility, which is a key requirement for oil and gas applications, has been established. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Among the German public there is great concern with regard to the potential environmental impacts of fracking including the contamination of ground water, the most important source of drinking water in Germany. In the present article the risks of ground water contamination through fracking are discussed. Due to the present safety requirements and the obligatory geological and hydrogeological scrutiny of the underground, which has to be performed prior to fracking, the risk of ground water contamination by fracking can be regarded as very low. The toxicity of chemical additives of fracking fluids is discussed. It is recommended that in the future environmental impact assessment and approval of fracs should be performed by the mining authorities in close cooperation with the water authorities.

The aim of this study is to analyze the association between the use of gas cooking at home during pregnancy and respiratory problems in children during their first year of life. Methods. In the years 2003 through 2008 pregnant women were enrolled in 4 Spanish areas and visited in different age-points following a common protocol. Outcomes studied (from a questionnaire) were any episode of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), wheezing, persistent cough, chestiness and otitis. The association between exposure to gas cooking at home and respiratory outcomes was assessed using logistic regression and adjusting by confounding variables. Some potential effect modifiers (i.e. smoking, fruit and vegetables consumption) were examined. Results: Among the 2003 children included in the study, a total of 731 (36.6%) had a LRTI episode, 693 (34.6%) experienced wheezing, 302 (15.5%) a persistent cough, 939 (47.4%) chestiness and 620 (31.2%) had an episode of otitis during their first year of life. Gas cookers were present in 45.5% of homes. Exposure to gas cooking in homes was not associated with respiratory outcomes Odds Ratios (OR) were close to 1 and not statistically significant. However, a positive association was found for otitis among infants whose mothers reported low intakes of fruit and vegetables during pregnancy [OR (95% CI) = 1.38 (1.01-1.9)] and also wheezing and chestiness were associated with gas cookers among those children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. Conclusions: In susceptible subjects (those whose mothers smoke and consumed below average fruit and vegetables) we found an association between exposure to gas cooking during pregnancy and risk of wheezing, chestiness and otitis during the first year of life. But more research is needed regarding not only gas cooking and respiratory health but also the possible effect modifier role of diet and tobacco. © 2013Esplugues et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. © 2013 Esplugues et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Chestiness; Fruit and vegetable consumption; Gas cooking; Infant; Otitis; Pregnancy; Tobacco; Wheezing,"child health; diet; food consumption; food intake; fruit; health impact; neonate; pollution exposure; pregnancy; questionnaire survey; respiratory disease; smoke; tobacco; vegetable; article; child; controlled study; cooking; coughing; disease association; fruit; gas cooking; human; indoor air pollution; lower respiratory tract infection; major clinical study; maternal nutrition; maternal smoking; otitis; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; preschool child; priority journal; progeny; questionnaire; respiratory tract disease; thorax disease; vegetable; wheezing; adult; adverse effects; air pollutant; analysis; clinical trial; cohort analysis; cooking; diet; female; incidence; infant; male; multicenter study; newborn; passive smoking; prenatal exposure; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Spain; toxicity; young adult; Spain; air pollutant; natural gas; passive smoking; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Cohort Studies; Cooking; Diet; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Natural Gas; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Questionnaires; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Spain; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Young Adult","Esplugues, A.; CIBER Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Melchor Fernández Almagro, 3-5, 28029, Madrid, Spain; эл. почта: esplugues_ana@gva.es",,,1476069X,,,24289253.0,English,Environ.

These hazards can be minimised by development of specific radiation protection rules and adequate procedures for the handling, use and storage of radiation sources, which should be established in a national normative framework. Recently, due to discovery of new oil and gas reservoirs on the Brazilian continental shelf, especially in deep water and the pre-salt layerAn aggregation of rocks located offshore of a large portion of the Brazilian coast, with the potential to accumulate oil. This layer was called pre-salt because it forms a rock interval that ranges under an extensive layer of salt which, at certain areas of the coast, can be as much as 2000 m thick. The distance between the surface of the sea and the oil reservoirs under the salt layer can be as much as 7000 m., there has been a large and rapid increase in the use of radiation sources for well logging. Generic radiation protection regulations have been used for licensing the use of radiation sources for well logging, but these are not comprehensive or technically suitable for this purpose. Therefore it is necessary to establish specific Brazilian safety regulations for this purpose. In this work, an assessment is presented of the relevant radiation protection aspects of nuclear well logging not covered by generic regulations, with the aim of contributing to the future development of specific safety regulations for the licensing of radioactive facilities for oil and gas well logging in Brazil.

It remains badly known by the general population. It is the second cause of lung cancer, after tobacco smoking. The aim of this cross-sectional general population survey was to describe radon exposure risk knowledge and the socioeconomic factors related to this knowledge. Materials and methods: The Cancer Barometer survey 2010 questioned the French population about its knowledge of radon as such and as health risk factor. This survey was a two-stage random sampling with computer-assisted telephone interview that was performed from April 3, 2010 to August 7, 2010 on a sample of 3,359 people aged 15 to 75 years old. Results: Among people aged 15 to 75 years old, only one in five knows that radon is a natural gas coming from the ground. This knowledge is more frequent among people living in an area that is directly concerned by radon, among men and increases with age, with the level of education and the level of income. Radon risk remains still widely underestimated by the general public, including in areas concerned by this risk. When people were confronted with radon exposure, few intended to remedy by improving their home. Conclusion: The success of prevention initiatives implies the support and the collaboration of various national and local actors. To improve their impact for the prevention of lung cancers, it could be more effective to couple these actions with prevention messages on tobacco. © 2013 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO).",Environmental health; General population survey; Lung cancer; Radon; Risk perception,"radon; adolescent; adult; aged; article; attitude to health; cross-sectional study; educational status; female; France; high risk population; human; income; major clinical study; male; priority journal; radiation exposure; socioeconomics; Cancer du poumon; Enquête en population générale; Environmental health; General population survey; Lung cancer; Perception du risque; Radon; Risk perception; Santé environnementale; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Educational Status; Environmental Exposure; Female; France; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Income; Male; Middle Aged; Questionnaires; Radon; Risk Assessment; Sex Factors; Young Adult","Beck, F.; Institut national de prévention et d'éducation pour la sante (Inpes), 42, 93203 Saint-Denis cedex, France; эл. почта: francois.beck@inpes.sante.fr",,,12783218,,CARAF,24239031.0,French,Cancer Radiother.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889638822

Often the terms ""petroleum refining"" and ""petrochemical"" are used interchangeably to define processes that occur in complex plants, which grow outdoors on large surfaces and a visual impact is not irrelevant. In reality, the two areas involve potential exposure to different chemical agents, related to raw materials processed and the specific products. The petrochemical uses as raw materials, the oil fractions, obtained by distillation in the refinery, or natural gas; petrochemical products are, usually, single compounds with a specific degree of purity, used as basic raw materials for the entire industry of organic chemistry, from the production of plastics to pharmaceuticals. The oil refining, that is the topic of this paper, processes mainly oil to obtain mixtures of hydrocarbon compounds, the products of which are specified on the basis of aptitude for use. For example gasolines, are obtained by mixing offractions of the first distillation, reforming products, antiknock. The paper illustrates, necessarily broadly due to the complexity of the productive sectors, the technological and organizational changes that have led to a significant reduction of occupational exposure to chemical agents, the results of environmental monitoring carried out in some refineries both during routine conditions that during scheduled maintenance activities with plant shutdown and a store of petroleum products. The chemical agents measured are typical for presence, physico-chemical properties and toxicological characteristics of the manufacturing processes of petroleum products like benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethyl benzene, n-hexane, Volatile Hydrocarbons belonging to gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel.

Using a novel approach, we created a mechanical impingement risk score for each exercise by combining scapular and glenohumeral kinematic and exposure data. In a case series design, 18 individuals (25-76 yr old) with paraplegia and without substantial shoulder pain participated. The mean mechanical impingement risk scores at 45-60 degrees humerothoracic elevation were rank-ordered from lowest to highest risk as per subacromial mechanical impingement risk: overhead press (0.6 +/- 0.5 points), lat pulldown (1.2 +/- 0.5 points), chest press (2.4 +/- 2.8 points), row (2.7 +/- 1.6 points), and rickshaw (3.4 +/- 2.3 points). The mean mechanical impingement risk scores at 105-120 degrees humerothoracic elevation were rank-ordered from lowest to highest risk as per internal mechanical impingement risk: lat pulldown (1.2 +/- 0.5 points) and overhead press (1.3 +/- 0.5 points). In conclusion, mechanical impingement risk scores provided a mechanism to capture risk associated with CRT. The rickshaw had the highest subacromial mechanical risk, whereas the overhead press and lat pulldown had the highest internal mechanical impingement risk. The rickshaw was highlighted as the most concerning exercise because it had the greatest combination of magnitude and exposure corresponding with increased subacromial mechanical impingement risk.",Biomechanics; Circuit resistance training; Conditioning; Exercise; Impingement; Kinematics; Paraplegia; Shoulder; Spinal cord injury; Wheelchair,Circuit resistance; Exercise; Impingement; Paraplegia; Spinal cord injuries (SCI); Biomechanics; Electric resistance; Kinematics; Natural gas conditioning; Shoulders (road); Wheelchairs; Presses (machine tools); adult; aged; article; case study; chest press; circuit resistance training; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; disease association; exercise; female; glenohumeral kinematics; human; humerothoracic elevation angle; in vivo study; internal mechanical impingement risk; kinematics; lat pulldown; male; mechanical impingement risk score; musculoskeletal system parameters; outcome assessment; overhead press; paraplegia; priority journal; resistance training; rickshaw exercise; risk; risk assessment; row exercise; scapular kinematics; scoring system; shoulder impingement syndrome; subacromial mechanical impingement risk; wheelchair; biomechanics; circuit resistance training; conditioning; exercise; impingement; kinematics; paraplegia; shoulder; spinal cord injury; wheelchair; Adult; Aged; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Paraplegia; Resistance Training; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Scapula; Shoulder Impingement Syndrome; Shoulder Joint,"Riek, L.

Chemicals used in the process are known neurotoxins, carcinogens, and endocrine disruptors. People who live near shale gas drilling sites report symptoms that they attribute to contaminated air and water. When they seek help from clinicians, a diagnosis is often elusive because the chemicals to which the patients have been exposed are a closely guarded trade secret. Many nurses have voiced grave concern about shale gas drilling safety. Full disclosure of the chemicals used in the process is necessary in order for nurses and other health professionals to effectively care for patients. The economic exuberance surrounding natural gas has resulted in insufficient scrutiny into the health implications. Nursing research aimed at determining what effect unconventional drilling has on human health could help fill that gap.

However, this topic has received relatively little attention compared to As behaviour in soils and biotransformation through the trophic level in the marine and terrestrial environment. We believe this is due to long-standing misconceptions regarding volatile As stability and transport as well as an absence, until recently, of appropriate sampling methods. First and foremost, an attempt is made to unify arsines' designations, notations and formulas, taking into account all the different terms used in the literature. Then, the stability of As volatile species is discussed and new analytical developments are explored. Further, the special cases of diffuse low-level emissions (e.g. soil and sediment biovolatilisation), and point sources with high-level emissions (geothermal environments, landfills, and natural gas) are comprehensively reviewed. In each case, future possible areas of research and unknown mechanisms are identified and their importance towards the global As biogeochemical cycle is explored. This review gathers new information regarding mechanisms, stability, transport and sampling of the very elusive arsines and shows that more research should be conducted on this important process. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,arsenic; arsine; fresh water; olive oil; peroxy radical; s adenosylmethionine; volatile agent; anaerobic digestion; atomic fluorescence spectrometry; biogeochemical cycle; biological monitoring; bioremediation; comparative study; cyanobacterium; DNA damage; drug stability; gas chromatography; hemoglobinuria; hemolytic anemia; jaundice; landfill; lichen (organism); lung carcinogenesis; mass spectrometer; methylation; nonhuman; occupational exposure; oxidation reduction potential; priority journal; review; Scopulariopsis brevicaulis; sediment; sewage treatment plant; soil amendment; spectrofluorometry; volatilization; Animals; Arsenic; Arsenic Poisoning; Arsenicals; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Equipment Design; Humans,"Feldmann, J.; TESLA (Trace Element Speciation Laboratory), , Aberdeen AB24 3UE, United Kingdom; эл. почта: j.feldmann@abdn.ac.uk",,,20507887,,,23824266.0,English,Environ.

However, associations of central olfactory measures with clinical outcome parameters have not been simultaneously studied in large samples of schizophrenia patients.Methods: In the framework of the comprehensive phenotyping of the GRAS (Göttingen Research Association for Schizophrenia) cohort, we modified and extended existing odor naming (active memory retrieval) and interpretation (attribute assignment) tasks to evaluate them in 881 schizophrenia patients and 102 healthy controls matched for age, gender and smoking behavior. Associations with emotional processing, neuropsychological test performance and disease outcome were studied.Results: Schizophrenia patients underperformed controls in both olfactory tasks. Odor naming deficits were primarily associated with compromised cognition, interpretation deficits with positive symptom severity and general alertness. Contrasting schizophrenia extreme performers of odor interpretation (best versus worst percentile; N=88 each) and healthy individuals (N=102) underscores the obvious relationship between impaired odor interpretation and psychopathology, cognitive dysfunctioning, and emotional processing (all p<0.004).Conclusions: The strong association of performance in higher olfactory measures, odor naming and interpretation, with lead symptoms of schizophrenia and determinants of disease severity highlights their clinical and scientific significance. Based on the results obtained here in an exploratory fashion in a large patient sample, the development of an easy-to-use clinical test with improved psychometric properties may be encouraged. © 2013 Kästner et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Cognition; Higher olfactory processing; Odor interpretation; Odor naming; Positive symptoms,chlorpromazine; gasoline; natural gas; adult; article; attention; blunted affect; cognitive defect; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; executive function; female; Glycyrrhiza; human; major clinical study; male; neuropsychological test; odor; pineapple; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; positive syndrome; rose; schizophrenia; smoking; task performance; verbal memory; working memory; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Odors; Olfaction Disorders; Olfactory Perception; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology,"Ehrenreich, H.; Clinical Neuroscience, Hermann-Rein-Str.3, 37075 Göttingen, Germany; эл. почта: ehrenreich@em.mpg.de",,,1471244X,,BPMSC,24229413.0,English,BMC Psychiatry,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883136596

A suitable alternative is to produce it from Jatropha curcas, which has high quality oil concentration. Nevertheless, the presence of particular chemical elements above certain limits can affect the product quality, leading to vehicle engine problems and acting as air pollution source. The objective of this work is to develop a method for the simultaneous determination of B, Na, Mg, P, S, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ba, and Pb in J. curcas seeds, oil and biodiesel using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique. This material was evaluated because has been successfully employed in India for biodiesel production as well as in other places where there is an incentive to family farming, without affect the food chain. The oil was obtained from seeds via mechanical extraction and the biodiesel was achieved by oil transesterification. After optimization of the microwave digestion method for the different sample types, the samples were analyzed by ICP-MS. The certified reference material NIST SRM 1515 (apple leaves) and the recovery tests were carried out to ensure the accuracy of the proposed method, which made possible the quantification of several nutrients and potentially toxic elements in J. curcas seeds, oil and biodiesel, especially Na, K, Ca, Mg, P and S in biodiesel which are mandatory analyzed by Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuel National Agency (ANP).

Increasingly, there is a realization that utilization of the fossilized carbon sources has adverse environmental consequences in the form of increasing concentration of greenhouse gases. We are also becoming aware of the limited nature of these resources. As a result, considerable efforts are being made to produce chemicals and fuels from renewable resources such as forest products, agricultural residues and plant products. All of these systems capture solar energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide as a part of the natural carbon cycle. Serious research efforts are also underway, targeting cultivation of photosynthetic autotrophic microbes for the production of biomass and lipids. In this category, algae appears to offer the most potential for capturing solar energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide and delivering sufficient quantities of biomass/lipids that can offset the fossilized carbon utilization in a meaningful manner without impacting food output adversely. However, several advances, both technologically as well as politically, are needed before we can realize its full potential. It is also clear that a biorefinery approach must be undertaken in order to harvest renewable energy and chemicals from algae economically. This edited, multi-authored volume on Algal Biorefineries will document new advances involving algae-based technology. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,,,Springer Netherlands,,9789400774940; 9400774931; 9789400774933,,,English,Algal Biorefineries,Book,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933046493

Methods: We compared cancer incidence in children in Pennsylvania counties before and after HF drilling began, using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The total number of cancers observed was close to expected both before drilling began (SIR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.99) and after drilling (SIR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.07) for counties with oil and natural gas wells. Analyses for childhood leukemia were also unremarkable (SIR for leukemia before drilling = 0.97 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.06]; SIR for leukemia after drilling = 1.01 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.11]). A slightly elevated SIR was found for central nervous system tumors after drilling (SIR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.25). This was because of a slight excess in those counties with the fewest number of wells. Conclusions: This study offers comfort concerning health effects of HF on childhood cancers.

Our goal was to document the self-reported health impacts and mental and physical health stressors perceived to result from Marcellus Shale development. Methods: Two sets of interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of community members living proximal to Marcellus Shale development, session 1 March-September 2010 (n=33) and session 2 January-April 2012 (n=20). Symptoms of health impacts and sources of psychological stress were coded. Symptom and stressor counts were quantified for each interview. The counts for each participant were compared longitudinally. Results: Participants attributed 59 unique health impacts and 13 stressors to Marcellus Shale development. Stress was the most frequently-reported symptom. Over time, perceived health impacts increased (P=0.042), while stressors remained constant (P=0.855). Discussion: Exposure-based epidemiological studies are needed to address identified health impacts and those that may develop as unconventional natural gas extraction continues. Many of the stressors can be addressed immediately. © W. S.

HVHF has been promoted as a way to decrease dependence on foreign energy sources, replace dirtier energy sources like coal, and generate economic development. At the same time, activities related to expanded HVHF pose potential risks including ground-and surface water contamination, climate change, air pollution, and effects on worker health. HVHF has been largely approached as an issue of energy economics and environmental regulation, but it also has significant implications for public health. We argue that public health provides an important perspective on policy-making in this arena. The American Public Health Association (APHA) recently adopted a policy position for involvement of public health professionals in this issue. Building on that foundation, this commentary lays out a set of five perspectives that guide how public health can contribute to this conversation. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.",Environmental health; Hydrofracking; Public health,natural gas; air pollution; climate change; economics; mining; prevention and control; procedures; public health; quality of life; risk management; United States; water pollution; Air Pollution; Climate Change; Extraction and Processing Industry; Natural Gas; Public Health; Quality of Life; Risk Management; United States; Water Pollution,"Korfmacher, K.S.601 Elmwood Avenue, Box EHSC, United States; эл. почта: katrina_korfmacher@urmc.rochester.edu",,SAGE Publications Ltd,10482911,,,23552646.0,English,New Solut.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891471354

With natural gas exploration and production active in the Project Rulison area, this human health risk assessment was performed in order to add a human health perspective for site stewardship. Tritium (H) is the radionuclide of concern with respect to potential induced migration from the test cavity leading to subsequent exposure during gas-flaring activities. This analysis assumes gas flaring would occur for up to 30 d and produce atmospheric H activity concentrations either as low as 2.2 × 10-6 Bq m-3 (6 × 10-5 pCi m-3) from the minimum detectable activity concentration in produced water or as high as 20.7 Bq m-3 (560 pCi m-3), which equals the highest atmospheric measurement reported during gas-flaring operations conducted at the time of Project Rulison. The lifetime morbidity (fatal and nonfatal) cancer risks calculated for adults (residents and workers) and children (residents) from inhalation and dermal exposures to such activity concentrations are all below 1 × 10-6 and considered de minimis. The implications for monitoring production water for conforming health-protective, risk-based action levels also are examined.

The purpose of the refinery was to reduce the SO2 emission, but using natural gas as fuel could increase the concentrations of O3 precursors in the atmosphere. Thus a biomonitoring was performed with a native species sensitive to O3. The plants were exposed in five areas (CM1, CM5, CEPEMA, Centro, and RP) at different distances to the refinery, both before and after the fuel exchange. We performed six exposures under environmental conditions, with length of ca. 90 days each. With the utilization of natural gas, the saplings presented reductions in carbon assimilation rate under saturating light conditions (Asat, μmolCO2m-2s-1) and the stomatal conductance (gs, molH2Om-2s-1), and increase in height, number of leaves, and dry mass of leaves and shoots. There were also reductions in root dry mass and in the root/shoot ratio. The saplings also presented O3-induced leaf injuries. The responses of P. guajava 'Paluma' were altered after the fuel exchange as a result of a new combination of pollutants in the atmosphere. The fuel exchange has not resulted in environmental benefit to the surrounding forest; it has only altered the contamination profile of the region. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Air pollution; Biomonitoring; Gas exchange; Leaf injury; Psidium guajava 'Paluma',fuel; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; petroleum; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; bioindicator; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); crude oil; environmental conditions; fruit; gas exchange; natural gas; sulfur dioxide; tree; air pollution indicator; air quality standard; article; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; Brazil; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental plant disease; evapotranspiration; geographic distribution; growth rate; guava; humidity; leaf gas exchange; leaf structure; nonhuman; oil industry; particulate matter; plant leaf; plant root; precipitation; sensitivity analysis; shoot; temperature sensitivity; Air Pollutants; Brazil; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Psidium; Brazil; Cubatao; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Psidium; Psidium guajava,"Silva, S.F.R.Coghi, n 75, Jardim Belvedere, Cep. 13.601-030 Araras/SP, Brazil; эл. почта: sifsil@yahoo.com.br",,,01476513,,EESAD,23391563.0,English,Ecotoxicol.

Residential poisonings caused by faulty furnaces are the most common type of CO exposure. However, these poisonings are largely preventable with annual furnace inspections and CO alarm installation. Objective This study aimed to identify the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs that might lead consumers to adopt these protective behaviours. Methods In August 2009, four focus groups (n=29) were conducted with homeowners in Chicago, Illinois, USA, to identify the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs that lead consumers to adopt risk and protective behaviours. Discussions were transcribed and the findings were analysed using an ordered meta-matrix. Results Focus group participants were aware of CO poisoning and supported the idea of regular furnace inspections. However, few participants consistently scheduled professional inspections for fear of costly repairs and unscrupulous contractors. Participants often owned CO alarms, but many did not locate them properly, nor maintain them. Some participants confused CO and natural gas and were unsure how to react if a CO alarm sounds. Participants stated that incentives, such as discounts and inspector selection tips, would make them more likely to schedule furnace inspections. Participants also identified trustworthy sources for CO education, including realtors, fire departments, home insurance agents and local media outlets. Conclusions Participants' residential CO risk behaviours are not random but driven by underlying knowledge, attitudes and beliefs. Correcting misperceptions, providing incentives and partnering with trustworthy sources might encourage greater consumer adoption of protective behaviours.",,"adult; aged; article; attitude to health; carbon monoxide intoxication; female; health behavior; human; information processing; male; middle aged; protective equipment; risk factor; United States; utilization review; Adult; Aged; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Female; Focus Groups; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Protective Devices; Risk Factors; United States","Rupert, D.

For this reason, the refinery replaced a system in which energy was produced from crude oil combustion in boilers with a system of energy and vapor co-generation in a thermoelectric power plant fueled by natural gas. The aim of this study was to investigate the responses of Tibouchina pulchra to the fuel switching. Saplings planted in pots were distributed throughout monitoring sites around the polluting source (sites I, II, III and IV) and in a site (V) far from emissions. Changes on the plants responses occur along the three fuel switching phases. During the last phase, increased carbon assimilation (Asat) and decreased stomatal conductance (gs) were observed in plants growing in sites II and III; as a consequence, intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) increased. However, the increase in Asat did not promote growth increase suggesting that changes at the refinery did not result in better air quality, but only in a change in the main contaminants. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Air pollution; Biomonitoring; Gas exchange; Growth; Refinery; Tibouchina pulchra,"carbon; natural gas; petroleum; atmospheric pollution; biomonitoring; combustion; crude oil; gas exchange; growth response; natural gas; physiological response; pollutant source; stomatal conductance; sulfur dioxide; tree; water use efficiency; air pollution; air quality; article; carbon fixation; combustion; controlled study; environmental monitoring; leaf gas exchange; nonhuman; oil industry; plant growth; plant stress; plant water use; sapling; stomatal conductance; tibouchina pulchra; tree; Air Pollutants; Brazil; Carbon; Gas, Natural; Melastomataceae; Petroleum; Plant Stomata; Power Plants; Sulfur Dioxide; Brazil; Cubatao; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Tibouchina pulchra","Silva, D.T.; Instituto de Botânica, Caixa Postal 68041, 04045-972 São Paulo, SP, Brazil; эл. почта: dayateixsil@gmail.com",,,01476513,,EESAD,23352657.0,English,Ecotoxicol.

While dependability was initially dominant, limitations in its ability to account for human variability have gradually become apparent. The use of the human and organisational factors paradigm emerged in an attempt to overcome these limitations, and learning from operational experience has evolved out of this. This evolution led to a shift of interest towards the influence of the work environment on human performance. The CREAM method, structured by the Common Performance Conditions (CPCs), is a major example of this trend. This paper discusses the design and deployment of an accident analysis grid developed in 2008 by a major French gas distribution company.

Salmon were fed a diet based on fish meal (FM) or seven diets with 200 g/kg solvent-extracted soyabean meal (SBM) to induce enteritis in combination with increasing levels of BM from 0 to 300 g/kg. Salmon fed a SBM-containing diet without BM developed typical SBM-induced enteritis. The enteritis gradually disappeared with increasing inclusion of BM. By morphometry, no significant (P&gt;0·05) differences in the size of stretches stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen were found with 150 g/kg BM compared with the FM diet. Increasing BM inclusion caused a gradual decline in the number of cluster of differentiation 8 α positive (CD8α+) intraepithelial lymphocytes, and fish fed BM at 200 g/kg or higher revealed no significant difference from the FM diet. Histological sections stained with antibody for MHC class II (MHC II) showed that fish with intestinal inflammation had more MHC II-reactive cells in the lamina propria and submucosa, but less in the epithelium and brush border, compared with fish without inflammation. There were no significant (P&gt;0·05) differences in growth among the diets, but the highest levels of BM slightly reduced protein digestibility and increased the weight of the distal intestine. In conclusion, the prevention of SBM-induced enteritis by BM is dose dependent and related to intestinal levels of MHC II-and CD8α-reactive cells. © 2012 The Authors.",Atlantic salmon; Bacterial meal; Enteritis; Soyabean meal,"cycline; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; animal experiment; animal food; animal tissue; article; Atlantic salmon; bacterium; CD8alpha+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; enteritis; histopathology; intestine brush border; intestine epithelium; lamina propria; lymphocyte count; meal; morphometrics; nonhuman; organ weight; soybean; submucosa; T lymphocyte; Animals; Antigens, CD8; Bacteria; Enteritis; Epithelium; Fish Diseases; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II; Intestines; Lymphocytes; Organ Size; Salmo salar; Soybeans","Romarheim, O.H.; Department of Animal and Aquacultural Sciences, PO Box 5003, NO-1432 Ås, Norway; эл. почта: odd-helge.romarheim@umb.no",,,00071145,,BJNUA,22813713.0,English,Br.

Relying entirely on public and peer-reviewed data sources, we examine historical trends in the CI of oil sands extraction, upgrading, and refining. Monthly data were collected and interpolated from 1970 to 2010 (inclusive) for each oil sands project. Results show a reduction in oil sands CI over time, with industry-average full-fuel cycle (well-to-wheels, WTW) CI declining from 165 gCO 2e MJ -1 higher heating value (HHV) of reformulated gasoline (RFG) to 105 (-12, +9) gCO 2e MJ-1 HHV RFG. 2010 averages by production pathways are 102 gCO 2e MJ-1 for Mining and 111 gCO 2e MJ-1 for in situ. The CI of mining-based projects has declined due to upgrader efficiency improvements and a shift away from coke to natural gas as a process fuel. In situ projects have benefitted from substantial reductions in fugitive emissions from bitumen batteries. Both mining and in situ projects have benefitted from improved refining efficiencies. However, despite these improvements, the CI of oil sands production (on a pathway-average basis) ranges from 12 to 24% higher than CI values from conventional oil production. Due to growing output, total emissions from the oil sands continue to increase despite improved efficiency: total upstream emissions were roughly 65 MtCO 2e in 2010, or 9% of Canada's emissions. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Alberta oil sands; climate change; LCA; life-cycle assessment; transportation fuels; unconventional oil,Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Oil sands; Petroleum transportation; Refining; Alberta oil sands; LCA; Life-cycle assessments; Transportation fuels; Unconventional oil; Oil sand refining; anthropogenic effect; crude oil; greenhouse gas; historical perspective; oil production; oil sand; project design,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891938625

Drought raised electricity demands/generation by 6%, increasing water demands/consumption for electricity by 9%. Reductions in monitored reservoir storage <50% of capacity in 2011 would suggest drought vulnerability, but data show that the power plants were flexible enough at the plant level to adapt by switching to less water-intensive technologies.

We have addressed such issues by modeling thermoelectric generation in the Northeastern United States that is reliant on cooling under five sensitivity tests to evaluate losses/gains in power production, thermal pollution and suitable aquatic habitat, comparing the contemporary baseline (2000-2010) with potential future states. Integral to the analysis, we developed a methodology to quantify river water availability for cooling, which we define as an ecosystem service. Projected climate conditions reduce river water available for efficient power plant operations and the river's capacity to absorb waste heat, causing a loss of regional thermoelectric generation (RTG) (2.5%) in some summers that, compared to the contemporary baseline, is equal to the summertime electricity consumption of 1.3 million Northeastern US homes. Vulnerabilities to warm temperatures and thermal pollution can be alleviated through the use of more efficient natural gas (NG) power plants that have a reduced reliance on cooling water. Conversion of once-through (OT) to cooling tower (CT) systems and the Clean Water Act (CWA) temperature limit regulation, both of which reduce efficiencies at the single plant level, show potential to yield beneficial increases in RTG. This is achieved by obviating the need for large volumes of river water, thereby reducing plant-to-plant interferences through lowering the impact of upstream thermal pollution and preserving a minimum standard of cooling water. The results and methodology framework presented here, which can be extrapolated to other regional assessments with contrasting climates and thermoelectric profiles, can identify opportunities and support decision-making to achieve more efficient energy systems and riverine ecosystem protection. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",climate change; cooling; ecosystem service; electricity generation; environmental regulation; power plant; regional planning; water resources,Climate change; Cooling; Cooling systems; Cooling water; Ecosystems; Environmental regulations; Facings; Hydrogeology; Power plants; Regional planning; Rivers; Thermal pollution; Waste heat; Water resources; Ecosystem services; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Electricity-consumption; Riverine ecosystems; Sensitivity tests; Temperature limits; Thermoelectric generation; Water pollution; climate conditions; cooling; decision making; ecosystem service; electricity generation; habitat type; power plant; river; river pollution; river water; temperature effect; thermal pollution; vulnerability; water resource; United States,,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880871754

To achieve such balance, decisions involving the so-called water-energy nexus must necessarily embrace a regional multi-power plant perspective. We present here the Thermoelectric Power & Thermal Pollution Model (TP2M), a simulation model that simultaneously quantifies thermal pollution of rivers and estimates efficiency losses in electricity generation as a result of fluctuating intake temperatures and river flows typically encountered across the temperate zone. We demonstrate the model's theoretical framework by carrying out sensitivity tests based on energy, physical and environmental settings. We simulate a series of five thermoelectric plants aligned along a hypothetical river, where we find that warm ambient temperatures, acting both as a physical constraint and as a trigger for regulatory limits on plant operations directly reduce electricity generation. As expected, environmental regulation aimed at reducing thermal loads at a single plant reduces power production at that plant, but ironically can improve the net electricity output from multiple plants when they are optimally co-managed. On the technology management side, high efficiency can be achieved through the use of natural gas combined cycle plants, which can raise the overall efficiency of the aging population of plants, including that of coal. Tradeoff analysis clearly shows the benefit of attaining such high efficiencies, in terms of both limiting thermal loads that preserve ecosystem services and increasing electricity production that benefits economic development. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"coal; natural gas; aging; conceptual framework; controlled study; cooling technology; cost benefit analysis; decision making; economic development; electric power plant; electricity; energy yield; environmental protection; hydropower; priority journal; review; river ecosystem; riverine ecosystem protection; simulation; strategic planning; technology; temperature; thermal pollution; thermoelectric power; tradeoffs; water flow; analysis; chemistry; computer simulation; economics; ecosystem; pollution; river; theoretical model; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollution; Models, Theoretical; Power Plants; Rivers; Temperature","Miara, A.; CUNY Environmental Crossroads Initiative, City College of New York, 160 Convent Avenue, New York NY 10031, United States; эл. почта: amiara00@ccny.cuny.edu",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,23636670.0,English,Environ.

The high pressure fluid causes the rock to fracture. The new fractures increase the surface area of the shale and better interconnect previously existing fractures, allowing more natural gas and/or oil to be pumped from the formation. Modern hydraulic fracturing, referred to as ""fracking,"" is an evolving technology that largely began after 2000 and has significantly increased natural gas production in the United States in the past five years with corresponding decreases in natural gas prices. The revolution in hydraulic fracturing has been made possible by technological advancements in directional drilling. In the past, wells were drilled vertically and sometimes passed only briefly into the producing formation. Shale is a sedimentary rock that is initially formed underwater as a horizontal layer containing compacted mud that is cemented into rock. Intact shale has a low permeability, making fluid movement slow except along natural or artificial fractures in the rock. In the case of the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, the shale is approximately 100 to 250 feet thick. The Barnett Shale in Central Texas is between 100 and 500 ft, averaging about 300 ft; Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas is very variable with an average of about 250 ft; Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas is between 60-575 ft, average of about 200 ft; Haynesville Shale in Northwest Louisiana averages about 250 ft. Tectonic activity may later deform the initially horizontal layer into different angles and shapes, but the fundamental problem remains of how to most efficiently extract fluids from relatively thin and deep rock layers that have low permeability. Directional drilling allows a well to be oriented in a vertical direction until the shale layer is approached and then turned in to the approximately horizontal direction needed to follow along the shale layer (Figure 1). The wells can be turned in any compass direction, allowing multiple wells from a single pad to reach areas of several square miles in the producing shale location, thus significantly reducing their surface footprint and disturbance when compared to vertical drilling. Wells have been drilled more than a mile deep and a mile in horizontal reach. Furthermore, the Marcellus Shale is underlain by the thicker Utica Shale, making it likely that the same pads may years later be used to drill wells into the Utica Shale as well when gas prices rise sufficiently to make deeper drilling cost effective. Information on the extents of the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations is available in USGS reports listed in their Energy Resources Program (USGS, 2013) and at the website geology.com (Geology.com, 2013). The second key to increased access to energy resources is hydraulic fracturing. Shales naturally have a low permeability, meaning removal of resources is slow and inefficient. High pressure fluids containing proppants (e.g., sand), biocides, friction reducers, corrosion inhibitors, iron control, scale inhibitors, surfactants, and acids are injected into the wells to cause fracturing of the shale. The proppants move into the newly created fractures and expanded natural fractures and then prop the fractures open when the fluids are removed. The injected fluid is primarily (~99.5%) sand and water and the additive mixtures change by location, company, and as the technology evolves. Much of the injected water is later extracted from the well during production, along with formation waters. The exact spacing of pads, number of wells per pad, orientation of wells drilled from each pad, and well distance in the horizontal and vertical directions, depends upon surface access, drilling rights, formation properties, and economics. Leasing is an issue. Leases typically expire after a fixed period of time (typically about 5 years) if there is no drilling activity. Companies can drill but choose not to hydraulically fracture or produce from the well prior to lease expiration in order to lock up the resources until the economics of production improve. Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized the energy field, causing the United States to switch from a need to import natural gas to a situation where export of natural gas is being considered. Energy independence, low energy costs, and economic development are clear positives that have been advanced by the revolution in hydraulic fracturing. This paper will summarize some of the environmental impacts associated with fracking. The order of subjects is approximately from the most obvious and certain to more subtle impacts.",Drilling; Environmental impact; Fracking; Hydraulic fracturing; Land use and disturbance; Risk; Water and groundwater contamination,,,,College Publishing,15526100,,,,English,J.

Fifty-five patients who had been referred to the hospital between January 2008 and December 2010 and who met the inclusion criteria were accepted to the study. Data on the place they live, biomass exposure duration, lung function parameters, and arterial blood gases were recorded. Statistically significant differences in FEV(1)%, FEV1 (L) and, FEV(1)/FVC existed between the subgroups of duration of biomass exposure (P = .001). FEV(1)% and FEV(1)/FVC were highest in the < 30 hour-years exposure group. In the presence of animal dung use, the odds ratio and 95% CI for the risk of FEV(1)/FVC < 70% was 3.5 (0.88-10.29). Subjects who used animal dung and wood for cooking and heating had severe and very severe FEV(1) stages. Biomass exposure can have effects on lung function test parameters. Animal dung use is primarily related to risk of deterioration of FEV(1)/FVC, when compared to other biomass fuels. Protective health measures should be taken by assessing the risks in areas where biomass exposure is intense, improving poor design of the stoves and ventilation, and switching to better clean energy sources such as natural gas and solar energy.",,"smoke; aged; animal; biomass; blood gas analysis; developing country; environmental exposure; female; human; indoor air pollution; Lung Diseases; lung function test; middle aged; pathophysiology; retrospective study; smoke; smoking; Turkey; Aged; Air Pollution, Indoor; Animals; Biomass; Blood Gas Analysis; Developing Countries; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Lung Diseases; Middle Aged; Respiratory Function Tests; Retrospective Studies; Smoke; Smoking; Turkey","Köksal, H.",,,19433654,,,23443283.0,English,Respir Care,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876209813

Region-wide estimated damages ranged from $7.2 to $32 million dollars for 2011. The emissions from Pennsylvania shale gas extraction represented only a few per cent of total statewide emissions, and the resulting statewide damages were less than those estimated for each of the state's largest coal-based power plants. On the other hand, in counties where activities are concentrated, NOx emissions from all shale gas activities were 20-40 times higher than allowable for a single minor source, despite the fact that individual new gas industry facilities generally fall below the major source threshold for NOx. Most emissions are related to ongoing activities, i.e., gas production and compression, which can be expected to persist beyond initial development and which are largely unrelated to the unconventional nature of the resource. Regulatory agencies and the shale gas industry, in developing regulations and best practices, should consider air emissions from these long-term activities, especially if development occurs in more populated areas of the state where per-ton emissions damages are significantly higher. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",air quality; criteria pollutants; externalities; Marcellus Shale; natural gas,Air quality; Economics; Extraction; Gas industry; Natural gas; Shale; Air pollutant emission; Coal based power plants; criteria pollutants; externalities; Initial development; Marcellus shales; Natural gas extraction; Regulatory agencies; Gas emissions; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission; estimation method; human activity; natural gas; policy making; pollutant; power plant; shale; Pennsylvania; United States,"Litovitz, A.; RAND Corporation, 1776 Main Street, Santa Monica, CA 90407, United States",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876195914

A particular benefit is that it can alleviate competition for land conventionally used for food and feed production. In this research, we investigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production of ethanol, biomethane, limonene and digestate from citrus waste, a byproduct of the citrus processing industry. The study represents the first life cycle-based evaluations of citrus waste biorefineries. Two biorefinery configurations are studied - a large biorefinery that converts citrus waste into ethanol, biomethane, limonene and digestate, and a small biorefinery that converts citrus waste into biomethane, limonene and digestate. Ethanol is assumed to be used as E85, displacing gasoline as a light-duty vehicle fuel; biomethane displaces natural gas for electricity generation, limonene displaces acetone in solvents, and digestate from the anaerobic digestion process displaces synthetic fertilizer. System expansion and two allocation methods (energy, market value) are considered to determine emissions of co-products. Considerable GHG reductions would be achieved by producing and utilizing the citrus waste-based products in place of the petroleum-based or other non-renewable products. For the large biorefinery, ethanol used as E85 in light-duty vehicles results in a 134% reduction in GHG emissions compared to gasoline-fueled vehicles when applying a system expansion approach. For the small biorefinery, when electricity is generated from biomethane rather than natural gas, GHG emissions are reduced by 77% when applying system expansion. The life cycle GHG emissions vary substantially depending upon biomethane leakage rate, feedstock GHG emissions and the method to determine emissions assigned to co-products. Among the process design parameters, the biomethane leakage rate is critical, and the ethanol produced in the large biorefinery would not meet EISA's requirements for cellulosic biofuel if the leakage rate is higher than 9.7%. For the small biorefinery, there are no GHG emission benefits in the production of biomethane if the leakage rate is higher than 11.5%. Compared to system expansion, the use of energy and market value allocation methods generally results in higher estimates of GHG emissions for the primary biorefinery products (i.e., smaller reductions in emissions compared to reference systems). © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",biofuel; citrus waste; life cycle assessment; limonene,Acetone; Anaerobic digestion; Bioconversion; Biofuels; Commerce; Ethanol; Finance; Gasoline; Life cycle; Monoterpenes; Natural gas; Organic solvents; Refining; Anaerobic digestion process; Citrus wastes; Electricity generation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle GHG emissions; limonene; Process design parameters; Synthetic fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; alternative energy; biofuel; cellulose; electricity generation; ethanol; food processing; food production; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; methane; natural gas; refuse; Citrus,"Pourbafrani, M.; Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, 200 College Street, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876191146

Although biomass production for liquid fuel has received more attention, here we present a case study of biomass production for renewable heat and power in the state of Wisconsin (US), where heating constitutes at least 30% of total energy demand. Using three bioenergy systems (50 kW, 8.8 MW and 50 MW) and Wisconsin farm-level data, we determined the net farm income effect of producing switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) as a feedstock, either for on-farm use (50 kW system) or for sale to an off-farm energy system operator (8.8 and 50 MW systems). In southern counties, where switchgrass yields approach 10 Mg ha-1 yr-1, the main determinants of economic feasibility were the available land area per farm, the ability to utilize bioheat, and opportunity cost assumptions. Switchgrass yield temporal variability was less important. For the state median farm size and switchgrass yield, at least 25% (50 kW system) or 50% (8.8 MW system) bioheat utilization was required to economically offset propane or natural gas heat, respectively, and purchased electricity. Offsetting electricity only (50 MW system) did not generate enough revenue to meet switchgrass production expenses. Although the opportunity cost of small-scale (50 kW) on-farm bioenergy generation was higher, it also held greater opportunity for increasing farm net income, especially by replacing propane-based heat. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",bioenergy; bioheat; biomass; land use,Biomass; Costs; Economic analysis; Energy management; Land use; Propane; Bio-energy; Bio-energy systems; Bio-heat; Biomass productions; Economic feasibilities; Opportunity costs; Production expense; Temporal variability; Plants (botany); bioenergy; biomass power; electricity generation; energy crop; energy resource; farm; grass; land use change; renewable resource; United States; Wisconsin; Panicum virgatum,"Myhre, M.; Nelson Institute Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE), University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1710 University Avenue, Madison, WI 53726, United States",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876176477

The market uncertainty in fossil fuel prices has received relatively less attention in the global land use literature. Petroleum and natural gas prices affect both the competitiveness of biofuels and the cost of nitrogen fertilizers. High prices put significant pressure on global land supply and greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial systems, while low prices can moderate demands for cropland. The goal of this letter is to assess and compare the effects of these core uncertainties on the optimal profile for global land use and land-based GHG emissions over the coming century. The model that we develop integrates distinct strands of agronomic, biophysical and economic literature into a single, intertemporally consistent, analytical framework, at global scale. Our analysis accounts for the value of land-based services in the production of food, first- and second-generation biofuels, timber, forest carbon and biodiversity.

Radon is the largest source of natural radiation exposure; it represents almost 50% of the radiation that people are exposed to in a lifetime. Thermal spas are multifaceted projects that have been increasing in the last few years. However, the presence of radon in thermal and mineral waters enhance the risk of professionals being exposed to an additional level of radiation as well as the visitors and patients. Therefore, a growing interest and mostly a concern in protecting people exposed to radiation from radon and short-lived daughters have been drawn much of public attention.

Design/methodology/approach: Indoor air quality was monitored during cooking hours in 55 rural households to estimate the emissions of PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, VOCs and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). While, PM10 and PM2.5 were monitored using personal dust samplers on quartz filter paper, CO and VOCs were monitored using on line monitors. The PM10 and PM2.5 mass collected on filter papers was processed to analyse the presence of PAHs using GC. Findings: Results revealed that cow dung is the most polluting fuel with maximum emissions of PM10, PM 2.5, VOCs, CO, NO2 and Benzene followed by wood and kerosene. Interestingly kerosene combustion emits the highest amount of PAHs. Emissions for all the fuels show the presence of carcinogenic PAHs which could be a serious health concern. The composition of LPG/PNG leads to reductions of pollutants because of better combustion process. LPG which is largely propane and butane, and PNG which is 90 per cent methane prove to be healthier fuels. Based on the results, the authors suggest that technological intervention is required to replace the traditional stoves with improved fuel efficient stoves. Practical implications: The prevailing weather condition and design of the kitchen in these rural houses severely affect the concentration of pollutants in the kitchen as winter season combined with inadequate ventilation leads to reduced dispersion and accumulation of air pollutants in small kitchens. Originality/value: The present study provides a detailed analysis of impact of widely-used cooking practices in India. Even today, countries such as India rely on biomass for cooking practices exposing the cooks to high level of carcinogenic pollutants. Further, women and girls are the most threatened group as they are the primary cooks in these rural Indian settings. Based on the results, the authors suggest that technological as well as policy intervention is required to replace the traditional stoves with improved fuel efficient stoves. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Air pollutants; Cooking; Fuel consumption; India; Indoor air quality; Particulate air pollutants; PM10; PM2.5; Polyaromatic hydrocarbons; Rural areas; Volatile organics,,"Gautam, S.

This study describes the characteristics of motor vehicle-related fatalities in the oil and gas extraction industry using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. It compares the risk of dying in a motor vehicle crash in this industry to other major industries and among different types and sizes of oil and gas extraction companies. There were 202 oil and gas extraction workers who died in a work-related motor vehicle crash from 2003 to 2009. The motor vehicle fatality rate for workers in this industry was 8.5 times that of all private wage and salary workers (7.6 vs. 0.9, p <.0001). Workers from small oil and gas establishments (<20 workers) and workers from well-servicing companies were at greatest risk of dying in a motor vehicle crash. Pick-up trucks were the most frequent type of vehicle occupied by the fatally injured worker (n = 104, 51.5%). Safety belt non-use was identified in 38.1% (n = 77) of the cases. Increased focus on motor vehicle safety in this industry is needed, in particular among small establishments. Extraction workers who drive light duty vehicles need to be a specific focus. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Unstable production, often called heading, may lead to periods of reduced or even no liquid production followed by large peaks of liquid and gas. This result in average oil production less than expected, and oil and gas production less than the systems design capacity to allow for the production peaks without causing shutdowns. To solve the problem the amount of lift gas is normally increased beyond the most optimum rate. When the lift gas supply is limited, other gas lifted wells must then be shut in. This paper describes field proven sequence based automation for oil production, plus a new model-based automatic controller. Both technologies solve the problem of unstable production from gas lifted wells through manipulation of the production and/or the gas-injection chokes. The sequence-based automation and the model-based controller stabilize the production at operating points that would be unstable under standard operation. Field measurements such as wellhead pressure, annulus pressure etc. are inputs to the controllers (or are used by the controller). Examples are given of the modelbased controller working together with realistic transient flow models of gas lift wells. Testing of the model-based controller on real unstable wells is planned. © 2012 IEEE.",casing heading; density wave; feedback control; gas-lift,Automatic controllers; casing heading; Density waves; Model-based controller; Oil and gas production; Oil production wells; Steady-state flow analysis; Transient flow models; Adaptive control systems; Biomedical engineering; Feedback control; Gas lifts; Gases; Information science; Liquids; Natural gas wells; Oil wells; Well testing; Injection (oil wells),"Department of Geology, , Xi'an, China",,,,9781467311816,,,English,"Int.

It delivers more than a quarter of total energy used in Croatia to its consumers. Over the years, adapting technology to increasingly demanding and rigorous standards in environmental protection has become paramount. Yet, despite all the industry has undertaken to address the risk of harmful substances entering the food chain, a multidisciplinary research team of independent scientists monitors the content of specific substances in all components of the ecosystem. This paper presents measurements of total sulphur contents in soil surface [(0 to 3) cm] and subsurface [(3 to 8) cm] layers (study period: autumn 2006 - spring 2010) and in plants (study period: spring 2000 - spring 2010), and the concentration of gaseous sulphur compounds in the air. Concentrations of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and mercaptans (RSH) were measured from the summer of 2002 until the autumn of 2010, while concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO2) were measured from the spring of 2008 until the autumn of 2010. The paper also shows total annual atmospheric sulphur (S-SO4) deposition at Bilogora measuring station (study period: 2001 - 2010). Average monthly concentrations of H2S in air varied between 0.2 μg m-3 and 2.0 μg m-3, RSH between 0.1 μg m-3 and 24.5 μg m-3, and SO2 between 0.4 μg m-3 and 2.8 μg m-3 depending on the location and the season of sampling. Mean values of total sulphur in soil and in Plantago lanceolata plant ranged between 610 mg kg-1 and 1,599 mg kg -1 and between 3,614 mg kg-1 and 4,342 mg kg-1, respectively, depending on the soil type, location, and sampling depth. Average values of total sulphur mass ratio for all examined single soil samples (n=80) were 1,080 mg kg-1 for both studied layers, and 4,108 mg kg -1 for all analysed plant samples (n=85).

Majority of intoxication reports of hydrocarbons are due to inhalation or ingestion, but there is few reports about intravenous injection of gasoline. We report a 58 year-old man who injected gasoline intravenously for suicide. He developed soft tissue necrosis of forearm and bilateral pulmonary infiltration. He underwent fasciotomy and extensive debridement of necrotic tissues, at the operation room. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated because of acute lung injury. He developed acute kidney injury after 2 days. These symptoms seem to be due to extravasation of gasoline from vessels which lead to inflammation, cell damage and organ failure. The patient developed multi organ failure which unfortunately did not respond to our treatment and he died at day 21. Management of gasoline intoxication depends on the rout of exposure. Like other types of toxications, intravenous toxication has pulmonary involvement, however in this case we had multiple organ involvement.

Indoor air pollution as a result of using natural gas for cooking and heating is a common health threat, particularly for women and young children. Therefore, quantification of the type and emission levels of these pollutants is necessary in order to mitigate and monitor the emissions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) can be used to model airflow and dispersion within buildings of complex geometry and layout. In the present paper, a CFD analysis is performed to determine the concentration of indoor air quality for a typical one-floor building in order to determine the optimal locations of monitoring sensors. According to this study, placing the monitoring sensors based on the maximum concentrations of the individual contaminant does not entirely overcome the problems, as the concentrations of different hazardous pollutants cannot be added. Moreover, high concentration with low duration of exposure is not a good candidate for placing the monitoring system. A risk-based methodology is proposed to determine the optimal location for the monitoring systems. Different risk management strategies are also considered as a part of the methodology to reduce the exposure risk of indoor contaminants. © The Author(s), 2011.",CFD; indoor air quality; monitoring systems; risk-based decision,air quality; article; computational fluid dynamics; cooking; exposure; heating; human; indoor air pollution; methodology; monitoring; priority journal; risk factor; risk management; sensor,"Abbassi, R.; Process Engineering, , St Johns, NL A1B 3X5, Canada; эл. почта: rabbassi@mun.ca",,,1420326X,,IBENF,,English,Indoor Built Environ.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867776778

These techniques carry potential environmental risk due to their high water use and substantial risk for water pollution. Using probability bounds analysis, we assessed the likelihood of water contamination from natural gas extraction in the Marcellus Shale. Probability bounds analysis is well suited when data are sparse and parameters highly uncertain. The study model identified five pathways of water contamination: transportation spills, well casing leaks, leaks through fractured rock, drilling site discharge, and wastewater disposal. Probability boxes were generated for each pathway. The potential contamination risk and epistemic uncertainty associated with hydraulic fracturing wastewater disposal was several orders of magnitude larger than the other pathways. Even in a best-case scenario, it was very likely that an individual well would release at least 200 m3 of contaminated fluids. Because the total number of wells in the Marcellus Shale region could range into the tens of thousands, this substantial potential risk suggested that additional steps be taken to reduce the potential for contaminated fluid leaks. To reduce the considerable epistemic uncertainty, more data should be collected on the ability of industrial and municipal wastewater treatment facilities to remove contaminants from used hydraulic fracturing fluid. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.",Marcellus; Probability bounds analysis; Water,"Contamination risks; Environmental risks; Epistemic uncertainties; Fractured rock; High water; Marcellus; Municipal wastewater treatment facility; Natural gas extraction; Orders of magnitude; Potential risks; Probability bound; Probability box; Shale gas; Water contamination; Contamination; Fracturing fluids; Hydraulic fracturing; Natural gas; Natural gas well drilling; Rock drilling; Shale; Uncertainty analysis; Wastewater disposal; Water; Water supply; Water pollution; natural gas; capping; data acquisition; discharge; environmental risk; extraction method; fractured medium; gas field; horizontal drilling; hydraulic fracture; leakage; natural gas; pollutant removal; pollutant transport; probability; risk assessment; shale; waste disposal; waste facility; wastewater; water pollution; water use; article; environment; environmental monitoring; methodology; policy; probability; public health; risk; risk assessment; sewage; theoretical model; waste water; water management; water pollutant; water pollution; water supply; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Gas, Natural; Models, Theoretical; Probability; Public Health; Public Policy; Risk; Risk Assessment; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution; Water Purification; Water Supply; North America","Rozell, D.J.; Department of Technology and Society, 347A Harriman Hall, Stony Brook, NY 11794-3760, United States; эл. почта: drozell@ic.sunysb.edu",,,02724332,,RIAND,22211399.0,English,Risk Anal.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865105017

Hydraulic fracturing and the ongoing revolution in natural gas exploration make an excellent case study of the difficulties that inevitably arise, are difficult to resolve, and that expand threats to public health and safety when policy makers do not prioritize risk assessment and risk management until the negative impacts or potential harms of previous decisions are felt. The analysis begins with a description of the hydraulic fracturing revolution and a discussion of the potential risks associated with it. This will include some of the preliminary scientific work on the subject. The analysis will highlight concerns that timely assessment and management of these risks is often frustrated by the policy process itself.

Results were analyzed to quantify the impact of various device- and installation-dependent parameters on CE. Measured maximum airflows were 70% or lower than values noted on product literature for 10 of the devices. Above-the-cooktop devices with flat-bottom surfaces (no capture hood) - including exhaust fan/microwave combination appliances - were found to have much lower CE at similar flow rates, compared to devices with capture hoods. For almost all exhaust devices and especially for rear-mounted downdraft exhaust and microwaves, CE was substantially higher for back compared with front burner use. Flow rate, and the extent to which the exhaust device extends over the burners that are in use, also had a large effect on CE.

Controversy surrounding the impact of drilling on air and water quality has pitted industry and leaseholders against individuals and groups concerned with environmental protection and public health. Because animals often are exposed continually to air, soil, and groundwater and have more frequent reproductive cycles, animals can be used as sentinels to monitor impacts to human health. This study involved interviews with animal owners who live near gas drilling operations. The findings illustrate which aspects of the drilling process may lead to health problems and suggest modifications that would lessen but not eliminate impacts. Complete evidence regarding health impacts of gas drilling cannot be obtained due to incomplete testing and disclosure of chemicals, and nondisclosure agreements.

Vista Park Drive, Tucson, AZ, 85739, United States","Oil and Gas Exploration and Production activities are carried out in hazardous environments in many parts of the world. Recent events in the Gulf of Mexico highlight those risks and underline the importance of considering human factors during facility design. Ergonomic factors such as machinery design, facility and accommodation layout and the organization of work activities have been systematically considered over the past twenty years on a limited number of offshore facility design projects to a) minimize the occupational risks to personnel, b) support operations and maintenance tasks and c) improve personnel wellbeing. During this period, several regulators and industry bodies such as the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), the UK's Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Oil and Gas Producers (OGP), and Norway's Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) have developed specific HFE design standards and guidance documents for the application of Human Factors Engineering (HFE) to the design and operation of Oil and Gas projects. However, despite the existence of these guidance and recommended design practise documents, and documented proof of their value in enhancing crew safety and efficiency, HFE is still not well understood across the industry and application across projects is inconsistent. This paper summarizes the key Oil and Gas industry bodies' HFE guidance documents, identifies recurring themes and current trends in the use of these standards, provides examples of where and how these HFE standards have been used on past major offshore facility design projects, and suggests criteria for selecting the appropriate HFE strategy and tasks for future major oil and gas projects. It also provides a short history of the application of HFE to the offshore industry, beginning with the use of ASTM F 1166 to a major operator's Deepwater Gulf of Mexico facility in 1990 and the application of HFE to diverse world regions. This latter point highlights the need to consider user populations when selecting HFE design criteria, an aspect strongly emphasized in current industry guidance. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

Rapid development of this field has been enabled by advances in hydrofracking techniques that include injection of chemical and physical agents deep underground. Response to public concern about potential adverse environmental and health impacts has led to the formation of state and national advisory committees. Objectives: We review the extent to which advisory committees formed in 2011 by President Obama and governors of the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania contain individuals with expertise pertinent to human environmental public health. We also analyze the extent to which human health issues are of concern to the public by reviewing presentations at the public meeting of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board (SEAB) Natural Gas Subcommittee formed by the U.S. President's directive. Results: At a public hearing held by the SEAB Natural Gas Subcommittee 62.7% of those not in favor of drilling mentioned health issues. Although public health is specified to be a concern in the executive orders forming these three advisory committees, we could identify no individuals with health expertise among the 52 members of the Pennsylvania Governor's Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission, the Maryland Marcellus Shale Safe Drilling Initiative Advisory Commission, or the SEAB Natural Gas Subcommittee.

At this stage of design, the freedom to change the conceptual design is very limited and whatever strategies to be implemented will only control the hazard. This paper reports on the development of inherent safety index known as a process stream index (PSI) for inherent safety level assessment at preliminary design stage from the perspective of an explosion. The aim for PSI is to calculate, compare and prioritize the level of inherent safety of process streams during simulation work that influences the explosion. By prioritizing the streams based on the potential for the explosion, the design engineers can easily identify the critical streams to be considered for improvement in order to avoid or minimize explosion hazards. An enhancement technique to reflect the contribution of the individual components in the mixture is introduced, which provide significant contribution to the ranking of inherent safety level of process streams.

However, little is known about the short-term effect of pollution generated by gas-fired power plants on the health of elderly people. Methods: During three months, daily emergency visits/hospital admissions of subjects living within 3 km from a gas-fueled power plant were counted and related to ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and particulate matter of median aerometric diameter &lt; 10 μm (PM10). A generalized additive model served to correlate visits/hospital admissions to pollutants, controlling for meteorological confounders. Results: Mean air concentrations of PM10 and NO 2 were higher after-than before the start of operation of the plant, with the highest concentrations recorded within 1 km. Although pollutants were below the limits set by the European legislation, in elderly people there was a positive correlation between the number of emergency visits and daily air concentrations of PM10 and NO 2, as measured at 1 and 3 km from the plant. In subjects aged 70 years or more, the number of hospital admissions was positively correlated with PM10 levels measured within 3 km from the power plant, whereas in older subjects (≥ 80 year) it was also significantly linked with the lowest air concentration of PM10 (measured at 6 km from the plant). Discussion: Combustion of natural gas for energy generation produces a rise in air concentration of PM10 and NO 2 close to the plant, with a concentration-dependent increment of daily emergency visits and hospital admissions in elderly people, and with an age-dependent susceptibility. © 2011 European Federation of Internal Medicine.",Air pollution; Elderly; Natural-gas power plant; NO 2; PM10,"nitrogen dioxide; adult; aged; air pollutant; article; elderly care; emergency medicine; gas; health service; hospital admission; human; nuclear power plant; particulate matter; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Child; Child, Preschool; Emergency Service, Hospital; Environmental Health; Follow-Up Studies; Gas, Natural; Hospitalization; Hospitals, District; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Italy; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Patient Admission; Power Plants; Seasons; Sulfur Dioxide; Time Factors; Young Adult","Di Ciaula, A.; Section of Internal Medicine, Via Bovio, 70057 Bisceglie (BAT), Italy; эл. почта: agostinodiciaula@tiscali.it",,,09536205,,EJIME,22284257.0,English,Eur.

Taking the explosive danger caused by natural gas leakage as an example, the purpose of this paper, based on the box model, is to examine how such an environmental hazard can be hindered by the variation of building heights in the context of urban safety design and land-use decision making. Design/methodology/approach: The box model measures the concentration of pollutants within a defined box in which a mixture of pollutants with air and their transport by wind take place. A street surrounded by tall buildings in the city center is a good example for the application of such a model, and the building heights shape the box size and the mixing height. Under the consideration of atmospheric conditions this study identifies how the constellation of physical factors shaping the city-street box and its change affect the elapsed time to reach the lower explosive limit (LEL) and the upper explosive limit (UEL) of natural gas. Findings: Ceteris paribus higher building heights expand the time span between initial gas leakage and reaching LEL, in which appropriate safety measures should be taken before ignition, but more rapidly increases the elapsed time to reach UEL, making the time scope for potential explosive danger in the city center even larger. Originality/value: In the past, the aspect of preventing explosive dangers caused by natural gas leakage has been largely ignored in the building height regulations related to urban safety design and city center development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Box model; Building height; Cities; Explosions; Fire; Natural gas; Natural gas leakage; Pipelines; Prevention of explosion; Urban safety design,,"Nam, C.

There are many contributing factors which could affect decisions about water consumption including taste, smell, color, safety, cost, and convenience. However, few studies have investigated what parents with young children think about water quality and safety in the US and how this affects the choices they are making. This study aimed to describe the perceptions of parents with regard to water quality and safety and to compare bottled water and tap water use, as well as to examine motivation for water choices. We conducted an online questionnaire to survey parents living in Pennsylvania about water quality and safety, and preference for bottled versus tap water. Parents were recruited through child care centers, and 143 surveys were returned. The survey results showed high overall scores for perception of tap water quality and safety, and a preference for tap water over bottled water. We found that parents were concerned for the environmental impact that buying bottled water may have but were also concerned about potential contamination of tap water by natural gas drilling processes and nuclear power plants. These findings regarding parental concerns are critical to inform pediatric health care providers, water sellers, and suppliers in order that they may provide parents with the necessary information to make educated choices for their families. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Drinking water; Survey research; Water quality; Water safety,"drinking water; article; decision making; drinking; human; infant; parent; perception; preschool child; psychological aspect; safety; standard; United States; water quality; water supply; Child, Preschool; Choice Behavior; Drinking; Drinking Water; Humans; Infant; Parents; Pennsylvania; Perception; Safety; Water Quality; Water Supply","Merkel, L.; Penn State College of Medicine, 500 University Dr., H108, Hershey, PA 17033, United States; эл. почта: LMerkel@hmc.psu.edu",,,00945145,,JCMHB,21717208.0,English,J.

Our knowledge of physical and geochemical factors regulating methanogenesis is still in its infancy. We hypothesized that in these closed systems, trace elements (as micronutrients) are a limiting factor for methanogenic growth and activity. Trace elements are essential components of enzymes or cofactors of metabolic pathways associated with methanogenesis. This study examined the effects of eight trace elements (iron, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, manganese, boron, and copper) on methane production, on mcrA transcript levels, and on methanogenic community structure in enrichment cultures obtained from coal bed methane (CBM) well produced water samples from the Powder River Basin, Wyoming. Methane production was shown to be limited both by a lack of additional trace elements as well as by the addition of an overly concentrated trace element mixture. Addition of trace elements at concentrations optimized for standard media enhanced methane production by 37%. After 7 days of incubation, the levels of mcrA transcripts in enrichment cultures with trace element amendment were much higher than in cultures without amendment. Transcript levels of mcrA correlated positively with elevated rates of methane production in supplemented enrichments (R2 = 0.95). Metabolically active methanogens, identified by clone sequences of mcrA mRNA retrieved from enrichment cultures, were closely related to Methanobacterium subterraneum and Methanobacterium formicicum. Enrichment cultures were dominated by M. subterraneum and had slightly higher predicted methanogenic richness, but less diversity than enrichment cultures without amendments. These results suggest that varying concentrations of trace elements in produced water from different subsurface coal wells may cause changing levels of CBM production and alter the composition of the active methanogenic community. © 2012 Ünal, Perry, Sheth, Gomez-Alvarez, Chin and Nüsslein.",Coal bed methane; Enrichments; Mcra transcript; Methanogens; Trace elements,,"Nüsslein, K.; Department of Microbiology, University of Massachusetts, 203 Morrill Science Center IVN, 639 North Pleasant Street, Amherst, MA 01003, United States; эл. почта: nusslein@microbio.umass.edu",,Frontiers Research Foundation,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

Potential health impacts to air and water quality related to shale drilling are addressed within the context of the CHNs role of educator, case finder, advocate and researcher. Since 2005, an estimated 5,500 unconventional natural gas wells have been drilled in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale (Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection [PA DEP], n.d.), resulting in tremendous controversy throughout the state regarding impacts to human health and the environment. Although there are numerous anecdotal reports of illnesses in humans and animals living in drilling areas, there is a notable lack of peer-reviewed research on the impacts. Research efforts are underway to study these issues, including a proposed retrospective study of hospital and clinic data by Geisinger Health System's Weis Center for Research (Begos, 2012). However, CHNs have the opportunity and the responsibility to help address potential environmental health issues related to shale drilling, even in the face of scientific uncertainty. This responsibility is highlighted by the American Nurses Association's (ANA) (2003, p. 2) adoption of the Precautionary Principle, which states that ""when an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically."" CHN practice includes the promotion and preservation of health, and the prevention of disease, as well as assisting people in their response to illness (Maurer & Smith, 2009). In Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale regions, CHNs must assume the critical nursing roles of educator, case finder, advocate and researcher when addressing the health needs in shale drilling communities. Unfortunately, CHNs practicing within these regions may feel unprepared to take on these roles related to unconventional gas extraction. The following discusses these CHN roles in the context of environmental health impacts of shale drilling on air and water quality.",,"natural gas; article; community health nursing; environmental disease; environmental health; human; mining; nurse attitude; United States; Community Health Nursing; Environmental Health; Environmental Illness; Extraction and Processing Industry; Gas, Natural; Humans; Nurse's Role; Pennsylvania","McDermott-Levy, R.",,,00314617,,,23155825.0,English,Pa Nurse,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871894799

Here we assess the level of GHG emissions from shale gas well hydraulic fracturing operations in the United States during 2010. Data from each of the approximately 4000 horizontal shale gas wells brought online that year are used to show that about 900 Gg CH4 of potential fugitive emissions were generated by these operations, or 228 Mg CH4 per well - a figure inappropriately used in analyses of the GHG impact of shale gas. In fact, along with simply venting gas produced during the completion of shale gas wells, two additional techniques are widely used to handle these potential emissions: gas flaring and reduced emission 'green' completions. The use of flaring and reduced emission completions reduce the levels of actual fugitive emissions from shale well completion operations to about 216 Gg CH4, or 50 Mg CH4 per well, a release substantially lower than several widely quoted estimates.

Methods The following studies were combined: an analysis of secondary data and analysis of databases provided by the Promigas foundation, demographic data from the 2005 DANE census and databases regarding Central Bank economic statistical series; an analysis of the burden of disease estimated from parameters identified in previous studies; an analysis of the cost of the burden of illness and the estimated costs which were avoided by implementing the HNG connections program; and an analysis of the cost effectiveness of the program linking homes to HNG services. Results The OBA project led to about 4,000 to 5,000 cases of acute respiratory disease (ARD) and 1,200 to 2,300 outpatient cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) being avoided during the study period; around 1,200 hospitalizations due to ARD and 500 due to COPD were also avoided. Forty-five to 170 deaths (representing about 45,000 to 90,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALY)) were also avoided. The economic cost of the burden of disease arising from ARI and COPD in such scenario without HNG would have been between 10.7 and 23.6 million dollars, whilst HNG led to costs becoming reduced by about 32 %.

Much of the existing literature relies on decades-old estimates for water intensity, particularly regarding water consumed for fuel extraction. This work uses contemporary data from specific resource basins and power plants in Texas to evaluate water intensity at three major stages of coal and natural gas fuel cycles: fuel extraction, power plant cooling and power plant emissions controls. In particular, the water intensity of fuel extraction is quantified for Texas lignite, conventional natural gas and 11 unconventional natural gas basins in Texas, including major second-order impacts associated with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. Despite the rise of this water-intensive natural gas extraction method, natural gas extraction appears to consume less freshwater than coal per unit of energy extracted in Texas because of the high water intensity of Texas lignite extraction. This work uses new resource basin and power plant level water intensity data to estimate the potential effects of coal to natural gas fuel switching in Texas power sector, a shift under consideration due to potential environmental benefits and very low natural gas prices. Replacing Texas coal-fired power plants with natural gas combined cycle plants (NGCCs) would reduce annual freshwater consumption in the state by an estimated 53 billion gallons per year, or 60% of Texas coal powers water footprint, largely due to the higher efficiency of NGCCs. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",coal; electric power; energy-water nexus; life cycle analysis; natural gas; water intensity,Coal; Coal deposits; Combined cycle power plants; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuels; Hydraulic fracturing; Life cycle; Lignite; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Water; Water distribution systems; Water resources; Air emissions controls; Coal-fired power plant; Electric power; energy-water nexus; Fresh water consumption; Life cycle analysis; Natural gas combined cycle plants; Unconventional natural gas; Extraction; coal-fired power plant; cooling; emission control; fossil fuel; life cycle analysis; natural gas; power plant; Quaternary; thermal power; water use; Texas; United States,"Grubert, E.A.; Department of Environmental and Water Resources Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, United States",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867752815

Methods: Air samples were collected on mixed cellulose ester membrane filters in personal air samplers and then analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (NIOSH Method 7300). For all participants, urine samples were collected during the entire work shift, and Mn in urine was determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy according to NIOSH Method 8310. Spirometric measurements were also done for participants. Results: The maximum exposures to airborne Mn and total fumes were 0. 304 ± 0. 256 mg/m3 and 21.52 ± 9.40 mg/m3, respectively. The urine Mn levels in the various groups ranged between 0.77 to 7.58 μg/l. The correlation between airborne Mn and urinary Mn was significant for total whole participants. Some values of spirometric indices were statistically lower in welders rather than controls. Conclusions: Our results indicate that many welders have been exposed to higher concentrations of Mn-containing welding fumes. Urinary Mn can be used as a biomarker for Mn exposure. There were weak inverse correlations between Mn-containing welding fumes and pulmonary function indices, and the inverse correlation between urinary Mn with forced vital capacities (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was significant.",Biomarker; Manganese; Natural gas transmission pipeline welders; Pulmonary disorders; Welding fumes,,"Golbabaei, F.; Department of Occupational Health Engineering, Iran; эл. почта: fgolbabaei@sina.tums.ac.ir",,Japan Society for Occupational Health,13419145,,JOCHF,22673643.0,English,J.

Biomass burning produces a relevant deterioration of air quality inside and outside houses, notably due to emissions of fine and ultra fine dust (PM10, PM2.5) according to reviewed studies. Important improvements in emission quality are obtained with the use of more efficient household heating systems, both in developed and in developing countries. Numerous studies have assessed the possible health effects produced by wood smoke, providing sufficient evidence that the indoor exposure to wood smoke, even in developed countries, can have adverse effects on human health. In 2010 IARC classified wood smoke as a possible human carcinogen.

Rural Matlab in Bangladesh has been partly supplied with natural gas since the early 1990s, which offered a natural experiment to investigate the long-term impact of IAP on cardiopulmonary mortality. Objective: This study sought to compare adult cardiopulmonary mortality in relation to household fuel type as a surrogate for exposure to indoor air pollution. Study Design: This was a retrospective cohort study. We identified all households in 11 villages in Matlab, Bangladesh, and categorized them as either supplied with natural gas or using solid fuel for cooking or heating since January 1, 2001. Cause-specific mortality data including cardiopulmonary deaths were obtained through verbal autopsy as part of a permanent surveillance. Person-years (PYs) of exposure were computed from baseline until the event. Subjects with missing information on cause of death, outward migration, or on fuel type were excluded. Event rates for each fuel category were calculated as well as the relative risk of dying with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Setting: Rural Matlab, Bangladesh. Patients: Adults 18 years of age or older. Outcome Measure: Death from cardiopulmonary diseases over a 10-year period. Findings: In total, 946 cardiopulmonary deaths occurred with 884 in the solid-fuel and 62 in the gas-supplied households (n = 7,565 and n = 508, respectively) over the 10-year period. Cardiopulmonary death rate was 6.2 per 1,000 PYs in the solid-fuel group and 5.3 per 1,000 PYs in people living in households using gas. Mortality due to cardiovascular event was 5.1 and 4.8 per 1,000 PY in people from the solid-fuel and gas-supplied households, respectively, and the incident rate ratio was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.41). Mortality due to respiratory disease was 1.2 and 0.5 per 1,000 PYs in the solid-fuel and gas-supplied groups, respectively, and the incident rate ratio was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.02 to 4.99). Interpretation: Household solid-fuel use is associated with increased respiratory mortality and nonsignificantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Reduction of exposure to pollution due to in-household solid-fuel use is likely to improve survival in Bangladeshi and similar populations. © 2012 World Heart Federation (Geneva).

Previous work has shown that interconnection of just a few wind plants across moderate distances could greatly reduce the ratio of fast- to slow-ramping generators in the balancing portfolio. We find that interconnection of aggregate regional wind plants would not reduce this ratio further but would reduce variability at all frequencies examined. Further, interconnection of just a few wind plants reduces the average hourly change in power output, but interconnection across regions provides little further reduction. Interconnection also reduces the magnitude of low-probability step changes and doubles firm power output (capacity available at least 92% of the time) compared with a single region. First-order analysis indicates that balancing wind and providing firm power with local natural gas turbines would be more cost-effective than with transmission interconnection. For net load, increased wind capacity would require more balancing resources but in the same proportions by frequency as currently, justifying the practice of treating wind as negative load. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Bonneville Power Authority; California ISO; Electric Reliability Council of Texas; Midwest ISO; net load variability; wind power variability,Industry; Thermoelectric power; Bonneville Power Authority; California ISO; Electric reliability council of texas; Midwest ISO; net load variability; Wind power variabilities; Wind power; frequency analysis; power plant; wind power; wind turbine; United States,"Fertig, E.; Department of Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States; эл. почта: efertig@andrew.cmu.edu",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866333499

Natural gas can offset coal, likely decreasing overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other air emissions such as SO2 and NO X. Previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies using limited system boundaries have attempted to quantify the benefit of offsetting coal use. However, these studies do not consider that relative regional fuel prices may contribute most to the choice of coal over natural gas. External incentives such as low natural gas prices compared to coal are required if natural gas is to displace coal. In this study, simplified economic dispatch models are used to determine how natural gas utilization will increase in the short-term in response to changes in natural gas prices in three US grid regions - ERCOT, MISO and PJM. The results indicate that the change in air emissions is lower than suggested by LCAs, since LCAs generally do not include the complexity of regional electricity grids. For instance, this study estimates that life cycle GHG emissions may, at best, decrease by 7-15% due to low natural gas prices, compared to almost 50% reductions estimated by previous LCAs. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",coal; dispatch model; electricity; emissions; natural gas,Air pollution; Coal; Electric industry; Electricity; Gas supply; Life cycle; Natural gas; Particulate emissions; Scheduling; Sulfur dioxide; Economic Dispatch; Electricity grids; Electricity sector; Life-cycle GHG emissions; Natural gas price; Natural gas utilization; Previous life; System boundary; Greenhouse gases; coal; electricity generation; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle; natural gas; nitrogen oxides; numerical model; price dynamics; sulfur dioxide; United States,"Venkatesh, A.; Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890, United States; эл. почта: aranya@cmu.edu",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865112827

Methods: For measuring segregation, we used generalized dissimilarity index for two group and multi group nominal variables and ordinal information theory index for ordinal variables. Sample data was obtained from Iranian latest national census and multilevel modeling with individual variables at level one and segregation indices measured at province level for socioeconomic status variables at level two were used to assess the effect of segregation on infant mortality. Results: Among individual factors, mother activity was a risk factor for infant mortality. Segregated provinces in regard to size of the house, ownership of a house and motorcycle, number of literate individual in the family and use of natural gas for cooking and heating had higher infant mortality. Segregation indices measured for education level, migration history, activity, marital status and existence of bathroom were negatively associated with infant mortality. Conclusion: Segregation of different contextual characteristics of neighborhood had different effects on health outcomes. Studying segregation of Social, Economic, and demographic factors, especially in communities, which are racially homogenous, might reveal new insights into dissimilarities in health.",Generalized dissimilarity index; Infant mortality; Information theory index; Residential segregation,,"Holakouie Naieni, K.; Dept. of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, , Tehran, Iran; эл. почта: holakoin@sina.tums.ac.ir",,Iranian Journal of Public Health,22516085,,,,English,Iran.

The use of current infrastructure to build this new low-emission system necessitates additional emissions of greenhouse gases, and the coal-based infrastructure will continue to emit substantial amounts of greenhouse gases as it is phased out. Furthermore, ocean thermal inertia delays the climate benefits of emissions reductions. By constructing a quantitative model of energy system transitions that includes life-cycle emissions and the central physics of greenhouse warming, we estimate the global warming expected to occur as a result of build-outs of new energy technologies ranging from 100GWe to 10TWe in size and 1100yr in duration. We show that rapid deployment of low-emission energy systems can do little to diminish the climate impacts in the first half of this century.

They receive great attention due to severe complications and high mortality rate. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated accidents one of the most important health-related problems among which burns are the most common. They impose different physical, psychological, economical and social damages to patients, as well as their family and society. In this research, the epidemiologic characteristics of children with burns were studied to find effective policies to reduce and prevent burns. Methods: This retrospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed during 2 years (from April 2010 to March 2011) on 303 children with burns. All children aged under 15 years and were admitted to Imam Musa Kazem Hospital. Data was extracted from patient documents via a valid and reliable checklist. All principles of confidentiality and patients' rights were respected. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics in SPSS. Findings: Most cases of burns (56.9%) were 1-3 year-old children (mean age: 3.71). In addition, 69% of children were male and 31% were female. The majority of burns were caused by boiling water (59.7%). Urban children constituted 57.4% of the cases. The average hospitalization period was 10.8 days (range: 1-60 days). Most children had grade 2 injury (49.2%) and a burn surface area of 11-20% (34%). The highest average burn surface areas were seen in natural gas explosion cases (31.2%) and milk burns (29.2%). In most children, the trunk was injured (66.4%). Conclusion: Findings of this research showed the high risk age groups and the risk factors of burns in children in Isfahan, Iran. The most common causes of burns were boiling water and flame. In this study, we saw an increase in gas explosion burns compared to a previous study in Isfahan in 2000. Preventive programs are required to train parents of high risk children regarding safety issues. Officials and policymakers should adapt precautionary and safety policies in preparing gas tanks and gas-burning equipments.

In the present review we aimed to summarize the empirical and clinical literature on controlling the access to means of suicide. Methods: This review made use of both MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science and the Cochrane library databases, identifying all English articles with the keywords ""suicide means"", ""suicide method"", ""suicide prediction"" or ""suicide prevention"" and other relevant keywords. Results: A number of factors may influence an individual's decision regarding method in a suicide act, but there is substantial support that easy access influences the choice of method. In many countries, restrictions of access to common means of suicide has lead to lower overall suicide rates, particularly regarding suicide by firearms in USA, detoxification of domestic and motor vehicle gas in England and other countries, toxic pesticides in rural areas, barriers at jumping sites and hanging, by introducing ""safe rooms"" in prisons and hospitals. Moreover, decline in prescription of barbiturates and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), as well as limitation of drugs pack size for paracetamol and salicylate has reduced suicides by overdose, while increased prescription of SSRIs seems to have lowered suicidal rates. Conclusions: Restriction to means of suicide may be particularly effective in contexts where the method is popular, highly lethal, widely available, and/or not easily substituted by other similar methods. However, since there is some risk of means substitution, restriction of access should be implemented in conjunction with other suicide prevention strategies. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Means of suicide; Restriction of means; Suicide,barbituric acid derivative; benzodiazepine derivative; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol; natural gas; paracetamol; parathion; pesticide; salicylic acid; serotonin uptake inhibitor; tricyclic antidepressant agent; asphyxia; carbon monoxide intoxication; decision making; detoxification; domestic gas detoxification; drowning; drug intoxication; drug overdose; exhaust gas; firearm; gas; gas poisoning; hanging; human; jumping; mass medium; prescription; review; risk factor; risk reduction; self poisoning; sex difference; suicide; suicide attempt; systematic review; toxic domestic gas; Firearms; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Pesticides; Suicide,"Mandelli, L.; Department of Health Sciences, Via De Sanctis, Campobasso 86100, Italy; эл. почта: laura.mandelli@unibo.it",,,16604601,,,22408588.0,English,Int.

The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated modelling approach, as part of the investment decision-making process, for optimising economic returns from LNG whilst taking into account uncertainty in various key input parameters. Design/methodology/approach: Inter-linked cash flow and pricing models of the LNG chain were constructed. Net present value was maximised based on selection of netback pricing variables and level of investment shareholding. Constraints were placed on the minimum acceptable returns. The risk affinity of the decision maker was captured in the form of a chance-constrained optimisation problem. A genetic algorithm was applied for numerical optimisation, in combination with Monte Carlo simulations to account for the stochastic nature of the problem. Findings: Based on the results of a case study, the deterministic solution, having no consideration to uncertainty, was found to be both sub-optimal and provided an unsatisfactory risk outcome. The stochastic approach yielded an optimal solution with due consideration to risk. Various scenarios show that the choice of the decision variables significantly impacts the trade-off between risk and returns along the LNG chain to government and investor. Research limitations/implications: The suitability of the methodology to the operational phase of the LNG business which incorporates different elements of risk, such as market dynamics and logistics, is as yet untested. Originality/value: This framework may be useful in the formulation of optimal commercial structure of firms, investment portfolio and gas/LNG pricing arrangements for host governments involved in the LNG business. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Decision making; Energy industry; Liquefied natural gas; Modelling; Natural gas; Optimization techniques; Profit maximization; Risk analysis,,"Furlonge, H.

Coral fragments were exposed to varying concentrations of condensate WAF during different reproductive phases: gametogenesis, early embryogenesis, and late embryogenesis (when nighttime planulation occurs). During gametogenesis, exposure to condensate WAF did not inhibit subsequent production of larvae. On the other hand, exposure to &gt;25% WAF of gravid corals, at early and late embryogenesis, resulted in abortion and early release of larvae, respectively, with higher percentages of larvae expelled in fragments treated with higher concentrations of condensate WAF at least 3h after onset of exposure. Aborted larvae during early embryogenesis were 'premature', as they are of small size (0.06±0.03mm 3), low metamorphic competency (54%), and white in coloration, with a pale brown oral end (indicating low density of zooxanthellae). Those larvae released at the latter part of embryogenesis are bigger in size (0.22±0.08mm 3), possess 100% metamorphic competency, and are brown in coloration (high density of zooxanthellae). Aside from direct effects on reproduction, fragment mortality index was higher in samples exposed to higher concentrations of condensate WAF (&gt;25%), hence lowering the number of potentially reproducing polyps. Altogether, exposure to &gt;25% natural gas condensate WAF for at least 3h can potentially disrupt the replenishment of coral populations due to negative effects on reproduction and early life processes. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Abortion; Coral reproduction; Oil pollution; Premature larvae; Reproduction effects; Toxicity,"natural gas; abortion; brood size; condensate; coral reef; gamete; larva; mortality; natural gas; oil pollution; pollution effect; population dynamics; reproduction; toxicity; article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; coral reef; embryo development; environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; larval development; larval stage; metamorphosis; plant gametogenesis; Pocillopora damicornis; reproductive toxicity; toxicity testing; Animals; Anthozoa; Gametogenesis; Gas, Natural; Larva; Pacific Ocean; Reproduction; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Anthozoa; Pocillopora damicornis","Villanueva, R.D.; The Marine Science Institute, , 1101 Quezon City, Philippines; эл. почта: villanuevr@yahoo.com",,,01476513,,EESAD,21862129.0,English,Ecotoxicol.

Their municipalities are suffering the consequences of rapid urbanization, especially after the discovery of large reserves of petroleum and natural gas (PNG) in the Campos Basin. Objective: To describe the socio-economic profile of the region and compare their indicators in space and time. Methods: This is an ecological study, which made comparisons between the 11 municipalities of EMA-5. It is based on the behavior of the indicators before and after the increase in royalties and special participatioms (RPE) and the division of the production areas of PNG (main production area - MPA - and the border zone of MPA, BZMPA). The period of analysis of the indicators ranged from 1991 to 2005. Results: Higher values of gross domestic product per capita were found in the municipalities of MPA, especially Macaé. The same occurred in the RPE per capita, especially Rio das Ostras (higher value) and Nova Friburgo (lower value). In 2004, more than 50% of total revenues of municipalities were dependent on the funds derived from royalties. In 2000, Nova Friburgo had the best Human Development Index. The highest value of the Quality Index of Municipalities Potential for Development was found in Macaé. The major indexes of Social Exclusion was found in Macaé, Nova Friburgo and Rio das Ostras. Conclusion: It was found, in the municipalities of MPA, economic growth with great exclusive reliance on royalties.

Total concentrations of PAHs (∑PAHs) were revealed with similar patterns of temporal trends in the tree-rings at both sites, suggesting tree-rings recorded the historical variation in atmospheric PAHs. The differences of individual PAHs and of ∑PAHs detected in the tree-rings between the two sites reflected the historical differences of airborne PAHs. Regional changes in industrial activities might contribute to the site-specific and period-specific patterns of the tree-ring PAHs. The diagnostic PAH ratios of Ant/(Ant + PA), FL/(FL + Pyr), and BaA/(BaA + Chr)) revealed that PAHs in the tree-rings at both sites mainly stemmed from the combustion process (pyrogenic sources). Principal component analysis further confirmed that wood burning, coal combustion, diesel, and gasoline-powered vehicular emissions were the dominant contributors of PAHs sources at DSK, while diesel combustion, gasoline and natural gas combustion, and incomplete coal combustion were responsible for the main origins of PAHs at XQS. Tree-ring analysis of PAHs was indicative of PAHs from a mixture of sources of combustion, thus minimizing the bias of short-term active air sampling. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"coal; diesel fuel; gasoline; natural gas; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; airborne particle; analytic method; article; China; combustion; industrial area; pine; Pinus massoniana; priority journal; river; wood; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Atmosphere; Automobiles; China; Environmental Monitoring; Industry; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Pinus; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Rivers; Vehicle Emissions; Pinus massoniana","Kuang, Y.-W.; Institute of Ecology, 23 Xingke Road Tianhe District, Guangzhou 510650, China; эл. почта: kuangyw@scbg.ac.cn",,,14640325,,JEMOF,21842041.0,English,J.

Rivers constitute the second most important source of household water supply in Nigeria. Yet, rivers are major receptors of oil pollution. This paper focuses specifically on oil Pipeline River crossing upstream of Lokoja (on the Niger River) to demonstrate likely oil slick migration trend, herein referred to as oil travel time (OTT). An OTT describes the average time it takes lead oil plume to arrive at a downstream destination. The primary objective of this paper is to facilitate timely warning for water and environmental managers through OTT prediction; and, provide valuable information for contingency planning, monitoring and impact assessment. Method applied is the Hydraulic Geometry (HG) model using historic mean daily discharge MDQ (m3 s-1) (1980-2008), hydraulic characteristics: width w (m), mean depth d (d), mean velocity v (m s-1) and 3% 'differential oil-water velocity' of wind speed (m s-1) at Lokoja. Results suggest that any spilled oil at the pipeline river crossing is likely to hit key receptors (e.g. water reservoir ∼34km downstream) in 4 hours during high flow and takes ∼9 days to reach Onitsha (∼240km downstream) during low flow. This prediction is based on at-a-station HG using logarithmic regression (R 2 = 0.8447). Power regression was also used but had weaker R 2 value of 0.6175; hence the former appears more reliable. The absence of adequate data for other cross-sections downstream of the lower Niger River makes downstream HG less useful in this study. There is urgent need for more data points and systematic survey along the lower Niger to enhance downstream HG OTT prediction. This study represents the first known attempt to predict OTT in Nigerian Rivers using historic intermediate environmental data, though there have been a number of studies on marine/coastal oil spill incidents. This level of analysis is expected in every EIA where oil transport pipeline crosses rivers/streams. It is hoped that the results and the models used in this study would form useful basis for impact assessment in the ongoing efforts to explore oil at the inland river basins of Nigeria known as Nigerian Frontier Inland Sedimentary Basins (NFISB).

However, safety assessment during the well construction process is not a trivial issue. Available risk evaluation approaches are based on static analyses of existent systems, not allowing a dynamic evaluation of the risk at each alteration of circumstances. This work proposes the use of quantitative and dynamic risk assessment (QDRA) to assess the degree of safety of each planned job. The QDRA is a type of ""safe job analysis"" approach, developed to quantify the ""degree of safety"" in the entire well construction process, as well as during maintenance activities. The proposed methodology presents the definitions of ""barrier"" and ""integrated barriers set (IBS)"", as well as the modeling technique showing their relationships and it compares it with the analysis presented at Norwegian standard (NORSOK D-010). This technique has been applied not only during the planning stages of well construction but also during workover to analyze the number of available IBSes for each operation. The greatest advantage of this technique is that it can be applied during the planning stages of well construction and maintenance, where the effects of hazard on the job sequence are important unknowns.

Discussion: Pre-employment medicals are often unpopular as practices struggle to cope with excessive workloads. However, with good time management, prior assessment of the supplied paperwork and the addition of some further questions on health and lifestyle, medicals can provide a good assessment of a patient and assist in the prevention or management of potential or chronic health problems. The medical also provides an excellent opportunity to promote health and to assist in disease and injury prevention by providing feedback for a healthier lifestyle and injury prevention.

And yet, even if shrimp, oysters, and finfish are unaffected by the BP Oil Spill - a big if - one can already reflect on the passing of the culture once built upon gathering them. For almost three centuries, levees made life possible along the riverbanks and in the wetlands beyond. Those same levees also ensured the wetlands would eventually melt away into the Gulf. Cutting off the silt left behind during annual river inundations subjected the fragile land to erosion. Sulfur, natural gas, and oil production companies dug twenty thousand miles of canals to gain more direct routes to their fields and to pump out their mineral wealth.

Our aim was to further test this hypothesis. Methods. We analysed the data from 47,139 most recent singleton births during preceding five years of 2005-06 India Demographic Health Survey (DHS). Information about birth weight from child health card and/or mothers' recall) was analysed. Since birth weight was not recorded for nearly 60% of the reported births, maternal self-report of child's size at birth was used as a proxy. Fuel type was classified as high pollution fuels (wood, straw, animal dung, and crop residues kerosene, coal and charcoal), and low pollution fuels (electricity, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas and biogas). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were developed using SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure in SAS system. We used three logistic regression models in which child factors, maternal factors and demographic factors were added step-by-step to the main exposure variable. Adjusted Odds Ratios (AORs) and their 95% CI were calculated. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: Child's birth weight was available for only 19,270 (41%) births; 3113 from health card and 16,157 from mothers' recall. For available data, mean birth weight was 2846.5 grams (SD = 684.6). Children born in households using high pollution fuels were 73 grams lighter than those born in households using low pollution fuels (mean birth weight 2883.8 grams versus 2810.7 grams, p < 0.001). Use of biomass fuels was associated with size at birth. Unadjusted OR was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.27 1.55). Adjusted OR after controlling for child factors was 1.41 (95% CI 1.29, 1.57). AOR after controlling for both child and maternal factors was 1.21 (95% CI 1.06, 1.32). In final model AOR was 1.07 (95% 0.94, 1.22) after controlling for child, maternal and demographic factors. Gender, birth order, mother's BMI, haemoglobin level and education were significant in all three models. Conclusions: Use of biomass fuels is associated with child size at birth. Future studies should investigate this association using more direct methods for measurement of exposure to smoke emitted from biomass fuels and birth weight. © 2011 Sreeramareddy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"air pollution; article; biomass; environmental exposure; female; fire; health survey; human; India; low birth weight; newborn; statistical model; Air Pollution; Biomass; Female; Fires; Health Surveys; Humans; India; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Maternal Exposure","Sreeramareddy, C.T.; Department of Community Medicine, Jalan Batu Hampar, Bukit Baru, Melaka, Malaysia; эл. почта: chandrashekharats@yahoo.com",,,14712458,,,21619613.0,English,BMC Public Health,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957485975

That means that CCS must deliver consistent environmental and social benefits which exceed its costs of capital, energy and operation; it must be protective of the environment and human health over the long term; and it must be suitable for deployment on a significant scale. CCS is one of the more expensive and technically challenging carbon emissions abatement options available, and CCS must first and foremost be considered in the context of the other things that can be done to reduce emissions, as a part of an overall optimally efficient, sustainable and economic mitigation plan. This elevates the analysis beyond a simple comparison of the cost per tonne of CO 2 abated-there are inherent tradeoffs with a range of other factors (such as water, NOx, SOx, biodiversity, energy, and human health and safety, among others) which must also be considered if we are to achieve truly sustainable mitigation. The full life-cycle cost of CCS must be considered in the context of the overall social, environmental and economic benefits which it creates, and the costs associated with environmental and social risks it presents. Such analysis reveals that all CCS is not created equal. There is a wide range of technological options available which can be used in a variety of industries and applications-indeed CCS is not applicable to every industry. Stationary fossil- fuel powered energy and large scale petroleum industry operations are two examples of industries which could benefit from CCS. Capturing and geo-sequestering CO 2 entrained in natural gas can be economic and sustainable at relatively low carbon prices, and in many jurisdictions makes financial sense for operators to deploy now, if suitable secure disposal reservoirs are available close by. Retrofitting existing coal-fired power plants, however, is more expensive and technically challenging, and the economic sustainability of post-combustion capture retrofit needs to be compared on a portfolio basis to the relative overall net benefit of CCS on new-build plants, where energy efficiency can be optimised as a first step, and locations can be selected with sequestration sites in mind. Examples from the natural gas processing, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and coal-fired power generation sectors, illustrate that there is currently a wide range of financial costs for CCS, depending on how and where it is applied, but equally, environmental and social benefits of emissions reduction can be considerable. Some CCS applications are far more economic and sustainable than others. CCS must be considered in the context of the other things that a business can do to eliminate emissions, such as far-reaching efforts to improve energy efficiency. © 2011 by the authors.",CCS; Climate; CO 2; Economics; Geosequestration; Greenhouse gas; LNG; Sustainability,carbon; carbon dioxide; coal; fossil fuel; nitrogen oxide; sulfur oxide; article; biodiversity; biosafety; biotechnology; carbon capture and storage; combustion; cost benefit analysis; electric power plant; energy resource; environmental management; environmental protection; gas turbine power; health status; life cycle; petrochemical industry; socioeconomics; sustainable development; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Power Plants,"Hardisty, P.

The main source of radon is the soil, but the gas can enter buildings in many different ways and reach high indoor concentrations. Monitoring surveys have been promoted in many countries in order to assess the exposure of people to radon. In this paper, two complementary aspects are investigated. Firstly, we mapped indoor radon concentration in a large and inhomogeneous region using a geostatistical approach which borrows strength from the geologic nature of the soil. Secondly, knowing that geologic and anthropogenic factors, such as building characteristics, can foster the gas to flow into a building or protect against this, we evaluated these effects through a multiple regression model which takes into account the spatial correlation of the data. This allows us to rank different building typologies, identified by architectonic and geological characteristics, according to their proneness to radon. Our results suggest the opportunity to differentiate construction requirements in a large and inhomogeneous area, as the one considered in this paper, according to different places and provide a method to identify those dwellings which should be monitored more carefully. © 2011 by the authors.",Building factors; Geological class; Geostatistics; IRWGLS; Kriging with external drift; Radon,"radon; architecture; article; building; concentration (parameters); gas flow; geography; geostatistical analysis; Italy; kriging; radiation detection; radiation protection; soil property; Air Pollution, Indoor; Geologic Sediments; Housing; Italy; Radon; Regression Analysis","Borgoni, R.; Department of Statistics, Via Bicocca degli Arcimboldi 8, 20126 Milan, Italy; эл. почта: riccardo.borgoni@unimib.it",,,16604601,,,21655128.0,English,Int.

Numerous reports exist analyzing the potential for sequestering carbon dioxide at various sites around the globe, but none have identified the potential for a statewide system in Florida, USA. In 2005, 83% of Florida's electrical energy was produced by natural gas, coal, or oil (e.g., fossil fuels), from power plants spread across the state. In addition, only limited research has been completed on evaluating optimal pipeline transportation networks to centralized carbon dioxide repositories. This paper describes the feasibility and preliminary locations for an optimal centralized Florida-wide carbon sequestration repository. Linear programming optimization modeling is used to plan and route an idealized pipeline network to existing Florida power plants. Further analysis of the subsurface geology in these general locations will provide insight into the suitability of the subsurface conditions and the available capacity for carbon sequestration at selected possible repository sites.

Residences are important sites of exposure. To characterize residential exposures to UFP in some circumstances and to investigate governing factors, seven single-family houses in California were studied during 2007-2009. During multiday periods, time-resolved particle number concentrations were monitored indoors and outdoors and information was acquired concerning occupancy, source-related activities, and building operation. On average, occupants were home for 70% of their time. The geometric mean time-average residential exposure concentration for 21 study subjects was 14,500 particles per cm3 (GSD=1.8; arithmetic mean±standard deviation=17,000±10,300 particles per cm3). The average contribution to residential exposures from indoor episodic sources was 150% of the contribution from particles of outdoor origin. Unvented natural-gas pilot lights contributed up to 19% to exposure for the two households where present. Episodic indoor source activities, most notably cooking, caused the highest peak exposures and most of the variation in exposure among houses. Owing to the importance of indoor sources and variations in the infiltration factor, residential exposure to UFP cannot be characterized by ambient measurements alone. +Practical Implications: Indoor and outdoor sources each contribute to residential ultrafine particle (UFP) concentrations and exposures. Under the conditions investigated, peak exposure concentrations indoors were associated with cooking, using candles, or the use of a furnace. Active particle removal systems can mitigate exposure by reducing the persistence of particles indoors. Eliminating the use of unvented gas pilot lights on cooking appliances could also be beneficial. The study results indicate that characterization of human exposure to UFP, an air pollutant of emerging public health concern, cannot be accomplished without a good understanding of conditions inside residences. © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.",Cooking; House; Indoor sources; Indoor-outdoor relationship; Particle number,"air conditioning; air pollutant; article; cooking; dust; environmental exposure; housing; human; indoor air pollution; particle size; particulate matter; public health; risk assessment; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; California; Cooking; Dust; Environmental Exposure; Housing; Humans; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Public Health; Risk Assessment; Ventilation","Nazaroff, W.W.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 425 Davis Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720-1710, United States; эл. почта: nazaroff@ce.berkeley.edu",,,09056947,,INAIE,21029183.0,English,Indoor Air,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650894457

Methods Workers were categorized into 11 job titles, and both non-task (≤180 minutes sample duration) and task-related (<180 minutes) benzene concentrations were assessed. Approximately 800 personal air samples (406 non-task and 397 task-related) were analyzed. Results Non-task samples showed that concentrations varied significantly across job titles and generally resulted from exposures during short-duration tasks such as tank sampling. The contractor - tankerman job title had the highest average concentration [N=38, mean 1.4 parts per million (ppm), standard deviation (SD) 2.6]. Task-related samples indicated that the highest exposures were associated with the disconnection of cargo loading hoses (N=134, mean 11 ppm, SD 32). Non-task samples for specific job categories showed that concentrations have decreased over the past 30 years. Recognizing the potential for benzene exposure, this facility has required workers to use respiratory protective equipment during selected tasks and activities; thus, the concentrations measured were likely greater than those that the employee actually experienced. Conclusions This study provides a job title- and task-focused analysis of occupational exposure to benzene during dock facility operations that is insightful for understanding the Baton Rouge facility and others similar to it over the past 30 years.",Exposure assessment; Industrial hygiene; Marine transport,"benzene; air sampling; atmospheric chemistry; benzene; cargo handling; concentration (composition); crude oil; disease control; health impact; health risk; hygiene; maritime transportation; occupational exposure; oil industry; respiratory disease; air sampling; airborne particle; chemical industry; human; industrial hygiene; job characteristics; nonhuman; occupational exposure; oil industry; priority journal; review; United States; work environment; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Benzene; Chemical Industry; Humans; Limit of Detection; Louisiana; Occupational Exposure; Petroleum; Respiratory Protective Devices; Baton Rouge; Louisiana; United States; Rumex; Rumex","Gaffney, S.

The US Energy Information Administration projects that unconventional gas will supply nearly half of US gas production by 2035. In addition, by significantly expanding and diversifying the gas supply internationally, the exploitation of new unconventional gas resources has the potential to reshape energy policy at national and international levels - altering geopolitics and energy security, recasting the economics of energy technology investment decisions, and shifting trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In anticipation of this expansion, one of the perceived core advantages of unconventional gas - its relatively moderate GHG impact compared to coal - has recently come under scrutiny. In this paper, we compare the GHG footprints of conventional natural gas, unconventional natural gas (i.e.shale gas that has been produced using the process of hydraulic fracturing, or 'fracking'), and coal in a transparent and consistent way, focusing primarily on the electricity generation sector. We show that for electricity generation the GHG impacts of shale gas are 11% higher than those of conventional gas, and only 56% that of coal for standard assumptions. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",energy policy; fracking; greenhouse gases; hydraulic fracturing; shale gas; unconventional gas,,"Hultman, N.; School of Public Policy, University of Maryland, 2101 Van Munching Hall, College Park, MD 20742, United States",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-81355150981

We estimate that the development and completion of a typical Marcellus shale well results in roughly 5500t of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions or about 1.8 gCO2e/MJ of gas produced, assuming conservative estimates of the production lifetime of a typical well. This represents an 11% increase in GHG emissions relative to average domestic gas (excluding combustion) and a 3% increase relative to the life cycle emissions when combustion is included. The life cycle GHG emissions of Marcellus shale natural gas are estimated to be 63-75 gCO2e/MJ of gas produced with an average of 68gCO2e/MJ of gas produced. Marcellus shale natural gas GHG emissions are comparable to those of imported liquefied natural gas. Natural gas from the Marcellus shale has generally lower life cycle GHG emissions than coal for production of electricity in the absence of any effective carbon capture and storage processes, by 20-50% depending upon plant efficiencies and natural gas emissions variability. There is significant uncertainty in our Marcellus shale GHG emission estimates due to eventual production volumes and variability in flaring, construction and transportation. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",greenhouse gases; life cycle assessment; Marcellus shale; natural gas,,"Jiang, M.; Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053487186

Traditional safety engineering FPSO approaches developed over the past twenty years that apply to oil developments often do not automatically apply to these new floating applications. Inherent safety risks fundamental to the new application and the associated practical solutions needs to be understood and worked using a first principles approach, and may often result in the implementation of solutions involving counter intuitive philosophies and safety in design practices. These safety challenges of new floating applications involve engineers, fabricators, operators and certifying agencies and apply across all phases of project implementation. This paper maps out some of the key challenges and risks associated with the new floating structure applications. It also lays out the need for different thinking not only in the design process, but also in fabrication, testing and certification phases. Also addressed is the requirement for industry participation, as the ever increasing pressure for fast track project implementation continues in a situation where the oil and gas industry will be solving many first of a kind applications.

Present regulations require assessment of SCP severity based upon a testing procedure that involves casing pressure bleed-off followed with pressure buildup. The test analysis, however, is qualitative and risk qualification - arbitrary, with no insight of the gas migration process. The objective of this work is to consider SCP an environmental hazard and analyze the Bleedoff-Buidup (B-B) tests quantitatively to determine maximum possible emissions and their probabilistic risk. The maximum SCP is directly related to the potential failure of the well's containment and breaching of the gas outside the well. Proba-bilistic approach is used to analyze the uncertainty of the maximum casing shoe pressure resulting from SCP and the uncertainty in determination of casing shoe strength determined by Leak-off test (LOT).

The enteritis is linked to alcohol soluble components in SBM, but the mechanisms have not been established. Previous studies show that bacterial meal (BM) containing mainly Methylococcus capsulatus grown on natural gas is a suitable protein source for salmonids. The BM is rich in nucleotides, phospholipids, and small peptides that might be beneficial for intestinal homeostasis. In this study, a fish meal (FM)-based control diet (FM diet) and diets with 200 g/kg SBM (SBM diet), 300 g/kg BM(BM diet), and 300 g/kg BMand 200 g/kg SBM (BM-SBM diet) were fed to juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) for 80 d. Dietary inclusion of SBM reduced growth (P = 0.007). Inclusion of BM reduced digestibility of protein (P = 0.002) and lipids (P = 0.011) and increased (P < 0.01) the relative weights (g/kg whole body) of total gut, liver, and stomach, and mid and distal intestine. Fish fed the SBM diet developed enteritis, lacked carbonic anhydrase 12 in the brush border of epithelial cells in distal intestine, and had more epithelial cells reacting for proliferating cell nuclear antigen compared with fish fed the other diets. Fish fed the same amount of SBM combined with BM showed no signs of inflammation in the distal intestine. Our results demonstrate that BM grown on natural gas can be used to prevent SBM-induced enteritis in Atlantic salmon. © 2011 American Society for Nutrition.",,carbonate dehydratase; cycline; natural gas; probiotic agent; animal experiment; article; Atlantic salmon; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; controlled study; enteritis; intestine epithelium cell; Methylococcus capsulatus; nonhuman; soybean; Animal Feed; Animals; Enteritis; Fish Diseases; Fossil Fuels; Immunohistochemistry; Intestines; Methylococcus capsulatus; Nitrogen; Organ Size; Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen; Salmo salar; Soybeans; Bacteria (microorganisms); Glycine max; Methylococcus capsulatus; Salmo salar; Salmonidae,"Romarheim, O.

This new and emerging technology is expected to contribute a larger share of the world's gas-processing in the future. The overall objective of the paper is to develop an risk-based Environmental Management System (EMS), to assist the gas-processing industries to effectively implement and manage mitigation measures and also to reduce significant environmental risks from GTL industries. This risk based EMS provides information to government agencies, stakeholders, including policy makers, design and process engineers for making reasoned decisions by defining the range of risks associated with various options. This paper provides systematic approach to address the risks associated with GTL industries which involves impact identification, determination of severity, estimation of impact probability and evaluation of risk significance. The objectives of the paper are a) to develop the framework to assess the risks, b) to provide a qualitative assessment of the risks, in terms of the potential impact on different environmental components, c) to assess the relative significance of the risks and d) to identify and implement additional control measures to manage the environmental risks. Incorporating risk assessment into EMS allows environmental managers to prioritize risks, to identify the resources needed, and to control and manage the identified risk factors. A brief overview on EMS for GTL industries has been provided to address all activities that have been identified to have potentially significant risks on the environment during different scenarios.

Yemen LNG has developed a Cultural Heritage Action Plan (CHAP) to translate Yemen LNG's commitments and strategy for cultural heritage preservation and conservation in all its operational areas into practical actions. Although Yemen LNG-initiated cultural heritage actions should complement national cultural heritage management priorities to be effective, such a national strategy does not yet exist. Yemen LNG is therefore pioneering cultural heritage management in Yemen through its CHAP. Yemen LNG's presentation of the CHAP, and its objectives and actions to Government, and public and private stakeholders is discussed. The feedback it has received from stakeholders is also presented and evaluated. This paper summarises the: ■ cultural heritage of the Balhaf plant site and along the pipeline corridor; ■ main goals and priority objectives for preserving and conserving the cultural heritage present; ■ methods and mechanisms for achieving these objectives in the form of an action list; ■ phased approach to implementing actions initially during construction and then during plant operations; and ■ status of implementation for the actions addressed in the CHAP. As cultural heritage preservation is not only an essential cultural consideration but also an increasingly important legal and economic requirement, the CHAP also addresses cultural heritage related matters in contexts beyond the Yemen LNG project area.

We asked a diverse sample of 60 participants recruited from community groups in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to rank 10 technologies (e.g., coal with CCS, natural gas, nuclear, various renewables, and energy efficiency), and seven realistic low-carbon portfolios composed of these technologies, after receiving comprehensive and carefully balanced materials that explained the costs and benefits of each technology. Rankings were obtained in small group settings as well as individually before and after the group discussions. The ranking exercise asked participants to assume that the U.S. Congress had mandated a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from power plants to be built in the future. Overall, rankings suggest that participants favored energy efficiency, followed by nuclear power, integrated gasification combined-cycle coal with CCS and wind. The most preferred portfolio also included these technologies. We find that these informed members of the general public preferred diverse portfolios that contained CCS and nuclear over alternatives once they fully understood the benefits, cost, and limitations of each.

In a previous study from Austria, we demonstrated a significant, though small, reduction of lung function parameters in children living in homes with gas stoves. We used a larger international database to check if this finding can be generalised. To study the relative impact of cooking with gas on lung function parameters of primary school children in a wide range of geographical settings, we analysed flow and volume data of ∼24,000 children (aged 6-12 yrs) from nine countries in Europe and North America. Exposure information was obtained by comparable questionnaires and spirometry according to an American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society protocol. Linear regressions were used, controlling for individual risk factors and study area. Heterogeneity between study-specific results and mean effects were estimated using meta-analytical tools. On average, gas cooking reduced lung function parameters. Overall effects were small (-0.1-0.7%) and only significant for forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s. There was some indication that allergic children were more affected by gas cooking. Under current housing conditions, gas cooking is associated with only small reductions in lung function.

However, a significant portion of drylands occur over sedimentary basins hosting natural gas and oil reservoirs, with gas migration to the surface (named ""microseepage"") producing positive atmospheric CH4 fluxes. In this overview, we summarize the outcomes of microseepage surveys performed in different petroleum basins, describe how the microseepage area is estimated and what are the emission factors that can be used for a preliminary global emission estimate. Microseepage frequently overcomes methanotrophic consumption occurring in dry soil throughout large areas, and it is enhanced by faults and fractures in the rocks. Fluxes of a few tens to hundreds of mg m-2 d-1 are frequent for oil-gas fields, globally estimated at ~4 million km2. However, microseepage may potentially exist over a wider area (~8 million km2, i.e. 15% of global drylands), including the total petroleum system. Based on a relatively large and geographically dispersed data-set of emission factors from different hydrocarbon-prone basins in the USA and Europe, upscaling suggests that global microseepage emission exceeds 10 Tg y-1; it cannot be ignored in the atmospheric methane budget and in assessments for the sink potential of dry soil. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.",Geological sources; Methane; Seepage; Soil uptake,,"Etiope, G.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, via V.

However, significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from agricultural production processes must be considered. Among those, the production and use of fertilizer, and the resulting leaching of nitrous oxide (N2O), are crucial factors. This article provides an integrated life cycle assessment (LCA) of biogas (i.e. biomethane that has been upgraded and injected into the natural gas grid), taking into account the processes of fermentation, upgrading and injection to the grid for two different types of biogas plants. The analysis is based on different feedstocks from crop rotation systems for different locations in Germany. A special focus is on the sensitivity of assumptions of nitrous oxide emissions to overall GHG emissions. Much research exists on the measurement or modeling of the actual N2O emissions that result from farming processes. Since there is as yet no precise regional data, most analyses use tier-1 data from the IPCC national GHG inventories as a default. The present article coincides with recent research in indicating that this data varies at the regional level. However, it is not the scope of the article to evaluate the quality of existing data for N2O emissions, but to show the effects of different assumptions on the LCA of GHGs from bio-methane. Thus, a link between the provision of emission data and the practical implementation of biogas technology is provided. The main result is that the supply chain of substrates from agricultural processes appears to contribute the most to the GHG emissions of bio-methane. The ""worst case"" scenario where 5% of the nitrogen fertilizer used is emitted in form of N2O shows that the GHG mitigation potential of bio-methane versus natural gas is very small, so there is not much margin for error in the plant technology. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.",Biogas/bio-methane; Climate protection potential; LCA and optimization; N2O; Technological process chain,,"Arnold, K.; Wuppertal Institute for Climate, , Wuppertal, 42103, Germany; эл. почта: karin.arnold@wupperinst.org",,,1943815X,,,,English,J.

Due to its efficiency and low level of combustion emissions this reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to the use of other fossil fuels. However, being itself a potent greenhouse gas, a high level of direct losses of natural gas in its process chain could neutralise these advantages. Which effect will finally prevail depends on future economical as well as technical developments. Based on two different scenarios of the main influencing factors we can conclude that over the next two decades CH4 emissions from the natural gas supply chain can be significantly reduced, in spite of unfavourable developments of the supply structures.

Chemical quantification has been carried out for major anions, metal species, total OC and EC, and for individual organic marker species including n-alkanes, hopanes, PAHs, organic acids and sterols. Concentration levels of each chemical group are presented and the patterns of individual species used to infer predominant sources of atmospheric fine particles from atmospheric measurements. Temporal and spatial variations are also discussed. The annual mean PM2.5 concentrations were 11.6 and 10.5 g m-3, with large daily variations (2.7-37.1 g m-3) at the two sites. Elevated PM2.5 was mostly attributed to higher sulfate &gt; OC &gt; nitrate in summer and OC &gt; nitrate &gt; EC in winter. The mean levels of soil/dust related metals, Al &gt; Si &gt; Fe &gt; Ca &gt; Ti, were mostly different from other European sites due to differences in sampling site, local geology or climate, but comparable with earlier UK data. Trace metals, Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Pb &gt; Mn &gt; Ni, mostly showed lower concentrations compared with concentrations measured at the UK national metals network sites, except for Cu and Pb. The concentrations of PAHs were in a similar range to those previously measured within the UK, with an elevation at the urban site and in winter due to increased combustion activities, particularly for the two natural gas-related Oxy-PAHs. n-Alkanes showed a higher contribution in winter (low carbon preference index: 1.5-1.6) from anthropogenic emissions but in summer (high carbon preference index: 2.7-2.9) from biogenic sources, which are appreciable at our rural site (Cmax = 29). Similar levels of hopanes were observed at the urban (0.08-0.24 ng m-3) and the rural (0.07-0.23 ng m-3) site, with higher winter values at EROS as expected but opposite for CPSS. The concentrations of organic acids ranged from 0.19-10.2 ng m -3 at EROS and 0.26-6.0 ng m-3 at CPSS, with mixed patterns of seasonal variation (W/S: 0.54-2.0) for individual aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, except the two resin acids which exhibited much higher levels in winter (W/S: 1.7-3.3) as expected due to higher wood smoke emissions. Cholesterol showed very low annual mean concentrations (0.13-0.16 ng m-3) confirming that meat cooking is not an important source at our sites. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,alkane; aluminum; calcium; carboxylic acid derivative; cholesterol; copper; iron; lead; manganese; nickel; nitrate; organic compound; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; silicon; sterol derivative; sulfate; titanium; zinc; anion; carbon; chloride; metal; nitrate; sulfate; volatile organic compound; air sampling; article; atmospheric dispersion; chemical analysis; climate; combustion; concentration (parameters); dust; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; geology; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rural area; seasonal variation; species differentiation; summer; United Kingdom; urban area; winter; air pollutant; atmosphere; chemistry; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; Air Pollutants; Anions; Atmosphere; Carbon; Chlorides; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Great Britain; Metals; Nitrates; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Sulfates; Volatile Organic Compounds,"Harrison, R.

Decreased sense of smell can lead to significant impairment of quality of life, including taste disturbance and loss of pleasure from eating with resulting changes in weight and difficulty in avoiding health risks such as spoiled food or leaking natural gas. Recent epidemiological reports have shown that despite fairly low self-reported prevalence of these disorders in large population studies, when validated smell identification or threshold tests are used, they reveal quite a high prevalence of hyposmia and anosmia in certain groups, especially the elderly. Several different pathophysiologic processes, such as head trauma, aging, autoimmunity, and toxic exposures, can contribute to smell impairment, with distinct implications concerning prognosis and possible treatment. As allergists, we are most likely to see this symptom in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, and this now appears to be due more to the mucosal inflammation than to physical airway obstruction.

This study integrates information from a number of sources to describe the frequency, causes, and effects of these releases in order to inform analysis of risk from future hurricanes. Over 200 onshore releases of hazardous chemicals, petroleum, or natural gas were reported. Storm surge was responsible for the majority of petroleum releases and failure of storage tanks was the most common mechanism of release. Of the smaller number of hazardous chemical releases reported, many were associated with flaring from plant startup, shutdown, or process upset. In areas impacted by storm surge, 10% of the facilities within the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) databases and 28% of SIC 1311 facilities experienced accidental releases. In areas subject only to hurricane strength winds, a lower fraction (1% of RMP and TRI and 10% of SIC 1311 facilities) experienced a release while 1% of all facility types reported a release in areas that experienced tropical storm strength winds. Of industrial facilities surveyed, more experienced indirect disruptions such as displacement of workers, loss of electricity and communication systems, and difficulty acquiring supplies and contractors for operations or reconstruction (55%), than experienced releases. To reduce the risk of hazardous material releases and speed the return to normal operations under these difficult conditions, greater attention should be devoted to risk-based facility design and improved prevention and response planning. © 2010 Society for Risk Analysis.",Hazardous material; Hurricane; Storm surge,Accidental release; Facility designs; Hazardous chemicals; Hurricane katrina; Hurricane storm surge; Industrial facilities; Normal operations; Risk management plans; Risk-based; Storage tank; Storm surges; Toxic release inventories; Tropical storms; Communication systems; Floods; Hazardous materials; Hurricanes; Petroleum industry; Plant shutdowns; Plant startup; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Storms; Wave interference; Leakage (fluid); petroleum; communication network; electricity supply; hazardous waste; Hurricane Katrina 2005; industrial district; industrial waste; petroleum; risk assessment; storage tank; storm surge; toxic material; worker caste; article; dangerous goods; hurricane; industry; risk management; United States; Cyclonic Storms; Hazardous Substances; Industry; Louisiana; Petroleum; Risk Management,"Santella, N.; LCS College of Engineering and Computer Science, 223 Link Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244-1240, United States; эл. почта: nsantella@gmail.com",,,02724332,,RIAND,20345576.0,English,Risk Anal.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950813088

Police forces currently lack a simple, robust, efficient and reliable solution to perform this type of swabbing. In this article, we describe a study undertaken to develop a procedure for the collection of ignitable liquid residues on the hands of arson suspects. Sixteen different collection supports were considered and their applicability for the collection of gasoline traces present on hands and their subsequent analysis in a laboratory was evaluated. Background contamination, consisting of volatiles emanating from the collection supports, and collection efficiencies of the different sampling materials were assessed by passive headspace extraction with an activated charcoal strip (DFLEX device) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. After statistical treatment of the results, non-powdered latex gloves were retained as the most suitable method of sampling. On the basis of the obtained results, a prototype sampling kit was designed and tested. This kit is made of a three compartment multilayer bag enclosed in a sealed metal can and containing three pairs of non-powdered latex gloves: one to be worn by the sampler, one consisting of a blank sample and the last one to be worn by the person suspected to have been in contact with ignitable liquids. The design of the kit was developed to be efficient in preventing external and cross-contaminations. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Unsatisfactory labour practices and welfare conditions pose an operational and reputational risk to all projects, in addition to potential labour instability and the resultant negative effects on project and operational efficiencies, the perceptions of local communities and their future support during the operations phase could be positively or negatively influenced by the experience of local workers on site, which, in turn, could affect the project's social license to operate. The Yemen Liquefied Natural Gas project (Yemen LNG) will be, at over $US4 billion, the largest project in the country's history and utilised Labour Risk Audits and Labour Risk Management in order to create workforce stability and to retain and strengthen their social license to operate. At the peak of construction up to 12,000 workers of at least 60 nationalities were present on site, which in its itself posed unique challenges to the management of labour relations in a culturally diverse context. The Labour Risk Audits covered areas such as organisational design, human resources administration and the terms and conditions of employment, while Labour Risk Management focused on legal compliance in terms of Yemeni Labour Law and related legislation, welfare (i.e. camp standards, living conditions and catering), demobilisation of workers, and the monitoring of labour risk indicators (e.g. grievances). The paper describes the results and ratifies the need for Labour Risk Audits and Labour Risk Management on similar projects, as all could benefit from a stable and productive workforce, which in turn will also enhance the company's reputation and ensure a continued social license to operate.

All other characteristics being equal, a fuel or energy system with a higher EROI or EIR is of better quality because more energy is provided to society. I define and calculate the EIR for oil, natural gas, coal, and electricity as measures of the energy intensity (units of energy divided by money) of the energy resource relative to the energy intensity of the overall economy. EIR measures based upon various unit prices for energy (e.g. $/Btu of a barrel of oil) as well as total expenditures on energy supplies (e.g. total dollars spent on petroleum) indicate net energy at different points in the supply chain of the overall energy system. The results indicate that EIR is an easily calculated and effective proxy for EROI for US oil, gas, coal, and electricity. The EIR correlates well with previous EROI calculations, but adds additional information on energy resource quality within the supply chain. Furthermore, the EIR and EROI of oil and gas as well as coal were all in decline for two time periods within the last 40 years, and both time periods preceded economic recessions. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Energy; Energy economics; Energy intensity; Energy return on energy invested; Net energy,,"King, C.

One potential product, insulating concrete forms (ICFs), offers possible advantages in energy and environmental performance when compared with traditional construction materials. Even though ICFs are in part derived from a petroleum-based product, the benefits in the use phase outweigh the impacts of the raw material extraction and manufacturing phase. This paper quantitatively measures ICFs' performance through a comparative life cycle assessment of wall sections comprised of ICF and traditional wood-frame. The life cycle stages included raw materials extraction and manufacturing, construction, use and end of life for a 2,450 square foot house in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Results showed that even though building products such as ICFs are energy intensive to produce and thus have higher environmental impacts in the raw materials extraction and manufacturing phase, the use phase dominated in the life cycle. For the use phase, the home constructed of ICFs consumed 20 percent less energy when compared to a traditional wood-frame structure. The results of the impact assessment show that ICFs have higher impacts over wood homes in most impact categories. The high impacts arise from the raw materials extraction and manufacturing phase of ICFs. But there are a number of embedded unit processes such as disposal of solid waste and transport of natural gas that contribute to this high impact and identifying the top unit process and substance contributors to the impact category is not intuitive. Selecting different unit processes or impact assessment methods will yield dissimilar results and the tradeoffs associated with every building product should be considered after studying the entire life cycle in detail.",Building products; Environmental impacts; Insulating concrete forms; Life cycle assessment,,"Rajagopalan, N.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 949 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh PA 15261, United States; эл. почта: ner8@pitt.edu",,College Publishing,15526100,,,,English,J.

DWHR systems transfer heat from hot drain water to the shower's incoming cold water stream, thus reducing the demand on the hot water heater. There are various DWHR systems available that differ in heat exchanger type, cost, and performance. This article focuses on designing a flat plate and gravity fed heat exchangers for a range of residential showering conditions. This is useful since there currently is no peer-reviewed published data on the effectiveness of DWHR, nor is there published research considering the emissions reductions that can be achieved with realistic DWHR systems. The governing equations for heat exchangers are used to model empirical data and to derive implementation recommendations for DWHR design. The model is validated using a prototype flat plate heat exchanger and test stand under varying flow rates and temperatures. A Monte Carlo simulation of the results showed that DWHR could save an average $74 a year for homes with natural gas water heaters and $160 a year for homes with electric water heaters. This corresponds to 0.3 metric tons and 1.5 metric tons of CO2 offset per home per year for natural gas and electric water heaters, respectively. The results are compiled and organized into a software program that allows consumers to input their household showering habits and location to get an estimate of their CO2, energy, and cost savings to determine if they should install a DWHR system.",,,"Bartkowiak, S.; Graduate Student in Mechanical Engineering, United States; эл. почта: smbart@umich.edu",,College Publishing,15526100,,,,English,J.

Recent analysis indicates, however, that the rapid proliferation of oil and gas exploration zones now threatens the region's biodiversity, indigenous peoples, and wilderness areas. To better elucidate this dynamic situation, we analyzed official Peruvian government hydrocarbon information and generated a quantitative analysis of the past, present, and future of oil and gas activities in the Peruvian Amazon. We document an extensive hydrocarbon history for the region - over 104 000km of seismic lines and679 exploratory and production wells - highlighted by a major exploration boom in the early 1970s. We show that an unprecedented48.6% of the Peruvian Amazon has been recently covered by oil and gas concessions, up from just7.1% in2003. These oil and gas concessions overlap17.1% of the Peruvian Amazon protected area system and over half of all titled indigenous lands. Moreover, we found that up to72% of the Peruvian Amazon has been zoned for hydrocarbon activities (concessions plus technical evaluation agreements and proposed concessions) in the past two years, and over84% at some point during the past 40years. We project that the recent rapid proliferation of hydrocarbon zones will lead to a second exploration boom, characterized by over 20 000km of new seismic testing and construction of over 180 new exploratory wells in remote, intact, and sensitive forest areas. As the Peruvian Amazon oil frontier rapidly expands, we conclude that a rigorous policy debate is urgently needed in order to avoid the major environmental impacts associated with the first exploration boom of the 1970s and to minimize the social conflict that recently led to deadly encounters between indigenous protesters and government forces. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Amazonia; Indigenous peoples; Natural gas development; Oil development; Peruvian Amazon; Protected areas,Biodiversity; Conservation; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Oil well drilling; Public policy; Seismology; Amazonia; Indigenous people; Natural gas development; Oil development; Peruvian amazons; Protected areas; Hydrocarbons,"Finer, M.; Save America's Forests, 4 Library Court NW, Washington, DC 20003, United States; эл. почта: matt@saveamericasforests.org",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950656556

The results from a number of different gas wells revealed a huge concentration spread ranging from below the detection limit of 0.2 up to 1800 g/m3 TMAs (as As) in the gas. Due to the toxicity and corrosive nature of these arsines, they need near real time monitoring via a method that can easily be implemented on site, i.e. during gas exploitation. Here, we introduce a novel method which utilises silver nitrate impregnated silica gel tubes for quantitative chemotrapping of trimethylarsine (TMAs) from a natural gas matrix. Subsequent elution with hot nitric acid followed by online photo-oxidation hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS) is used for the determination of TMAs gas standards in nitrogen and natural gas samples, respectively. The chemotrapping method was validated using CT-GC-ICP-MS as a reference method. The recovery of arsenic from nitrogen or natural gas matrix ranged from 85 to 113% for a range of 20 to 2000 ng As. Trapping efficiency was &gt;98%, from the methods LOD of 20 ng to 4.8 g (absolute amount As) with sample sizes of 0.02 and 2 L gas. Method performance was established by comparing the results obtained for eight natural gas samples containing between 1 and 140 g As/m3 with those achieved by the reference method (CT-GC-ICP-MS). © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"arsenic; natural gas; nitrogen; trimethylarsine oxide; volatile agent; absorption; article; elution; gas chromatography; methodology; oxidation; priority journal; spectrofluorometry; Air Pollutants; Arsenicals; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Freezing; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Spectrometry, Fluorescence","Uroic, M.

The environmental risks of industry operations are many but are commonly associated with; drilling fluids containing toxic materials (including oil/grease, heavy metals, & naturally occurring radioactive materials); produced waters posing threat of accidental release; potential emissions of hydrogen sulfide in natural gas deposits with its deadly effects on human health; and blowout of exploratory wells (statistically, in 0.5-1% cases) under pressurized contents of a geologic formation resulting in harmful emissions; and other accidents severely impacting environment and the project economics. To focus on general environmental risks, statistics of environmental incidences and preventions related to well drilling, pipelines incidents and spills/leaks are described. Guidelines and some economically feasible options based on technological advances to minimize risks to environment & human health are also listed. However, the paper essentially emphasizes the importance of technological advances to reduce industry's operational and environmental compliance costs during all phases (exploration, drilling, production, transportation, and storage) of oil and gas exploration and production (E&P). An an example, using modern technology, a substantial cost reduction from $8M in 1980 to about $0.1M today is realized for a 50 sq-mile exploration survey. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that by 2020, the lower cost compliance technology programs could decrease cumulative industry environmental compliance costs by over $36 billion. The cost reduction coupled with better survey and monitoring data allows less intrusive methods with least impact on environment. Compliance cost reduction further provides opportunities for investing in continued research & development (R&D) towards achieving environmental protection goals. Therefore, special emphasis is to be given to applications of ""smart technological solutions"" in achieving essential goals of environmental protection, economic benefits and environmental sustainability. New exploration and production technologies for the petroleum industry are developed primarily to increase oil recovery and reduce the cost of recovery. Reducing costs often goes with reducing the environmental impact of exploration, drilling and completion procedures. The industry search for advanced technology to produce oil and to meet environmental regulations has developed new, improved techniques and strategies which accomplish both goals. Conducting operations that are ""Smarter, Farther, Deeper, Cleaner and Smaller"" makes good business sense and helps to protect the environment. Many oil companies have learned that going that one step farther to protect sensitive environments and avoid pollution, pays them back directly in increased economic benefits. In the US, petroleum production generates on average, 7 to 8 barrels (approximately 15 billion barrels annually) of wastewater or produced water per barrel of oil. Today, operators are using advanced reservoir management techniques as discussed above to enhance well placement and reduce water production. Downhole oil/water and gas/water separation could dramatically further reduce the amount of water produced up the wellbore, cutting operating costs, improving environment by decreasing the possibility of groundwater contamination from produced water spillage. Besides reducing environmental compliance costs, sensible use of modern technology results in lesser volume of waste produced in conjunction with re-use of resources (such as re-injection of treated wastewater) as well as provides speed and reliability of processing information. As an example, the cost of analyzing a 50-square mile survey for Oil & Gas operations has fallen from approximately $8 million in 1980, to just about $0.1 million today. Satellite imagery and aeromagnetic surveys are useful tools to pinpointing resources and reduce wastes. These methods allow engineers to better ""see"" underground to locate potential sources of oil and gas, dramatically improving exploration success rates, reducing drilling costs, and minimizing environmental impacts. Fiber optics sensor systems are increasingly being applied throughout a reservoir's life to optimize production. This helps to develop ""smart wells"" technology, which collects data on well performance and reservoir properties downhole that can be monitored from anywhere in the world via the Internet. Slim-hole drilling technology (drilling holes of a diameter of 6 inches or less) is changing exploration and production, especially in the early stages of exploration and in re-entering existing small-diameter wells to reach new reserves in mature fields. Even greater reductions in costs and environmental impacts can be achieved with more advanced technologies. Using above mentioned smart technologies during all phases of Oil & Gas industry is directly reducing overall operational costs and should achieve DOE's targeted goal of reducing the cumulative industry environmental compliance costs by over several billion dollars by next decade. The reduction in cost of environmental compliance and liability is directly benefiting additional research in finding new low cost technologies for the industry. The newer technologies in turn continue to further help reduce the overall environmental compliance costs while adequately protecting the environment.

Only sparse data on adverse health effects of THT on humans are available. Methods: We performed a literature search and clinical investigations including case history and cardiopulmonary diagnostic tests in two symptomatic THT-exposed outpatients. Results: The two THT-exposed city workers developed transient neurologic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, as well as skin and mucosa irritation, chronic rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia. The neurological symptoms and respiratory disorders were found to be caused by intermittently high THTexposures. In favor of a causal relationship were severe work-related neurological and respiratory symptoms in previously healthy workers, results of animal experiments, and another report with very similar findings in the literature. The etiology of arterial hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia, however, remains unclear. Conclusions: Our two case reports demonstrate that repeated high THT-exposures can-in addition to neurotoxic symptoms-elicit chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the availability of emergency medical services (EMS) system energy consumption data required to calculate a carbon footprint. Methods. Two diverse North American EMS systems with more than 125,000 combined annual unit responses agreed to report their energy consumption for the last fiscal or calendar year using a data-collection tool based on Carbon Trust recommendations. They also identified the source of information (e.g., bills, logs, receipts), whether the amounts reported were directly measured or estimated, and whether any of the amounts were prorated from shared facilities (e.g., electricity for a shared office building). For this proof-of-concept study, we report only descriptive data about the availability of data and aggregate carbon emissions. Results. Both systems reported diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity consumption. One system used natural gas; one system used aviation fuel. Direct measurement of consumption using utility bills and statements was possible for these energy types. One system prorated natural gas and electricity usage; one system was able to estimate commercial air travel. Annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for these two systems totaled 11.1 million pounds of CO2. The largest source of CO2 emissions was diesel fuel (39%), followed by electricity (23%). Conclusion. These EMS systems were able to provide the data necessary to determine their carbon footprints. Future research could include broader study to establish EMS-specific norms for carbon emissions, benchmarking of these metrics between different EMS systems, and the assessment of programs designed to reduce EMS carbon emissions.",Ambulances; Carbon footprinting; Emergency medical services; Energy-generating resources; Greenhouse effect; Transportation of patients,carbon dioxide; diesel fuel; gasoline; natural gas; article; electricity; emergency health service; energy consumption; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Emergency Medical Services; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; North America; Prospective Studies; Transportation of Patients; Vehicle Emissions,"Blanchard, I.; City of Calgary Emergency Medical Services, 3705-35 ST NE, #100, Calgary, AB T1Y 6C2, Canada; эл. почта: ieblanch@ucalgary.ca",,,10903127,,PEMCF,19731171.0,English,Prehosp.

This work studies the long term impact on the regional ambient air which can be attributable to three plants with different power outputs, fuel types, and stack heights. The study is carried out in an area with relatively flat topography and typical coastal meteorology. A dense air pollution monitoring network, operating for many years, makes this area a real life laboratory for studying the pollution routes, the impact of the sources at different directions and distances, and the effects of transition to cleaner fuel. The direct impact of each of the two large power plants on the ambient SO2 levels could be clearly detected in most of the monitoring stations at distances up to 40 km away. Interestingly, a relatively large impact can also be attributed to the indirect effect of emissions that are recirculated back to the region with the land breeze. The transition from using fuel oil to natural gas in one of the large power plants resulted in a dramatic reduction in the mean SO2 levels in all of the monitoring stations. The contribution of the industrial emissions to the ambient NO2 levels seems to be very modest relative to that from traffic. An analysis of the NO, NO2 and O3 records suggests that the highest mean NO2 concentrations, and a large proportion of the total NO2 encountered in the study area, are probably due to recirculated NOx emitted by traffic in a densely populated region north of it. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,fuel; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air pollution; ambient air; article; electric power plant; exhaust gas; meteorology; priority journal; topography; air pollution; electric power plant; human; industrial waste; Israel; temperature; time; wind; Air Pollution; Humans; Industrial Waste; Israel; Nitrogen Oxides; Power Plants; Sulfur Dioxide; Temperature; Time Factors; Wind,"Yuval; Technion IIT, Haifa 32000, Israel; эл. почта: lavuy@tx.technion.ac.il",,,14640325,,JEMOF,19216124.0,English,J.

The events are processed with the RCIs and ranked according the proposed methodology. The RCIs can be used either for (1) analysis of single events, (2) for comparison of events with similar characteristics, (3) for comparison of different energy technologies based on aggregated values, and (4) within Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to rank events and energy chains.

Among the possible accidental scenarios when cryogenic gas as liquefied natural gas (LNG) is spilled on water at a very fast rate, the phenomenon of rapid phase transition (RPT) may occur: large amounts of energy are released during phase transition which can generate explosions. The related consequences should be added to the possible consequences of fire in terms of flash fire, fireball, pool fire, and vapour cloud explosion for confined and congested geometry surrounding the release point. In this paper, the analysis of RPT of LNG has been studied from the point of view of blast wave production, through ab initio acoustic analysis for monopole source. Maximum overpressures, as calculated at the source point and along the blast pathway are compared with results of large scale experiments. Safety distances are given for the sake of comparison with threshold distances reported in the open literature. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A one-day Workshop was developed around tactical decision games (TDGs) for use by action teams, i.e. involving a team of multi-disciplinary experts, in the oil and gas drilling industry. Three TDGs were conducted to help team members to rehearse how they would respond to potential challenging situations, focusing in particular on team skills, such as decision making, situation awareness and communication. TDGs have previously been presented as a useful training technique to improve decision making and have been introduced in many high hazard industries [Crichton, M., Flin, R., Rattray, W.A., 2000. Training decision makers - tactical decision games. Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management 8(4), 208-217]. Building on TDGs for individuals, in a team-based TDG, team members discuss the scenario and reach a team-based solution, allowing team members to recognise the potential differing perspectives brought to the solution by team members from different disciplines. Specific team skills aspects raised during the TDG scenario were then generalised to the wider project, and their impact on overall team performance, safety, and effectiveness. Members of a deepwater exploration wells team (n = 30) attended the Workshop and reported that the use of TDGs in the Workshop was valuable in defining and illustrating team skills and their influence on team performance, and helping to prepare better for their forthcoming operations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM 2.5) were measured in kitchens using wood or natural gas (NG) in a semi-rural community in Pakistan. Daytime CO and PM2.5 levels were measured for eight continuous hours in 51 wood and 44 NG users from December 2005 to April 2006. The laser photometer PM2.5 (Dustrak, TSI) was calibrated for field conditions and PM2.5 measurements were reduced by a factor of 2.77. CO was measured by an electrochemical monitor (Model T15v, Langan). The arithmetic mean for daytime CO concentration was 29.4 ppm in wood users; significantly higher than 7.5 ppm in NG users (P &lt; 0.001). The arithmetic mean for daytime PM2.5 concentrations was 2.74 mg/m 3 in wood users; significantly higher than 0.38 mg/m3 in NG users (P &lt; 0.001). Higher peak levels of CO and PM2.5 were also observed in wood users. Time spent in the kitchen during fuel burning was significantly related to increasing CO and PM2.5 concentrations in wood users.

Fossil petroleum, natural gas, and coal reserves currently relied on are finite and nonrenewable, and their use has serious security, environmental, and economic consequences. Therefore, it is critical to develop renewable and sustainable alternative energy sources. Solar radiation is the only significant renewable and sustainable source of energy for the earth. This energy can be captured in plant material via photosynthesis and converted to liquid transportation fuel alternatives for petroleum-based gasoline and diesel. However, the resources required for producing biomass for energy are the same as those required to produce biomass for food, and this poses a fuel-versus-food conflict. Some feel the world’s land and water resources are sufficient to meet energy needs and also satisfy food and feed requirements. Others are concerned that use of food crops and of agricultural resources for energy are causing food shortages and starvation. It is critical that both energy and food be adequately provided, and fortunately, the world has great capacity to meet both needs. The challenge is to sustainably and efficiently manage that capacity, including agricultural and forestry resources, to effectively meet human needs. Agriculture has the potential to be a significant energy provider and in doing so bring vitality to rural communities. For a successful bioenergy program to be implemented, effective energy policy must be enacted, policy that encourages producers and users of energy and food to make choices and take actions that are in the best interest of humanity. © 2009 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,CRC Press,,9781420077544; 9781420077537,,,English,"Adequate Food for All: Culture, Science, and Technology of Food in the 21st Century",Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903331604

The aim of the study presented here was to assess the effects of ambient air pollution on daily mortality during a period of tremendous changes in air quality in the city of Erfurt, in eastern Germany, from October 1991 to March 2002. Data on particle size distributions were obtained from September 1995 to March 2002 at a research monitoring station. For particles from 0.01 microm to 2.5 microm in diameter, number concentrations (NCs)* and mass concentrations (MCs) were calculated. Particles with diameters less than or equal to 0.10 microm are defined as ultrafine particles (UFP). Data on the gaseous pollutants NO2, CO, SO2, and O3 and on PM10 (particulate matter [PM] with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 microm) were obtained from a government air-monitoring station. Data on changes in energy consumption, car fleet composition, and population were collected from local authorities. Death certificates of persons living in and dying in Erfurt were abstracted, and daily mortality counts were calculated. Poisson regression models were used to analyze the data, applying penalized splines (also known as P-splines) to model nonlinear relationships in the confounders. Model selection was done without air pollutants in the models, based on a combination of goodness-of-fit criteria and avoidance of autocorrelation in error terms. Final models included P-splines of time trend, meteorologic data, and influenza epidemics as well as day of the week with an indicator variable. Results are presented as change per interquartile range (IQR), i.e., change in the relative risk of mortality associated with a change in the concentration from the 25th to the 75th percentile of a given pollutant. Air pollutants were considered both as linear terms and as P-splines to assess the exposure-response functions. Changes in effect estimates over time were calculated using fully Bayesian time-varying coefficient models. This method was selected over four other approaches tested in simulation studies. Air-pollution concentrations decreased substantially in Erfurt during the decade under observation. The strongest changes were observed for SO2, for which annual concentrations decreased from 64 microg/m3 in 1992 to 4 microg/m3 in 2001. Concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microm), and CO decreased by more than 50%. NO2, O3, and ultrafine particles also decreased, though to a lesser extent. Based on visual inspection of the data on the changes in ambient air-pollution concentrations during the study period, we defined three study subperiods: A first subperiod from 1991 to 1995; a second, transitional subperiod from 1995 to 1998; and a third subperiod from 1998 to 2002. Generally, air-pollution concentrations decreased substantially from the first subperiod to the second, and some additional decreases occurred from the second subperiod to the third. During the second, transitional subperiod, natural gas replaced coal as the main energy source in Erfurt. In addition, the number of cars with catalytic converters increased over time, as did the number of cars in general. To facilitate the interpretation of the results, we organized the air pollutants into four groups: (1) NO2, CO, and ultrafine particles, (2) PM10 and PM2.5, (3) SO2, and (4) O3. We observed a 1.6% increased risk for daily mortality (CI, -0.4% to 3.5%) for an increase of 19.7 microg/m3 in NO2 (lag day 3), a 1.9% increased risk (CI, 0.2%-3.6%) for an increase of 0.48 mg/m3 in CO (lag day 4), and a 2.9% increased risk (CI, 0.3%-5.5%) for an increase of 9743/cm3 in ultrafine particles (lag day 4). No consistent associations were observed for PM10, PM2.5, or SO2. For O3, a 4.6% increased risk for daily mortality (CI, 1.1%-8.3%) was associated with a 43.8 microg/m3 maximum 8-hr concentration of O3 per day (lag day 2). For all four pollutants, exposure-response functions suggested no deviation from linearity. However, in time-varying models the strongest associations were observed for NO2, CO, and ultrafine particles during the transition subperiod, from 1995 to 1998, when O3 concentrations were lowest. Changes in source characteristics or ambient air-pollution concentrations were not able to explain these observations in a straightforward manner. However, the observations suggested that changes such as the introduction of three-way catalytic converters in cars and the substitution natural gas for coal might have been beneficial. Overall we concluded that: 1. Economic and political changes and the adoption of new technologies in eastern Germany resulted in distinct improvements in ambient air quality; 2. Urban air pollution in Erfurt changed within one decade from the eastern mixture toward that of western Europe (""western mixture""), which is dominated by concentrations of NOx, O3, fine particles, and ultrafine particles with low concentrations of SO2; 3. There was an association between daily mortality and ultrafine particles and combustion-related gases (lag days 3 or 4); 4. Ultrafine particles seemed to be the best pollution indicator and to point to the role of local combustion in the pollution mixture; 5. Regression coefficients showed variation over time for NO2, CO, ultrafine particles, and O3 that could not be explained by nonlinearity in the exposure-response functions; 6. Mortality associated with pollution was lower at the end of the 1990s than during the 1990s, except for mortality associated with O3; and 7. Mortality associated with pollution was strongest in the second, transitional subperiod, from 1995 to 1998, when changes in source characteristics had taken place but the benefits of improved ambient air quality had not yet been completely achieved.",,"air pollutant; article; death certificate; environmental monitoring; female; Germany; human; male; mortality; regression analysis; risk assessment; social class; statistical model; Air Pollutants; Death Certificates; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Models, Statistical; Mortality; Regression Analysis; Risk Assessment; Social Class","Peters, A.",,,10415505,,,19554968.0,English,Res Rep Health Eff Inst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67651209221

Here, we describe an approach that compares land disturbance between spatially compact and diffuse activities that contribute to the life cycle of a single product, in this case synthetic crude from Alberta's oil sands. We compare production using surface mining and in situ extraction technologies. In situ technologies disturb less land per unit of production than surface mining, but the spatial footprint of in situ production is more dispersed - increasing landscape fragmentation - and in situ production requires more natural gas which increases land use due to gas production. We examine both direct and peripheral land use of oil sands development by quantifying land disturbance using a parameterized measure of fragmentation that relies on 'edge effects' with an adjustable buffer zone. Using a life cycle perspective, we show that the land area influenced by in situ technology is comparable to land disturbed by surface mining when fragmentation and upstream natural gas production are considered. The results suggest that land disturbance due to natural gas production can be relatively large per unit energy. This method could be applied to other energy developments, for example, a comparison between coal mining and natural gas production when both fuels are used to generate electricity. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Land use; Mining; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Oil sands; Energy development; Generate electricity; In-situ extractions; In-situ production; Landscape fragmentation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle perspectives; Natural-gas production; Life cycle,"Keith, D.

The flame can amplify fluctuations in the released heat, and thus in the acoustic field as well. The induced pressure oscillations will drive vibrations of the combustor walls and burner parts. Stronger fluctuating pressure results in stronger fluctuations in the wall structure. Due to fatigue the remaining life time of the hardware will be reduced significantly. This paper investigates the modeling of acoustic oscillations and mechanical vibrations induced by turbulent lean premixed natural gas combustion. The mutual interaction of the combustion processes, induced oscillating pressure field in the combustion chamber, and induced vibration of the liner walls are investigated with numerical techniques. A partitioned procedure is used here: CFX-11 for the CFD analysis and Ansys-11 for the CSD analysis are coupled to give insight into a correlation between acoustic pressure oscillations and liner vibrations.

The description of this fluctuating heat release and its effect on acoustics in turbulent flames is complicated due to the interaction of chemical reactions with turbulence, mixing and pressure fluctuations. In a turbulent flame the instantaneous density, velocity, pressure, temperature and species concentrations are determined by the transport equations for mass, momentum, enthalpy and species and by the equation of state. In this paper an equation is formulated that describes the propagation of acoustic pressure fluctuations, and that determines the source terms. Subsequently events are ordered on basis of their typical time scale. That way source terms can be evaluated for the situation where the combustion is described with the use of time averaged chemical reaction progress variables and a mixture fraction variable. Subsequently the consequences of Reynolds and Favre averaging on these source terms and conservation of acoustical variables in a domain with turbulent flow are discussed. The use of the reaction progress variables, as a basis for acoustic propagation prediction, in a Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes flow calculation, is demonstrated on a premixed turbulent natural gas flame with finite combustion kinetics.",,Acoustic pressures; Acoustic propagation; Combustion kinetics; Natural gas flames; Pressure fluctuation; Reynolds - Averaged Navier-Stokes; Species concentration; Transport equation; Acoustic noise; Equations of state; Navier Stokes equations; Reaction kinetics; Combustion,"Kok, J.B.W.; University of Twente, P.O.

Researchers linked the results of the air-monitoring analysis to individual animals for the relevant month. For the 205 herds examined at pregnancy testing in 2001, monthly mean exposures on the basis of all available data were as follows: sulfur dioxide, geometric mean (GM) = 0.5 ppb, geometric standard deviation (GSD) = 2.2; hydrogen sulfide, GM = 0.14 ppb, GSD = 2.3; benzene, GM = 0.247 μg/m3, GSD = 2.5; and toluene, GM = 0.236 μg/m3, GSD = 2.7.

Beef cows also have the greatest opportunity for direct contact with their environment through continuous sampling of the air, water, vegetation, and soil. These factors combine to make cow-calf herds a potentially useful sentinel of environmental change. Researchers individually tracked more than 33,000 cows in 205 beef cow-calf herds from spring 2001 to the end of the calving season in 2002 to examine the potential effects of emissions from the oil and gas industry on productivity. This article describes the study design and methodology of the Western Canada Study, with emphasis on herd-selection criteria and study implementation, the collection of herd-production data, and the challenges of tracking individual animals in a large prospective observational study-as the Western Canada Study is the largest on-farm study of its kind in North American cow-calf herds to date. The primary objective of this project was to examine the potential association between reproductive success and cumulative chronic exposure to sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and volatile organic compounds in beef herds. Herd-selection criteria included potential exposure to oil and gas facilities, herd size, quality of available records, an established relationship with a local veterinary clinic, and participant interest. With the cooperation of local herd owners and veterinarians, on-farm collection of detailed individual animal data was successful in this group of cow-calf operations. Of the 212 herds initially selected to participate, complete calving season data for 2002 were available for 203 herds (96%). Individual animal records were available for more than 98% of eligible cows for each measurement period throughout the study. Herd-production records were rated as satisfactory or better in 94% of the herds. These process outcomes confirm the practicality of using cow-calf herds as sentinel populations for environmental exposures and support the validity of subsequent research on these animal populations. © 2008 Heldref Publications.",Battery; Beef cows; Cattle; Gas-processing plant; Oil and gas well; Upstream oil and gas field facility,hydrogen sulfide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; fossil fuel; fuel oil; hydrogen sulfide; petroleum; volatile organic compound; animal health; article; calf (bovine); Canada; controlled study; cow; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental management; herd; nonhuman; observational study; oil industry; priority journal; reproduction; agriculture; animal; animal disease; animal husbandry; cattle; cattle disease; chemically induced disorder; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; female; human; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prospective study; risk factor; Animalia; Bos; Agriculture; Alberta; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Fossil Fuels; Fuel Oils; Humans; Hydrogen Sulfide; Petroleum; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Volatile Organic Compounds,"Waldner, C.; Department of Large Animal Clinical Studies, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B4, Canada; эл. почта: cheryl.waldner@usask.ca",,Taylor and Francis Inc.,19338244,,,19106062.0,English,Archiv.

Current methods of hydrogen production are based on conventional fossil fuels like natural gas, petroleum and coal. These methods are energy-expensive and cause environmental pollution. This is the reason behind the great interest in hydrogen production from biomass by microorganisms under anaerobic conditions. This direction seems to be very attractive because biomass is a versatile and renewable energy source and can be a method of utilization of various organic wastes. The article presents known biological processes leading to hydrogen production: dark fermentation, photofermentation, direct and indirect biophotolysis, anaerobic respiration of sulphate-reducing bacteria under conditions of sulphate depletion. Dark fermentation and dark fermentation followed by photofermentation seem to be the most promising concepts for the future applications. Many investigations now are focused on improving the yield of hydrogen during fermentation. Molecular techniques like the analysis of 16S rRNA gene or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are employed to identify and isolate new species of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Hydrogenases are key enzymes responsible for hydrogen evolution in all of the known biological processes. They are metalloenzymes carring out a simple chemical reaction: 2H + + 2e - ↔ H 2. In anaerobic hydrogen-producing eukaryotic microorganisms hydrogenases are usually located in special organella - hydrogenosomes. Hydrogenosomes are an adaptation to anaerobic conditions and become energetic centers of the cell. Microorganisms responsible for hydrogen production in rumen, a specific fermentative chamber, are also described.",Biomass; Fermentation; Fotoproduktion; Hydrogen; Hydrogenases,,"Sikora, A.; Instytut Biochemii I Biofizyki PAN, ul.

Inventory estimates for the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants like CO2, CO, NOx, and volatile organic compound from transport sector in Delhi, has been developed using bottom up approach provided by Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC-1996). The impacts of policy option in transport sector like introduction of Compressed Natural Gas for public transport in Delhi and introduction of Euro-1 norms for vehicles have also been estimated. The emission inventory reveals that total emission of pollutants from different categories vehicles have increased during the period 1990-2000. For example, the CO2 emission (1000, tones) from gasoline driven vehicle (MC/SC) in Delhi has increased from 766 in 1990-91 to 1187 in 1999-00. The diesel driven vehicles Light commercial vehicles in Delhi has contributed to 577 CO2 in 1990-91, which increased to 9779 in 1999-00. For other pollutants also, which have been estimated here, an increase in total emission from gasoline and diesel driven vehicles has been observed during this 1990-2000 periods. This study shows that the over all contribution of pollutants in the total emissions from gasoline and diesel driven vehicles have increased in Delhi during this period. The present study also shows that the implementation of Euro-1 in 2000 in Delhi has resulted in the decrease of total emission of CO, HC, NOx, and volatile organic compound for all the classes of vehicle for which the revised vehicle emissions norms were implemented. However this decrease in emission has become inefficient due to increase in vehicle population.",Emission; Green house gases; Inventory,bottom-up approach; carbon emission; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; public transport; traffic emission; volatile organic compound; Asia; Delhi; Eurasia; India; South Asia,"Pundir, R.; Radio and Atmospheric Science Division, , New Delhi, India; эл. почта: reenaspundir@yahoo.com",,,17351979,,,,English,Iran.

Incidence density of coughing, wheezing and breathing difficulty was assessed by referring to daily records of symptoms and child's medication. The association between exposure to pollutants and occurrence of symptoms was evaluated using mixed-effect models with binary response and poisson regression.Results: Wheezing was found to relate significantly to air pollutants: an increase of 17.4 μg/m3(IQR) of PM2.5(24-h average) was associated with an 8.8% increase (95% CI: 2.4% to 15.5%); an increase of 34 ppb (IQR) of NO2(1-h maximum) was associated with an 9.1% increase (95% CI: 2.3% to16.4%) and an increase of 48 ppb (IQR) in O3levels (1 hr maximum) to an increase of 10% (95% CI: 3.2% to 17.3%).

Along with water, the cometary nucleus contains ices of natural gases (CH4, C2H6), alcohols (CH3OH), acids (HCOOH), embalming fluid (H2CO), and even anti-freeze (ethylene glycol). Comets today contain some ices that vaporize at temperatures near absolute zero (CO, CH4), demonstrating that their compositions remain largely unchanged after 4.5 billion years. By comparing their chemical diversity, several distinct cometary classes have been identified but their specific relation to chemical gradients in the proto-planetary disk remains murky. How does the compositional diversity of comets relate to nebular processes such as chemical processing, radial migration, and dynamical scattering? No current reservoir holds a unique class, but their fractional abundance can test emerging dynamical models for origins of the scattered Kuiper disk, the Oort cloud, and the (proposed) main-belt comets.

In Chinese urban environments, coal gas and natural gas are used as the main fuels for cooking. Analysis of the results employed the ratio of living room to kitchen (L/K) pollutant concentrations and the correlation of their levels to assess the transport of pollutants indoors. Sources in the kitchen affect living room concentrations of SO2, NO, NO2, and CO, less so that of CO2 levels and weakly of PM10. Among all the pollutants, SO2 has the minimum 0.88 L/K ratio value, and maximum correlation value, R2=0.89; on the other hand, PM10 has the maximum L/K ratio value, 1.20 and minimum R 2-value, 0.55, which means that PM 10 is mostly influenced by activities and other factors that do not take place in the kitchen. Concentrations of SO2 differed significantly depending on the fuel type used for cooking with coal gas producing 87.6% higher SO2 concentrations than natural gas. Concentrations of CO2 and PM10 were the same regardless of gas type. The type of ventilation was found to influence polluant concentrations with a mechanical exhaust system showing higher efficiency than a natural ventilation system in exhausting pollutants. The period and style of cooking also affected concentrations of pollutants in the kitchen. © SAGE Publications 2008.",Coal gas; Indoor pollutant; Kitchen; L/K ratio; Natural gas; Residences,carbon dioxide; fuel; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; sulfide; air quality; article; China; climate change; exhaust gas; gas; indoor air pollution; kitchen; priority journal; urban area,"Zhang, G.; College of Civil Engineering, , Changsha, Hunan, 410082, China; эл. почта: gqzhang@188.com",,,1420326X,,IBENF,,English,Indoor Built Environ.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48249108356

Previous research by the authors found evidence that up to 10% of particular household categories may be exposed to elevated carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations from poor quality gas appliance installations. The literature suggests certain neurological symptoms are linked to exposure to low levels of CO. This paper addresses the hypothesis that certain self-reported neurological symptoms experienced by a householder are linked to an estimate of their CO exposure. Methods. Between 27 April and 27 June 2006, 597 homes with a mains supply of natural gas were surveyed, mainly in old, urban areas of London. Qualified gas engineers tested all gas appliances (cooker, boiler, gas fire, and water heater) and reported, according to the Gas Industry Unsafe Situations Procedure, appliances considered At Risk (AR), Immediately Dangerous (ID) or Not to Current Standards (NCS). Five exposure risk categories were defined based on measurement of CO emitted by the appliance, its features and its use, with ""high or very high"" exposure category where occupants were considered likely to be exposed to levels greater than 26 ppm for one hour. The prevalence of symptoms at each level of exposure was compared with that at lowest level of exposure. Results. Of the households, 6% were assessed as having a ""high or very high"" risk of exposure to CO. Of the individuals, 9% reported at least one neurological symptom. There was a statistically significant association between ""high or very high"" exposure risk to CO and self-reported symptoms compared to ""no exposure"" likelihood, for households not in receipt of benefit, controlling for ""number of residents"" and presence of pensioners, OR = 3.23 (95%CI: 1.28, 8.15). Risk ratios across all categories of exposure likelihood indicate a dose-response pattern. Those households in receipt of benefit showed no dose-response pattern. Conclusion. This study found an association between risk of CO exposure at low concentration, and prevalence of self-reported neurological symptoms in the community for those households not in receipt of benefit. As health status was self-reported, this association requires further investigation. © 2008 Croxford et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,carbon monoxide; natural gas; carbon monoxide; fossil fuel; ambient air; article; boiler; carbon monoxide intoxication; clinical feature; environmental exposure; flue gas; health survey; household; human; indoor air pollution; kitchen; major clinical study; prevalence; risk assessment; self report; United Kingdom; cross-sectional study; equipment; neurologic disease; pathophysiology; risk; statistical model; United Kingdom; Carbon Monoxide; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Equipment Failure; Fossil Fuels; Household Articles; Humans; Logistic Models; London; Nervous System Diseases; Odds Ratio; Risk Assessment,"Croxford, B.; Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, 1-19 Torrington Place, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom; эл. почта: b.croxford@ucl.ac.uk",,,1476069X,,,18593476.0,English,Environ.

Previous studies have not characterized particle exposure through time-activity diaries or personal monitoring in mainland China. Objectives: In this study we charactedized indoor and personal particle exposure in six households in northeastern China (three urban, three rural) and explored differences by location, cooking status, activity, and fuel type. Rural homes used biomass. Urban homes used a combination of electricity and natural gas. Methods: Stationary monitors measured hourly indoor particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 pm (PM10) for rural and urban kitchens, urban sitting rooms, and outdoors. Personal monitors for PM with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μ (PM2.5) were employed for 10 participants. Time-activity partterns in 30-min intervals were recorded by researchers for each participant. Results: Stationary monitoring results indicate that rural kitchen PM10 levels are three times higher than those in urban kitchens during cooking. PM10 was 6.1 times higher during cooking periods than during noncooking periods for rural kitchens. Personal PM2.5 levels for rural cooks were 2.8-3.6 times higher than for all other participant categories. The highest PM2.5 exposures occurred during cooking periods for urban and rural cooks. However, rural cooks had 5.4 times higher PM2.5 levels during cooking thin did urban cooks. Rural cooks spent 2.5 times more hours per day cooking than did their urban counterparts. Conclusions: These findings, indicate that biomass burning for cooking contributes substantially to indoor particulate levels and that this exposure is particularly elevated for cooks.

Objectives: We studied the risk of low birth weight (LBW) and reduced mean birth weight in relation to reported use of wood for cooking during the prenatal period, compared with natural gas (NG). Methods: We studied a historical cohort of women who had a singleton live birth in the years 2000-2002, from a semirural area of Pakistan. Infants birth weight was obtained from records, and prenatal records had data for maternal body mass index and parity. Cooking habits, daytime sleep habits, and type of fuel used during the pregnancies in 2000-2002 were ascertained by a survey done in 2004-2005. We performed multiple linear and logistic regression modeling using propensity scores to adjust for confounding variables. Results: Unadjusted mean (± SD) birth weight was 2.78 ± 0.45 kg in wood users, and 2.84 ± 0.43 kg (p < 0.06) in NG users. Infants born to wood users averaged 82 g lighter than infants born to NG users when weight was adjusted for confounders (p < 0.07). The rate of LBW (< 2,500 g) was 22.7% among wood users compared with 15.0% in NG users (p < 0.01), for an adjusted relative risk of 1.64 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.34). The population attributable risk for LBW explained by wood use was estimated to be 24%. Conclusion: Cooking with wood fuel during pregnancy, a potentially modifiable exposure, was associated with LBW and marginally lower mean birth weight compared with using NG.",Birth weight; Cooking habits; Historical cohort; Natural gas; Pregnancy; Propensity scores,"fuel; natural gas; adolescent; adult; article; attributable risk; body mass; cohort analysis; confidence interval; confounding variable; controlled study; cooking; environmental exposure; female; health survey; human; live birth; logistic regression analysis; low birth weight; multiple linear regression analysis; Pakistan; parity; prenatal exposure; preschool child; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; rural area; scoring system; sleep pattern; smoke; wood; Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollutants; Body Mass Index; Cookery; Female; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Exposure; Middle Aged; Pakistan; Parity; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Risk; Smoke; Wood; Young Adult","Siddiqui, A.R.; Department of Community Health Sciences, P.O.

These have included nano-Ag, Al2O3, TiO2, Fe 2O3, ZrO2, Si3N4, chrysotile asbestos, BC, 2 types of MWCNT-aggregate PM (MWCNT-R and MWCNT-N), and high-volume glass fiber collected soots: candle, wood, diesel (truck), tire, and 3-types of natural gas kitchen burner-generated soots: yellow (fuel-rich) flame, low-flow blue flame, and normal flow blue flame soot PM. These carbonaceous nano-PM species can be found in either the indoor and outdoor environments or microenvironments. Two-day and two-week in-vitro cultures of A549 showed cell death (or decreased cell viability) for all nanoparticulate materials, but especially significant for all but the TiO2 and candle, wood, and diesel PM. The natural gas kitchen burner combustion PM cell death response was characteristic of BC and MWCNT PM. There was no correlation with total PAH content of the soot PM. Cytokine release (IL-6, IL-8) was detected for the Ag, Fe2 O3, asbestos, BC and the MWCNT PM. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was also detected for Ag, Fe 2 O3, ZrO2, asbestos, BC, and the MWCNT aggregate PM, as well as the natural gas kitchen burner combustion PM. TEM, FESEM, and optical microscopy examination of these nanomaterials illustrate the wide range in PM morphologies and crystallinities as well as cell morphologies.

Methods Three studies were carried out: the burden of respiratory disease was evaluated (acute lower respiratory infection-ALRI and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD), disease costs were studied and the cost effectiveness of natural gas was analysed in terms of reducing indoor air pollution. Results Without natural gas in these localities, it would be expected that 498 (477- 560) cases of ALRI per year would lead to 149 (119-196) hospitalisations, 6 (4-10) deaths and 7 291 (5,746-9,696) disability adjusted life years (DALY) annually. Furthermore, it is expected that 459 (372-684) cases of COPD per year would lead to 138 (93-239), hospitalisations, 11 deaths (5-26) and 1 500 (973-2 711) DALY annually. Annual disease burden cost was 5,2 (3,8-8,3) million dollars before installing domiciliary natural gas (DNG); most of such cost arose from COPD (around 85 %). ARI and COPD costs after installing DNG would rise to 3,5 (2,5-5,7) million dollars; avoided costs would be 1,6 (1,2-2,6) million dollars, (30 % of disease burden cost without DNG). The incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) of installing DNG would be 56 (22-74) thousand dollars per life saved and ICER per DALY saved would be 43-66 dollars. Conclusion DNG is a sanitary technology which reduces the burden of indoor air pollution-associated respiratory diseases arising from burning biomass fuel in rural localities in a cost-effective way.",COPD; Cost effectiveness; Natural gas,"fossil fuel; acute disease; aged; article; Central America; chronic obstructive lung disease; Colombia; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; cost of illness; economics; evaluation; female; human; indoor air pollution; infant; male; middle aged; mortality; pneumonia; preschool child; rural population; statistical analysis; Acute Disease; Aged; Air Pollution, Indoor; Caribbean Region; Child, Preschool; Colombia; Cost of Illness; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Female; Fossil Fuels; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Rural Population",,,Universidad Nacional de Colombia,01240064,,,19360204.0,English; Spanish,Rev.

Material and Methods: ATSDR, as the coordinator of the HSEES system, determined the kind and scope of data to be collected. In Poland, the fire department's reports were the main source of information on chemical emergencies. Results: In 2005, as many as 245 incidents of chemical release and 23 of threatened release were recorded. Most of acute chemical incidents were associated with transportation and warehousing (106; 39.6%); in this truck transportation accounted for almost 50%, and the chemical and food sector for a little more than 50% of the total incidents. Human error and equipment failure were the primary causal factors, contributing respectively to 147 (54.9%) and 103 (38.4%) incidents. The chemicals involved most frequently were mercury (21.4%), propane-butane mixture (9.7%), ammonia (7.1%), hydrochloric acid, natural gas, sulfuric acid (5.2-5.6%) and nitric acid (5.2%). Out of 268 emergencies, 43 (16.0%) involved casualties: 191 in total, including 180 (94.2%) in the fixed facility incidents and 11 (5.8%) in the transportation-related incidents. The largest group of casualties were students (97) followed by employees (62). The most common injury related to chemical emergency was respiratory irritation (142; 74.3%).

Significantly large VOC emission sources impact the air quality in Corpus Christi, Texas. This urban area is located in a semi-arid region of South Texas and is home to several large petrochemical refineries and industrial facilities along a busy ship-channel. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has setup two continuous ambient monitoring stations (CAMS 633 and 634) along the ship channel to monitor VOC concentrations in the urban atmosphere. The hourly concentrations of 46 VOC compounds were acquired from TCEQ for a comprehensive source apportionment study. The primary objective of this study was to identify and quantify the sources affecting the ambient air quality within this urban airshed. Principal Component Analysis/Absolute Principal Component Scores (PCA/APCS) was applied to the dataset. PCA identified five possible sources accounting for 69% of the total variance affecting the VOC levels measured at CAMS 633 and six possible sources affecting CAMS 634 accounting for 75% of the total variance. APCS identified natural gas emissions to be the major source contributor at CAMS 633 and it accounted for 70% of the measured VOC concentrations. The other major sources identified at CAMS 633 included flare emissions (12%), fugitive gasoline emissions (9%), refinery operations (7%), and vehicle exhaust (2%). At CAMS 634, natural gas sources were identified as the major source category contributing to 31% of the observed VOC.

Substantial temporal and spatial variability was observed in all seasons and attributed, in part, to the batch nature of operations, process emission variability and frequent work interruptions. The need for fine mapping grids was demonstrated, where elevations in particle concentrations were highly localized. Ultrafine particle concentrations were generally greatest during winter when incoming make-up air was heated with direct fire, natural gas burners. Make-up air drawn from roof level had elevated respirable mass and ultrafine number concentrations above ambient outdoor levels, suggesting inadvertent recirculation of foundry process emissions. Elevated respirable mass concentrations were highly localized on occasions (e.g. abrasive blasting and grinding), depended on the area within the facility where measurements were obtained, but were largely unaffected by season. Particle sources were further characterized by measuring their respective number and mass concentrations by particle size. Sources that contributed to ultrafine particles included process-specific sources (e.g. melting and pouring operations), and non-process sources (e.g. direct fire natural gas heating units, a liquid propane-fuelled sweeper and cigarette smoking) were additionally identified. 2008 © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Occupational Hygiene Society.",,"Air pollution; Automotive industry; Climate change; Concentration (process); Iron foundry practice; Natural gas; Foundries; Mapping; Natural gas; Mapping grids; Particle concentrations; Process emission; Spatial variability; Particles (particulate matter); Particle size; cigarette smoke; iron; air pollution; article; chemical industry; gravimetry; grinding; melting point; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Iron; Metallurgy; Occupational Exposure; Particle Size; Seasons; Mass concentration; Number concentration; Particle concentrations; Respirable mass concentrations; Respirable particles; Temporal and spatial variability; Ultrafine particle; Ultrafine particle number","Heitbrink, W.A.; Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, , Iowa City, IA 52242-5000, United States; эл. почта: william-heitbrink@uiowa.edu",,,00034878,,AOHYA,18056626.0,English,Ann.

Oil and natural gas companies are actively pursuing innovative research and new technology initiatives to answer the technical and policy questions surrounding CCS. This paper presents an overview of a recent collaborative effort between the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) and the American Petroleum Institute (API) to develop guidelines for accounting and reporting of GHG emission reductions from CCS projects.The focus of the CCS guidelines is on specific technical considerations and the assessment of project emission reductions over the entire CCS chain - capture, transport, injection and storage. The guidelines address potential baseline candidates and scenario assessment, potential emission sources, and monitoring considerations. Case studies for three potential applications are provided to demonstrate the application of emission reduction principles. Key messages include: bull; Growing industry experience with CCS can be used to develop an overall approach to managing geological storage and reducing the risk of unintended physical leakage. Comprehensive examination of possible sites, with appropriate site selection for geological storage, as well as operation and monitoring, are all components of a risk management approach. • Good practices in monitoring are especially important for CCS to be a safe and secure GHG emission reduction option. • Monitoring should be based on a site-specific risk assessment, with monitoring methods appropriate for the identified risks and to assure the long-term environmental integrity of the storage. Oil industry experience and expertise provide confidence in CCS as an effective emissions mitigation option. Through these guidelines, API and IPIECA aim to assist the petroleum industry in identifying, assessing, and developing CCS projects with the potential for producing credible GHG emission reductions.Copyright 2007, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,American petroleum institutes; Base-lines; Carbon captures; Case studies; Ccs projects; Collaborative efforts; Comprehensive examinations; Emission reductions; Emission sources; Emissions mitigations; Environmental conservations; Environmental integrities; Gas companies; Geological storages; Ghg emissions; Good practices; Greenhouse gasses; Industry experiences; Industry guidelines; Innovative researches; Key messages; Monitoring methods; New technologies; Oil industries; Potential applications; Scenario assessments; Technical considerations; Conservation; Distributed computer systems; Emission control; Engineers; Exhibitions; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Leakage (fluid); Petroleum refineries; Petroleum transportation; Public utilities; Reduction; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Site selection; Petroleum industry,"Siveter, R.; IPIECA",,,,9781604239775,,,English,"Soc.

China is the largest coal producer and consumer in the world (Finkelman 1995). It has been estimated that more than 75% of the energy production in China is based on coal (Chen et al. 2004), and more than 400 million people in China rely on coal for their domestic energy needs, such as heating and daily cooking.

Comparison of different forms of commercial power generation by use of the fuel cycle methods developed in European studies shows the health burdens to be greatest for power stations that most pollute outdoor air (those based on lignite, coal, and oil). The health burdens are appreciably smaller for generation from natural gas, and lower still for nuclear power. This same ranking also applies in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions and thus, potentially, to long-term health, social, and economic effects arising from climate change. Nuclear power remains controversial, however, because of public concern about storage of nuclear waste, the potential for catastrophic accident or terrorist attack, and the diversion of fissionable material for weapons production. Health risks are smaller for nuclear fusion, but commercial exploitation will not be achieved in time to help the crucial near-term reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. The negative effects on health of electricity generation from renewable sources have not been assessed as fully as those from conventional sources, but for solar, wind, and wave power, such effects seem to be small; those of biofuels depend on the type of fuel and the mode of combustion. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage is increasingly being considered for reduction of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel plants, but the health effects associated with this technology are largely unquantified and probably mixed: efficiency losses mean greater consumption of the primary fuel and accompanying increases in some waste products.

Ultrafine particle (UFP) exposures are of particular concern owing to their enhanced ability to cause oxidative stress and inflammation in the lungs. In this investigation, our objective was to examine the contribution of home heating systems (electric baseboard heaters, wood stoves, forced-air oil/natural gas furnace) to indoor UFP exposures. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 36 homes in the cities of Montréal, Québec, and Pembroke, Ontario. Real-time measures of indoor UFP concentrations were collected in each home for approximately 14 h, and an outdoor UFP measurement was collected outside each home before indoor sampling. A home-characteristic questionnaire was also administered, and air exchange rates were estimated using carbon dioxide as a tracer gas. Average UFP exposures of 21,594 cm-3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 14,014, 29,174) and 6660 cm-3 (95% CI: 4339, 8982) were observed for the evening (1600-2400) and overnight (2400-0800) hours, respectively. In an unadjusted comparison, overnight baseline UFP exposures were significantly greater in homes with electric baseboard heaters as compared to homes using forced-air oil or natural gas furnaces, and homes using wood stoves had significantly greater overnight baseline UFP exposures than homes using forced-air natural gas furnaces. However, in multivariate models, electric oven use (β=12,253 cm-3, 95% CI: 3524, 20,982), indoor relative humidity (β=1136 cm-3 %, 95% CI: 372, 1899), and indoor smoking (β=18,192 cm-3, 95% CI: 2073, 34,311) were the only significant determinants of mean indoor UFP exposure, whereas air exchange rate (β=4351 cm-3 h-1, 95% CI: 1507, 7195) and each 10,000 cm -3 increase in outdoor UFPs (β=811 cm-3, 95% CI: 244,1377) were the only significant determinants of overnight baseline UFP exposures. In general, our findings suggest that home heating systems are not important determinants of indoor UFP exposures. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",Exposure assessment; Indoor air quality; Indoor particle sources; Ultrafine particles,"adult; air conditioning; air quality; air sampling; article; Canada; cross-sectional study; health survey; heat; human; humidity; indoor air pollution; multivariate analysis; particle size; particulate matter; questionnaire; winter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Canada; Data Collection; Environmental Monitoring; Heating; Housing; Humans; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Ventilation","Weichenthal, S.; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, 3450 University Street, Montréal, Que.

A condensation particle counter (CPC) was used to measure particle number concentrations in the 0.01 μm to 1 μm range, and an optical particle counter (OPC) was used to measure particle number concentrations in 15 channels between 0.3 μm and 20 μm. The OPC measurements were used to estimate the respirable mass concentration. Very fine particle number concentrations were estimated by subtracting the OPC particle number concentrations from 0.3 μm to 1 μm from the CPC number concentrations. At specific locations during the summer visit, an electrical low pressure impactor was used to measure particle size distribution from 0.07 μm to 10 μm in 12 channels. The geometric mean ratio of respirable mass concentration estimated from the OPC to the gravimetrically measured mass concentration was 0.66 with a geometric standard deviation of 1.5. Very fine particle number concentrations in winter were substantially greater where direct-fire natural gas heaters were operated (7.5 × 105 particles/cm3) than where steam was used for heat (3 × 105 particles/cm3). During summer when heaters were off, the very fine particle number concentrations were below 105 particles/cm3, regardless of location. Elevated very fine particle number concentrations were associated with machining operations with poor enclosures. Whereas respirable mass concentrations did not vary noticeably with season, they were greater in areas with poorly fitting enclosures (0.12 mg/m3) than in areas where state-of-the-art enclosures were used (0.03 mg/m3). These differences were attributed to metalworking fluid mist that escaped from poorly fitting enclosures. Particles generated from direct-fire natural gas heater operation were very small, with a number size distribution modal diameter of less than 0.023 μm. Aerosols generated by machining operations had number size distributions modes in the 0.023 μm to 0.1 μm range. However, multiple modes in the mass size distributions estimated from OPC measurements occurred in the 2-20 μm range. Although elevated, very fine particle concentrations and respirable mass concentrations were both associated with poorly enclosed machining operations; the operation of the direct-fire natural gas heaters resulted in the greatest very fine particle concentrations without elevating the respirable mass concentration. These results suggest that respirable mass concentration may not be an adequate indicator for very fine particle exposure.",Aerosol; Combustion aerosol; Engine plant; Machining; Metalworking fluid; Ultra fine aerosol,"aerosol; air pollutant; article; car; chemistry; comparative study; environmental monitoring; exposure; heating; human; methodology; occupational exposure; particle size; season; Aerosols; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Automobiles; Environmental Monitoring; Heating; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Occupational Exposure; Particle Size; Seasons","Heitbrink, W.A.; Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, , Iowa City, IA 52242-5000, United States; эл. почта: william-heitbrink@uiowa.edu",,,15459624,,JOEHA,17454502.0,English,J.

Virtually all of the ethanol used for transportation has been produced from corn. During the period of fuel ethanol growth, corn farming productivity has increased dramatically, and energy use in ethanol plants has been reduced by almost by half. The majority of corn ethanol plants are powered by natural gas. However, as natural gas prices have skyrocketed over the last several years, efforts have been made to further reduce the energy used in ethanol plants or to switch from natural gas to other fuels, such as coal and wood chips. In this paper, we examine nine corn ethanol plant types - categorized according to the type of process fuels employed, use of combined heat and power, and production of wet distiller grains and solubles. We found that these ethanol plant types can have distinctly different energy and greenhouse gas emission effects on a full fuel-cycle basis. In particular, greenhouse gas emission impacts can vary significantly - from a 3% increase if coal is the process fuel to a 52% reduction if wood chips are used. Our results show that, in order to achieve energy and greenhouse gas emission benefits, researchers need to closely examine and differentiate among the types of plants used to produce corn ethanol so that corn ethanol production would move towards a more sustainable path. © IOP Publishing Ltd.",Corn ethanol; Ethanol plants; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life-cycle analysis,Cogeneration plants; Ethanol; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Wood products; Combined heat and power; Corn-ethanol; Distiller grain; Ethanol plants; Fuel ethanol; Life cycle analysis; Natural gas price; Transportation fuels; Ethanol fuels,"Wang, M.; Center for Transportation Research, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 South Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60565, United States; эл. почта: mqwang@anl.gov",,Institute of Physics Publishing,17489326,,,,English,Environ.Res.Lett.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547629220

Concern is increasing that use of polluting heating and cooking sources can increase cancer risk. In Canada, most cooking and heating currently relies on electricity or natural gas, but, in the past, and still in some areas, coal and wood stoves were used for heating and gas and wood for cooking. In the course of a case-control study of lung cancer carried out in Montreal in 1996-2001, the authors collected information on subjects' lifetime exposure to such sources of domestic pollution by means of a personal interview with the subject or a next-of-kin proxy. Questionnaires were completed for 739 male cases, 925 male controls, 466 female cases, and 616 female controls. Odds ratios were computed in relation to a few indices of exposure to traditional heating and cooking sources, adjusting for a number of covariates, including smoking. Among men, there was no indication of excess risks. Among women, the odds ratio for those exposed to both traditional heating and cooking sources was 2.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.5, 3.6; n = 253). The findings for women suggest the need for research dedicated to exploring this association, with particular emphasis on improved exposure assessment.

Concerning the replacement of sulfur-containing by sulfur-free odorization, the availability of a fast and sensitive detection method that can, further, be used on-site plays a key role. The minimum concentration of the new sulfur-free odorant Gasodor™ S-Free™ (S-Free) in natural gas should be added at a level of at least 8.8 mg m -3 to assure a significant warning smell. Therefore, a dynamic range between 0 and approx. 25 mg m-3 must be realised in the rather complex matrix of natural gas. By means of a handheld ion mobility spectrometer, the odorant content in natural gas is determined within less than 80 s total analysis time directly at the gas pipe. The concentration of S-Free is monitored between 4 and 23 mg m-3 respecting the quality of the natural gas (high- and low-caloric gas).

However, recovery of other metals in spent absorbents has not been widely explored or considered during the waste treatment process. For this reason, this study on the management of these wastes was conducted to ensure environmentally sound company operations, cost effectiveness and sustainable development. Mercury and hydrogen sulfide absorbents were firstly applied in the natural gas purification process of PTT Exploration & Production Co. Ltd. at the Bongkot Production Platform to remove mercury and hydrogen sulfide absorbents in November 2005. After their use, service, spent absorbents were discharged from mercury the removal unit (MRU) and Sour Gas Recovery Unit (SRU) and transferred to storage at the company's onshore supply base before their appropriate disposal. Information gathered from material data sheets indicated the possibility of worthwhile metal recovery from the spent absorbents. Moreover, waste sampling and laboratory analyses were also conducted to gain a full understanding of waste's characteristics. Some specific parameters were employed in waste classification. Mercury, copper, zinc and sulfide were analyzed for both Total Threshold Limit Concentration (TTLC) and Soluble Threshold Limit Concentration (STLC). Besides, potential recoverable metals e.g. copper and zinc were analyzed. Local and international legislation were also reviewed to help make any final decisions regard the most appropriate waste treatment technology. It was recommended that high mercury spent absorbents be retorted and roasted to remove the mercury before its transfer to a recovery plant for copper or zinc recovery. It was furthermore decided that low mercury absorbent should be sent to a metal recovery plant directly without any treatment. As a result of this study, it was found that, with proper waste management, metal recovery from spent absorbents could provide considerable financial and environmental while also reducing, especially in terms of reducing disposal cost.

The study was conducted at the Woolloongabba Busway station in Brisbane, Australia in the winter months of 2002 during which temperature inversions frequently occurred. Most buses that utilize the station are fuelled by diesel, the exhaust of which contains a significant quantity of particle matter. Passengers waiting at the station are exposed to these particles emitted from the buses. During the course of this study, passenger census was conducted, based on video surveillance, yielding person-by-person waiting time data. Furthermore, a bus census revealed accurate information about the total number of diesel versus Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) powered buses. Background (outside of the bus station) and platform measurements of ultrafine particulate number size distributions were made to determine ambient aerosol concentrations. Particle number exposure concentration ranges from 10 and 40 to 60% of bus related exhaust fumes. This changes dramatically when considering the particle mass exposure concentration, where most passengers are exposed to about 50 to 80% of exhaust fumes. The obtained data can be very significant for comparison with similar work of this type because it is shown in previous studies that exhaust emissions causes cancer in laboratory animals. It was assumed that significant differences between platform and background distributions were due to bus emissions which, combined with passenger waiting times, yielded an estimate of passenger exposure to ultrafine particles from diesel buses. From an exposure point of view, the Busway station analyzed resembles a street canyon. Although the detected exhaust particle concentration at the outbound platform is found to be in the picogram range, exposure increases with the time passengers spend on the platform along with their breathing frequency. © 2006 MDPI.

This paper provides a detailed analysis of the implications for indoor air pollution (IAP), drawing on new 24-h monitoring data for respirable airborne particulates (PM10). A stratified sample of 236 households was selected in Dhaka and Narayanganj, with a particular focus on fuel use, cooking locations, structural materials, ventilation practices, and other potential determinants of exposure to IAP. At each household, PM 10 concentrations in the kitchen and living room were monitored for a 24-h period during December, 2003-February, 2004. Concentrations of 300 μg/m3 or greater are common in our sample, implying widespread exposure to a serious health hazard. A regression analysis for these 236 households was then conducted to explore the relationships between PM 10 concentrations, fuel choices and a large set of variables that describe household cooking and ventilation practices, structure characteristics and building materials. As expected, our econometric results indicate that fuel choice significantly affects indoor pollution levels: natural gas and kerosene are significantly cleaner than biomass fuels. However, household-specific factors apparently matter more than fuel choice in determining PM10 concentrations. In some biomass-burning households, concentrations are scarcely higher than in households that use natural gas. Our results suggest that cross-household variation is strongly affected by structural arrangements: cooking locations, construction materials, and ventilation practices. A large variation in PM10 was also found during the 24-h cycle within households. For example, within the 'dirtiest' firewood-using household in our sample, readings over the 24-h cycle vary from 68 to 4864 μg/m3. Such variation occurs because houses can recycle air very quickly in Bangladesh. After the midday meal, when ventilation is common, air quality in many houses goes from very dirty to reasonably clean within an hour. Rapid change also occurs within households: diffusion of pollution from kitchens to living areas is nearly instantaneous in many cases, regardless of internal space configuration, and living-area concentrations are almost always in the same range as kitchen concentrations. By implication, exposure to dangerous indoor pollution levels is not confined to cooking areas. To assess the broader implications for poor Bangladeshi households, we extrapolate our regression results to representative 600 household samples from rural, peri-urban and urban areas in six regions: Rangpur in the north-west, Sylhet in the north-east, Rajshahi and Jessore in the west, Faridpur in the center, and Cox's Bazar in the south-east. Our results indicate great geographic variation, even for households in the same per capita income group. This variation reflects local differences in fuel use and, more significantly, construction practices that affect ventilation. For households with per capita income &lt;US$1.00/ day, rural PM10 concentrations vary from 410 μg/m3 in Cox's Bazar to 202 μg/m3 in Faridpur. In urban areas, concentrations for such households differ by almost 100 μg/m3 between the highest areas, Jessore and Rajshahi, and the lowest, Sylhet. © 2006 The Authors.",Cost-effective.; Indoor Air Pollution; Particulates,"air conditioning; air pollutant; article; Bangladesh; building material; cooking; energy resource; environmental monitoring; family; housing; human; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; poverty; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Bangladesh; Construction Materials; Cookery; Energy-Generating Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Family; Housing; Humans; Particulate Matter; Poverty; Ventilation","Dasgupta, S.; Development Research Group, 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, United States; эл. почта: sdasgupta@worldbank.org",,,09056947,,INAIE,17100664.0,English,Indoor Air,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750707239

The LCA was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the ISO 14000 family of standards. The LCA includes the inputs and outputs of energy and materials from (i) extraction and manufacturing of materials, (ii) construction, (iii) occupancy (including heating and cooling energy use), and (iv) maintenance over a 100-year life. The houses were modeled in five cities representing a range of U.S. climates: Miami, Phoenix, Seattle, Washington, and Chicago. The results show that in almost all cases, for a given climate, the environmental impact in each category is greater (worse) for the wood house than for the ICF house. The reduction in environmental impacts provided by the ICF house compared to the wood-frame house varied from 3% to 6%, depending on climate. Furthermore, the most significant environmental impacts are not from construction products but from the production and household use of electricity and natural gas. Since the ICF walls are more highly insulating and energy efficient than the wood-frame walls, the ICF house has lower impacts. Among construction products used in the house, wood products and copper tubing have the largest environmental load, followed by cement-based products.

Its nature of being a reproducible energy source makes its use even more attractive. There exist two ways of using biogas as an energy source: (1) as a natural gas substitute, to burn it in a boiler or in a stove to obtain heat or to supply it to a gas engine for power generation, and (2) to steam-reform it, to obtain hydrogen for fuel cell power generation or to obtain syngas (CO + H2) from which dimethylether is synthesized to be used as diesel fuel substitute for farm machines. The former way of utilization has been commonly employed worldwide. In this article, we present the latter way that involves steam reforming of biogas for its further use as an energy source. Necessary processes involved for this way of utilization are outlined, from steam reforming of biogas to the production of hydrogen or dimethylether. The chemical uniqueness of the biogas as a feedstock for steam reforming was identified, along with the difficulties to be overcome for its practical implementation. © 2006.",Biogas; Dimethylether; Hydrogen; Methane fermentation; Steam reforming; Syngas,,"Komiyama, M.; Graduate School of Medicine and Engineering, Takeda, Kofu, 400-8511, Japan; эл. почта: komiyama@mail.yamanashi.ac.jp",Soliva C.R.Takahashi J.Kreuzer M.,,05315131,,,,English,Int.

Design: A birth cohort was followed longitudinally for 3 years to determine incidence of lower respiratory illness (LRI). Participants: A total of 452 children born 1994-1996 in two districts in the Czech Republic participated. Evaluations: Indoor combustion exposures were home heating and cooking fuel, mother's smoking during pregnancy, and other adult smokers in the household. Diagnoses of LRI (primarily acute bronchitis) from birth to 3 years of age were abstracted from pediatric records. Questionnaires completed at delivery and at 3-year follow-up provided covariate information. LRI incidence rates were modeled with generalized linear models adjusting for repeated measures and for numerous potential confounders. Results: LRI diagnoses occurred more frequently in children from homes heated by coal [vs. other energy sources or distant furnaces; rate ratio (RR) = 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.97]. Maternal prenatal smoking and other adult smokers also increased LRI rates (respectively: RR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.10-2.01; and RR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.65). Cooking fuels (primarily electricity, natural gas, or propane) were not associated with LRI incidence. For children never breast-fed, coal home heating and mother's smoking conferred substantially greater risks: RR = 2.77 (95% CI, 1.45-5.27) and RR = 2.52 (95% CI, 1.31-4.85), respectively. Conclusions: Maternal smoking and coal home heating increased risk for LRI in the first 3 years of life, particularly in children not breast-fed. Relevance: Few studies have described effects of coal heating fuel on children's health in a Western country. Breast-feeding may attenuate adverse effects of prenatal and childhood exposures to combustion products.",Air pollution; Breast-feeding; Bronchitis; Childrens health; Coal heating; Environmental tobacco smoke; Indoor,"coal; fuel; natural gas; propane; tobacco smoke; air pollution; article; breast feeding; bronchitis; cohort analysis; combustion; confidence interval; controlled study; cooking; Czech Republic; delivery; electricity; energy resource; environmental exposure; female; follow up; heating; human; incidence; infant; longitudinal study; lower respiratory tract; major clinical study; male; medical record; newborn; pregnancy; preschool child; priority journal; questionnaire; respiratory tract disease; statistical model; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child, Preschool; Coal; Czech Republic; Female; Heating; Housing; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Respiration Disorders; Smoking; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Nicotiana tabacum","Hertz-Picciotto, I.; Division of Epidemiology, , Davis, CA 95616, United States; эл. почта: ihp@ucdavis.edu",,,00916765,,,16835069.0,English,Environ.

Removal of these regulators can result in elemental mercury spills inside the home. In the summer of 2000, mercury spills were discovered in the basements of several Chicago-area homes after removal of gas regulators by gas company contractors. Subsequent inspections of approximately 361,000 homes by two northern Illinois gas companies showed that 1,363 homes had residential mercury contamination. Urine mercury screening was offered to concerned residents, and results of urine bioassays and indoor mercury air measurements were available for 171 homes. Six of these 171 homes (3.5%) had a cumulative total of nine residents with a urine mercury ≥ 10 μg/L. The highest urine mercury concentration observed in a resident was 26 Qμg/L. Positive bioassays were most strongly associated with mercury air concentrations &gt; 10 μg/m3 on the first floor [odds ratio (OR) = 21.4; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.6-125.9] rather than in the basement (OR = 3.0; 95% CI, 0.3-26), and first-floor air samples were more predictive of positive bioassays than were basement samples. Overall, the risk of residential mercury contamination after gas regulator removal ranged from 0.9/1,000 to 4.3/1,000 homes, depending on the gas company, although the risk was considerably higher (20 of 120 homes, 16.7%) for one of the contractors performing removal work for one of the gas companies. Gas companies, their contractors, and residents should be aware of these risks and should take appropriate actions to prevent these spills from occurring and remediate them if they occur.",Elemental mercury; Environmental; Gas regulator; Public health; Residential; Screening; Surveillance,mercury; natural gas; air sampling; ambient air; article; bioassay; concentration (parameters); confidence interval; environmental exposure; human; priority journal; risk assessment; summer; United States; urinalysis; Adult; Biological Assay; Chicago; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Mercury; Public Health,"Hryhorczuk, D.; Great Lakes Center for Children's Environmental Health, 1900 W.

Number concentrations inside the facility ranged from 15 to 150 times greater than that outside the facility and were highly dependent on season. The greatest number concentration (&gt;1 000 000 particles cm -3) occurred in winter in an area where mass concentration was low (&lt;0.10 mg m-3). The increased number of particles was attributed to the exhaust of direct-fire, natural-gas burners used to heat the supply air. The greatest mass concentrations were found around metalworking operations that were poorly enclosed. The larger particles that dominated particle mass in this area were accompanied by ultrafine particles, probably generated through evaporation and subsequent condensation of metalworking fluid components.

Methods: Qualitative and quantitative information was gathered during visits to companies involved in offshore oil and gas production in Norway. Monitoring reports on oil mist and oil vapour exposure covered 37 drilling facilities. Exposure data were analysed using descriptive statistics and by constructing linear mixed-effects models. Results: Samples had been taken during the use of three generations of hydrocarbon base oils, namely diesel oils (1979-1984), low-aromatic mineral oils (1985-1997) and non-aromatic mineral oils (1998-2004). Sampling done before 1984 showed high exposure to diesel vapour (arithmetic mean, AM = 1217 mg m-3). When low-aromatic mineral oils were used, the exposure to oil mist and oil vapour was 4.3 and 36 mg m-3, and the respective AMs for non-aromatic mineral oils were reduced to 0.54 and 16 mg m-3. Downward time trends were indicated for both oil mist (6% per year) and oil vapour (8% per year) when the year of monitoring was introduced as a fixed effect in a linear mixed-effects model analysis. Rig type, technical control measures and mud temperature significantly determined exposure to oil mist. Rig type, type of base oil, viscosity of the base oil, work area, mud temperature and season significantly determined exposure to oil vapour. Major decreases in variability were found for the between-rig components. Conclusions: Exposure to oil mist and oil vapour declined over time in the mud-handling areas of offshore drilling facilities.

Roosevelt Rd., Bldg. 5, West Chicago, IL 60185, United States","Sources of elemental mercury (Hg0) include old natural gas regulators, manometers, sphygmo-manometers, thermometers, and thermostats. Causes of Hg0 spills include improper storage, container breakage, children playing with Hg0, the breakage of devices containing Hg0, and ritualistic use of Hg0. Inhalation is the primary exposure route for Hg0. Mercury released into the environment can enter lakes and streams, where bacteria convert it into methylmercury, which bioaccumulates in fish. Chronic exposure to Hg0 vapors can damage the kidneys and neurologic system. Short-term exposure to high levels of Hg0 vapors may cause lung damage, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increases in blood pressure or heart rate, skin rashes, and eye irritation, among other effects. Minimizing Hg0 dispersal is important after an Hg0 spill. Tracking by shoes or apparel or vacuuming can spread Hg0, increasing airborne concentrations and cleanup costs. The Illinois Department of Public Health's response to an Hg0 spill depends on the size of the spill. Airborne concentrations after large spills are mapped with a mercury vapor analyzer (MVA). The cleanup begins with the spill site and any hot spots that were identified with the MVA. Hard surfaces can usually be cleaned, but contaminated porous items must be discarded. Leaving marginally contaminated items outdoors for a month or more during warm weather may dissipate the Hg0. After a cleanup, clearance sampling is conducted to determine if further cleanup is needed. The best way to prevent Hg0 spills is reduce its use.",Cleanup; Elemental mercury; Health effects; Mercury; Prevention; Remediation; Spill; Spill management,mercury; methylmercury; natural gas; air quality control; bacterial metabolism; bioaccumulation; blood pressure; container; diarrhea; environmental release; eye irritation; fish; heart rate; human; inhalation; lake; long term exposure; lung injury; manometer; mercurialism; nausea and vomiting; nonhuman; note; play; porosity; priority journal; public health service; rash; shoe; sphygmomanometer; spillage; storage; stream (river); thermometer; United States; vacuum; vapor; walking; water contamination; weather; Accidents; Adult; Child; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Pollution; Equipment Contamination; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Manufactured Materials; Mercury; Volatilization; Waste Management; Bacteria (microorganisms),"Baughman, T.A.; Environmental Toxicology Section, 245 W.

Concerns remain regarding mercury contamination in aqueous ecosystems. Significant quantities of mercury are present in fossil fuels, particularly petrochemicals. We still manage to pollute the atmosphere and environment by the use of coal and petrochemicals. The impact of mercury in natural gas has been such that there have been at least six experiences of plant failure which have been traced to corrosion due to mercury attacks on aluminium rotors in the plant fabric. Very little attention is being given to mercury removal strategies, and in order for these to be successful there is an urgent requirement to determine the speciation profile of the natural gas or liquid hydrocarbon condensates. Atomic fluorescence spectrometry is an ideal analytical technique to determine the levels of mercury both before and after removal systems. The authors will outline achievements of both laboratory and online measurement systems for this important area of research. These systems have been operating at the required levels of performance and in the case of some of the online systems, have been in place operating 24 hours per day 7 days per week for more than 2 years. This has encouraged other companies to install similar systems.

Eighteen mink (Mustela vison) studied were fed one of three diets during a 25 d period in a parallel-group design. The compared diets had 0, 17 and 67 % extracted lipids from natural gas-utilising bacteria (LNGB), which were rich in PE. The group with 0 % LNGB was fed a diet of 100 % soyabean oil (SB diet). Phospholipids are the main lipid components in LNGB and Methylococcus capsulatus is the main bacteria (90 %). The fasting plasma concentration of tHcy was significantly higher when the mink consumed the diet with 67 % LNGB than when they consumed the SB diet (P=0.039). A significantly lower glutathione peroxidase activity was observed in mink consuming the 17 % LNGB diet or the 67 % LNGB diet than was observed in mink fed the SB diet. The lack of significant differences in the level of plasma PE due to the diets indicates that most of the PE from the 67 % LNGB diet was converted to phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the liver. It has previously been hypothesised that phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase is an important source of tHcy. The present results indicate that plasma tHcy is at least partly regulated by phospholipid methylation from PE to PC. This methylation reaction is a regulator of physiological importance. © The Authors 2005.",Diet; Homocysteine; Natural gas-utilising bacteria; Phosphatidylethanolamine,homocysteine; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase; soybean oil; amino acid blood level; animal experiment; article; blood sampling; calorimetry; chemical composition; concentration (parameters); concentration response; controlled study; dietary intake; enzyme activity; male; Methylococcus capsulatus; mink; nonhuman; nutritional value; statistical analysis; statistical significance; Animal Feed; Animals; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Glutathione Peroxidase; Homocysteine; Liver; Male; Methylococcus capsulatus; Mink; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Phospholipids; Soybean Oil; Animalia; Glycine max; Methylococcus capsulatus; Mustela vison,"Müller, H.; Department of Animal and Aquacultural Sciences, PO Box 5003, N-1432 Ås, Norway; эл. почта: hanne.muller@umb.no",,,00071145,,BJNUA,16277769.0,English,Br.

Measurements were made during 24 morning and afternoon commutes on two Los Angeles Unified School District bus routes from South to West Los Angeles, with seven additional runs on a rural/suburban route, and three runs to test the effect of window position. For these commutes, the mean concentrations of diesel vehicle-related pollutants ranged from 0.9 to 19 μg/m3 for black carbon. 23 to 400 ng/m3 for particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PB-PAH), and 64 to 220 μg/m3 for NO2. Concentrations of benzene and formaldehyde ranged from 0.1 to 11 μg/m3 and 0.3 to 5 μg/m 3, respectively. The highest real-time concentrations of black carbon, PB-PAH and NO2 inside the buses were 52 μg/m3, 2000 ng/m3, and 370 μg/m3, respectively. These pollutants were significantly higher inside conventional diesel buses compared to the CNG bus, although formaldehyde concentrations were higher inside the CNG bus. Mean black carbon, PB-PAH, benzene and formaldehyde concentrations were higher when the windows were closed, compared with partially open, in part, due to intrusion of the bus's own exhaust into the bus cabin, as demonstrated through the use of a tracer gas added to each bus's exhaust. These same pollutants tended to be higher on urban routes compared to the rural/suburban route, and substantially higher inside the bus cabins compared to ambient measurements. Mean concentrations of pollutants with substantial secondary formation, such as PM2.5, showed smaller differences between open and closed window conditions and between bus routes. Type of bus, traffic congestion levels, and encounters with other diesel vehicles contributed to high exposure variability between runs. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",Air pollutant; Black carbon; Bus; Children; Diesel; Exposure,"benzene; carbon; diesel fuel; formaldehyde; nitric oxide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; fossil fuel; air pollution; article; child health; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; rural area; school; suburban area; child; child welfare; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; indoor air pollution; rural population; student; United States; urban population; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Child Welfare; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Humans; Los Angeles; Motor Vehicles; Rural Population; Students; Urban Population; Vehicle Emissions","Winer, A.M.; UCLA School of Public Health, 650 Charles E.

The current work compares PM 2.5-induced mortality in alternative public bus transportation strategies as being considered by the Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council, Finland. The current bus fleet and transportation volume is compared to four alternative hypothetical bus fleet strategies for the year 2020: (1) the current bus fleet for 2020 traffic volume, (2) modern diesel buses without particle traps, (3) diesel buses with particle traps, and (4) buses using natural gas engines. The average population PM2.5 exposure level attributable to the bus emissions was determined for the 1996-1997 situation using PM 2.5 exposure measurements including elemental composition from the EXPOLIS-Helsinki study and similar element-based source apportionment of ambient PM2.5 concentrations observed in the ULTRA study. Average population exposure to particles originating from the bus traffic in the year 2020 is assumed to be proportional to the bus emissions in each strategy. Associated mortality was calculated using dose-response relationships from two large cohort studies on PM2.5 mortality from the United States. Estimated number of deaths per year (90% confidence intervals in parenthesis) associated with primary PM2.5 emissions from buses in Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2020 were 18 (0-55), 9 (0-27), 4 (0-14), and 3 (0-8) for the strategies 1-4, respectively. The relative differences in the associated mortalities for the alternative strategies are substantial, but the number of deaths in the lowest alternative, the gas buses, is only marginally lower than what would be achieved by diesel engines equipped with particle trap technology. The dose-response relationship and the emission factors were identified as the main sources of uncertainty in the model. © 2005 Society for Risk Analysis.",Air pollution; Compressed natural gas; Public transport; Risk assessment,"Diesel engines; Fleet operations; Gas engines; Health care; Particulate emissions; Traffic control; Bus traffic; Diesel buses; Particle trap technology; Premature mortality; Bus transportation; natural gas; bus transport; health impact; medical geography; particulate matter; traffic emission; air pollution; cancer mortality; cardiovascular disease; diesel engine; dose response; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; Finland; health hazard; human; lung cancer; model; mortality; particulate matter; review; risk assessment; traffic; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Finland; Fossil Fuels; Gasoline; Health; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Mortality; Motor Vehicles; Particle Size; Risk Assessment; Vehicle Emissions; Eastern Hemisphere; Etela-Suomen; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Helsinki; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; World","Tainio, M.; National Public Health Institute, PO Box 95, FIN-70701 Kuopio, Finland; эл. почта: Marko.Tainio@ktl.fi",,,02724332,,RIAND,15787764.0,English,Risk Anal.,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16344375407

Correspondingly, the potential health risks for these and other nanoparticulate materials have been of considerable concern. Toxicological studies, while sparse, have been concerned with virtually uncharacterized, single wall carbon nanotubes, and the conclusions have been conflicting and uncertain. In this research we performed viability assays on a murine lung macrophage cell line to assess the comparative cytotoxicity of commercial, single wall carbon nanotubes (ropes) and two different multiwall carbon nanotube samples; utilizing chrysotile asbestos nanotubes and black carbon nanoaggregates as toxicity standards. These nanotube materials were completely characterized by transmission electron microscopy and observed to be aggregates ranging from 1 to 2 μm in mean diameter, with closed ends. The cytotoxicity data indicated a strong concentration relationship and toxicity for all the carbon nanotube materials relative to the asbestos nanotubes and black carbon. A commercial multiwall carbon nanotube aggregate exhibiting this significant cell response was observed to be identical in structure to multiwall carbon nanotube aggregates demonstrated to be ubiquitous in the environment, and especially in indoor environments, where natural gas or propane cooking stoves exist. Correspondingly, preliminary epidemiological data, although sparse, indicate a correlation between asthma incidence or classification, and exposure to gas stoves. These results suggest a number of novel epidemiological and etiological avenues for asthma triggers and related respiratory or other environmental health effects, especially since indoor number concentrations for multiwall carbon nanotube aggregates is at least 10 times the outdoor concentration, and virtually all gas combustion processes are variously effective sources. These results also raise concerns for manufactured carbon nanotube aggregates, and related fullerene nanoparticles. © 2005 MDPI.

The study determines the sensitivity of the results to variations in component failure rates and consequences of fire events. The components and subsystems that contribute most to fire safety risk are determined. Finally, the results are compared to fire risks of the present generation of diesel-fueled school buses. Direct computation of the safety risks associated with diesel-powered vehicles is possible because these are mature technologies for which historical performance data are available. Because of limited experience, fatal accident data for CNG bus fleets are minimal. Therefore, this study uses the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) approach to model and predict fire safety risk of CNG buses. Generic failure data, engineering judgments, and assumptions are used in this study. This study predicts the mean fire fatality risk for typical CNG buses as approximately 0.23 fatalities per 100-million miles for all people involved, including bus passengers. The study estimates mean values of 0.16 fatalities per 100-million miles for bus passengers only. Based on historical data, diesel school bus mean fire fatality risk is 0.091 and 0.0007 per 100-million miles for all people and bus passengers, respectively. One can therefore conclude that CNG buses are more prone to fire fatality risk by 2.5 times that of diesel buses, with the bus passengers being more at risk by over two orders of magnitude. The study estimates a mean fire risk frequency of 2.2 × 10-5 fatalities/bus per year. The 5% and 95% uncertainty bounds are 9.1 × 10-6 and 4.0 × 10-5, respectively. The risk result was found to be affected most by failure rates of pressure relief valves, CNG cylinders, and fuel piping. © 2005 Society for Risk Analysis.",CNG bus; CNG risk; Fire risk; Natural gas; Risk comparison,Accident prevention; Data reduction; Diesel fuels; Failure analysis; Fire hazards; Natural gas; Risk assessment; Bus fleets; Compressed natural gas (CNG); Failure data; Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA); Buses; diesel fuel; natural gas; bus transport; hazard management; risk assessment; transportation safety; analytic method; article; biofuel production; comparative study; fire protection; hazard; model; motor vehicle; pipeline; prediction; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty,"Modarres, M.; Center for Technology Risk Studies, , College Park, MD 20742, United States; эл. почта: modarres@umd.edu",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,02724332,,RIAND,15876211.0,English,Risk Anal.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-18744413709

Unfortunately, some parts of MIS are contaminated by subsurface leakage of natural gas containing H 2S. In order to investigate the possible effect(s) of chronic exposure to sulfur compounds on suicidal behavior, the present study was done. In the 2-year period, 561 individuals attempted suicide (260 men and 301 women). Completed suicide comprised of 19 men and 32 women. The rate per 100,000 person-years was 19.9 for men and 34.8 for women aged over 15 years. Forty-two (13 men and 29 women) of 561 patients were self-immolators by fire with a male:female ratio 0.45. This represents 22.4 burns per 100,000 person-years and is equivalent to 7.4% of all suicide attempts. Thirty-three of 42 patients died (78.6%) who were 9 men and 24 women with male:female ratio 0.37. There is statistically significant differences between sex groups (P (2) = 0.0091). The self-inflicted burn was the most frequent method for lethal suicide. Winter was the most common season for self-burning followed by spring. Statistical analysis showed significant difference between seasons for self-inflicted burn (P (2) = 0.00001).

Methods Analysis is based on 3559 childbirths in the 5 years preceding the 1999 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey. Birth weights, recorded by trained professionals at local health clinics, were derived from health cards at home or from mother's recall. Multiple regression method was used to estimate the effect of household use of biomass cooking fuels (wood, dung, or straw) on birth weight, after controlling for child's sex and birth order, mother's education and nutritional status, pregnancy care, household living standard, and other potentially confounding factors. Results Babies born to mothers cooking with wood, dung, or straw were 175 g lighter (95% CI,-300,-50), on average, compared with babies born to mothers using LPG, natural gas, or electricity. The difference was 120 g (95% CI,-301, 61) for children whose birth weights were taken from health cards, and 183 g (95% CI,-376, 10) for children whose birth weights were reported by mothers. Conclusions Household use of high pollution cooking fuels may cause reduced birth weight. The relationship needs to be further investigated using more direct measures of smoke exposure and birth weight and accounting for environmental tobacco smoke. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

At a receiver station the man intended to pick up two so called cleaning pigs, each weighing about 150 kg, diameter 0.5 m. For this purpose the gas pressure in the pig trap was let off by a valve, manometer controlled. According to an eyewitness's statement, the receiver pressure was equal to outside air pressure before the accident. The victim stood right in front of the flap of the receiver when he began to unfix the screws of the flap. Whilst working, the flap snapped out driven by the two cleaning pigs. The man and the devices were flung through a wire-netting fence and dropped down on a nearby field at a distance of 27, 29 and 38 m, respectively, from the receiver. The man died on the scene of the accident. The forensic autopsy ordered by the prosecution revealed signs of massive blunt trauma on the head, thorax and abdomen. In the criminological and forensic reconstruction of the accident the external injuries of the victim were found to be consistent with the front surface of the cleaning pig flung out first. It was determined that the second pig had got stuck in the receiver and that gas pressure had built up behind the pigs due to a leaky valve. As a consequence the pigs were expelled at a velocity of approximately 220 km/h causing a pattern of injury comparable to that of a fall from a great height.","Accident at work, reconstruction; Blunt force; Cleaning Pig; Pipeline","abdominal blunt trauma; accidental death; autopsy; blunt trauma; case report; cleaning; device; forensic medicine; head injury; human; occupational accident; pipeline; pressure; review; thorax injury; victim; Accidents, Occupational; Atmospheric Pressure; Autopsy; Equipment Failure Analysis; Fossil Fuels; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Trauma; Wounds, Nonpenetrating","Weber, M.; c/o Institut für Rechtsmedizin, Johannisallee 28, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",,,00039225,,ARKRA,15553280.0,German,Arch.

One way to assess this change is to compare the health risks due to the current fleet with the level of risk that modified fleets with new technologies will induce. Research preceding the introduction of these new technologies cannot measure air concentrations to assess this risk and must model them instead. Accordingly, we developed a simplified dispersion model to calculate the mean atmospheric concentrations in a town from emissions estimated by Copert III v2.1. The model simulates the town as a box in which the air is perfectly mixed. The base surface of the box is the area of the town and the height is 10 meters or less. Pollutants are emitted inside the box and exchanges with the outside of the box are modelled as a single vertical flow between the roofs of the buildings. The model was scaled to Paris and then tested by comparing the results with the atmospheric concentrations measured by the air quality monitoring network (Airparif) and with another model. The traffic-related concentrations, calculated from the measurements, and the model results differ by less than 50% for all pollutants tested, for both annual and daily concentrations. Differences of 12% and 16% were observed between the concentrations modelled and measured for NOx and CO, respectively. The model overestimates annual benzene concentrations by 50%, but the values calculated from the air quality monitoring data were more uncertain for benzene than for any other pollutant. The model underestimates PM10 concentrations by 38%, probably because it does not calculate the particulate matter that is re-formed and re-suspended. The conformity of our results with the data from air quality monitoring means that our model can be used to study the impact of changing fleets of vehicles with scenarios that include new technology, new levels of motor vehicle use, and new fuels or improved fuel quality in a large city such as Paris. In general, the model can be used to compare different emission hypotheses but should not be used to estimate absolute concentrations.","Air pollutants, environmental; Mathematical model; Public health; Risk assessment; Urban health; Vehicle emission",benzene; carbon monoxide; fuel; nitrogen oxide; air monitoring; air pollutant; article; atmospheric dispersion; calculation; France; mathematical model; particulate matter; public health; risk assessment; traffic; urban area,"Nedellec, V.; Vincent Nedellec Consultants, 15, rue Firmin Gillot, 75015 Paris, France; эл. почта: vincent.nedellec@wanadoo.fr",,,16350421,,ERSNA,,French,Envir.

Some parts of Masjid-i-Sulaiman (located in the southwest of Iran) are contaminated by subsurface leakage of natural gas, which contains a high level of hydrogen sulfide. The amount of all reactive sulfur compounds in air of contaminated areas of MIS was estimated as equal to 0.023±0.002ppm of SO2. In the present report the hematological findings of 99 persons from polluted areas of MIS were compared with those of 396 individuals from the general population of MIS matched by age (±3 years) and sex. The CBC test and the WBC differential were analyzed in one central laboratory according to standard hematological methods, by Coulter S (Biomedical). The multiple linear regression method was applied in order to detect differences among exposed and unexposed groups for hematological markers. The absolute mean number of red blood cells, percentages of hematocrit, level of hemoglobin, and absolute number of platelets were significantly higher among the exposed subjects compared with the control group.

The sampling strategy followed consisted in collecting simultaneously 67 samples of PM 10 particulate matter in 9 sampling sites covering an area of about 30 km2 during one week. The collection was performed on ash-free fibre-glass filters using high volume samplers. A combination of aqua regia and perchloric acid was used for leaching metals from filters. Key elements, namely Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, S, Sb, Sn, Zn and Zr, were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) at μg g-1 and ng g-1 levels. Analyte concentration varied from 130 ng g -1 (Mo) to over 30% (Ca). Multivariate statistical analysis was performed on the data set including the measured elemental compositions for the monitored period. The atmospheric concentration found for Pb confirms the decreasing levels of this element since the introduction of unleaded gasoline in 1995: 88 ng m-3 (2001) &lt; 220 ng m-3 (1997) &lt; 3900 ng m-3 (1994). The average S concentration above 3 μg m -3 is somehow unexpectedly high for Buenos Aires since the relatively low S content of liquid fuels and the massive usage of natural gas imply low emissions of this element from combustion activities. To the best of our knowledge, S concentrations are reported for the first time for this city.",,"aluminum; antimony; calcium; copper; fuel; iron; lead; manganese; molybdenum; natural gas; nickel; sulfur; tin; trace metal; zinc; zirconium; aerosol; air monitoring; air sampling; airborne particle; Argentina; atmosphere; chemical composition; combustion; concentration (parameters); conference paper; exhaust gas; filter; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry; mass spectrometry; multivariate analysis; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; priority journal; spectrometry; urban area; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Argentina; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; Trace Elements; Fraxinus","Gómez, D.R.; Comn.

It has produced toxicity in workers in numerous industries and occupations. Methods: A review of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (USBLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) for occupational deaths related to hydrogen sulfide from 1993 to 1999 was performed. Results: Fifty-two workers died of hydrogen sulfide toxicity in this 7-year period. Deaths were most commonly reported in workers who were white (85%), male (98%), and in their first year of employment with the company (48%). Common industries included waste management, petroleum, and natural gas. In 21% of cases, a co-worker died simultaneously or in the attempt to save the workers. Conclusions: Hydrogen sulfide toxicity is uncommon, but potentially deadly. Toxicity is predominantly in new workers and co-worker fatalities occur in a significant minority of cases.

It can accumulate in buildings, and inhalation of this gas and its decay products is a potential human health risk. Effective risk management needs to determine in advance the areas in which the density of buildings with high radon levels is likely to be highest. Research programs over the past several years have successfully developed a methodology for predicting and mapping the radon exhalation potential at the soil surface. This approach, based on quantification of the radon flux at the surface, starts from a precise characterization of the main local geological and pedological variables that influence the radon source and its transport to the soil/atmosphere interface. The methodology crosses the cartographic analysis into a Geographic Information System (GIS) and a simplified model for vertical transport of radon by diffusion through pores in the soil. This code, called TRACHGEO, calculates the radon flux density as a function of the chemical and physical properties of the rock and the subjacent soil. In this paper, we discuss the results from the application of this approach to an area (3,000 km2) located in Brittany (Western France). We discuss the validity of our forecasts and the use of such predictive maps as guides for radon risk management in existing or future buildings.","France; Geology; Radiation monitoring; Radon; Risk management; Soil pollutants, radioactive",natural gas; radioactive material; radium 226; radon 222; uranium 238; accuracy; article; atmospheric radioactivity; atmospheric transport; building; calculation; concentration (parameters); decomposition; exhalation; France; gas transport; geographic distribution; geology; health hazard; inhalation; prediction; quantitative analysis; radiation detection; radiation exposure; radiation monitoring; radioactive contamination; risk management; soil pollution; technique; transport kinetics; validation process,"Ielsch, G.; IRSN, BP 17, 92262 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; эл. почта: geraldine.ielsch@irsn.fr",,,16350421,,ERSNA,,French,Envir.

To elucidate possible differences in suicide numbers after the political change in Germany in 1989 (chosen cut off day 30th of November 1989) all files of suicide cases from 1985 up to 1993 were analysed. Alter After the change, the analysis was partly restricted to attorney files and death certificates, because the autopsy rate dropped dramatically. 236 cases before and 147 cases after the political change could be included. Suicide rate, mean age, age distribution, suicide method, profession, season, number of foregoing suicide attempts, and motive were compared. Significance was proven by the X2- test (p=0.05). There were no differences between the groups in gender relation (male: female app. 2/3: 1/3) and mean age. The drop in the suicide method ""carbon monoxide poisoning"" (from 18.1% to 8.8% of the suicides) was caused by the replacement of city gas by natural gas. At the same time the suicide method ""jump from a height"" rose significantly from 5.7% to 10.9%. There was a significant rose in suicides committed by unemployed and persons without a profession, but unemployment was a new category after the political change. All other differences reached no significant level. Changes in the motives could not be detected. In total, the average suicide rate dropped after the political change from 44.91/100000 inhabitants (1985 till November 1989) to 35.18/100000 (1990-1993). Beside a possible rise of the number of unreported cases (lowering of the autopsy rate), our results do not support the prognosis that the political change would result in a dramatically rising of the suicide rate; in the contrary, the first post-change suicide rate was the lowest in the study time and besides a continuously rise till 1993 did not again reach the suicide rates of the GDR.",East Germany; Political change; Suicide rates,adult; age distribution; article; autopsy; carbon monoxide intoxication; chi square test; controlled study; death certificate; female; gas; Germany; human; hypothesis; jumping; major clinical study; male; medical record; motivation; occupation; politics; prognosis; seasonal variation; sex difference; social aspect; suicidal behavior; suicide; suicide attempt; technique; unemployment,"Banaschak, S.; Institute of Legal Medicine, Fuerstengraben 23, D-07743 Jena, Germany; эл. почта: Sibylle.Banaschak@med.uni-jena.de",,,12218618,,RMLGB,,English,Rom.

The categories of chemical, physical, ergonomic, biological, and psychological hazards were surveyed. The first stage was to formulate and confirm a list of hazardous agents extant within the Pipeline Operations. This was done by making on-site observations and interviewing safety supervisors and workers, as well as by exploring the literature on the natural gas industry. The second stage of the project entailed the collection of data about whether a particular hazardous agent was present at a location, and if so, which workers were exposure to it, and at what intensity and frequency they were exposed. This assessment was made by groups identified as expert assessors, senior workers who were familiar with the processes and range of job titles at their locations. These experienced workers rated all job titles for workers at that site. The final stage of the project was to critically examine and validate the data collected. Three analyses were performed. The first was a comparison of the assessments with known outcomes of the medical surveillance testing that was completed in 1995. Secondly, the agreement between the assessments done by the expert assessor group, and a rating done by the jobholder, was examined. Finally, consideration was given to the sureness expressed by each of the rating groups about the analysis they had provided. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The average formaldehyde levels in living rooms and kitchens were 0.064 and 0.060ppm, respectively. The correlations between formaldehyde levels and type of house, construction materials, and method of ventilation were assessed. Formaldehyde levels were found to be significantly higher in apartments than in detached houses (living room: χ2 = 38.7, p&lt;0.001; kitchen: χ 2 = 43.2, p&lt;0.001), significantly higher in reinforced concrete homes than in brick and mortar homes (living room: χ2 = 43.1, p&lt;0.001; kitchen: χ2 = 34.9, p&lt;0.001), and significantly higher in homes using mechanical methods of ventilation than in homes with natural ventilation only (χ2 = 6.2, p&lt;0.05).

Reliance on biomass for cooking and heating exposes many women and young children in developing countries to high levels of air pollution indoors. This study investigated the association between household use of biomass fuels for cooking and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in preschool age children (<5 years) in Zimbabwe. Methods. Analysis is based on 3559 children age 0-59 months included in the 1999 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS). Children who suffered from cough accompanied by short, rapid breathing during the 2 weeks preceding the survey were defined as having suffered from ARI. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of suffering from ARI among children from households using biomass fuels (wood, dung, or straw) relative to children from households using cleaner fuels (liquid petroleum gas [LPG]/natural gas, or electricity), after controlling for potentially confounding factors. Results. About two-thirds (66%) of children lived in households using biomass fuels and 16% suffered from ARI during the 2 weeks preceding the survey interview. After adjusting for child's age, sex, birth order, nutritional status, mother's age at child-birth, education, religion, household living standard, and region of residence, children in households using wood, dung, or straw for cooking were more than twice as likely to have suffered from ARI as children from households using LPG/natural gas or electricity (OR = 2.20; 95% CI: 1.16, 4.19). Conclusions. Household use of high pollution biomass fuels is associated with ARI in children in Zimbabwe. The relationship needs to be further investigated using more direct measures of smoke exposure and clinical measures of ARI.",Biomass; Child; Indoor air pollution; Respiratory tract infections; Smoke; Zimbabwe,"liquefied petroleum gas; natural gas; air quality; biomass; child health; combustion; indoor air; respiratory disease; acute respiratory tract disease; article; biomass; birth order; breathing disorder; combustion; controlled study; cooking; coughing; education; electricity; female; health survey; household; human; indoor air pollution; infant; interview; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; maternal age; medical parameters; nutritional status; preschool child; priority journal; religion; straw; wood; Zimbabwe; Acute Disease; Air Pollution, Indoor; Biomass; Child, Preschool; Cookery; Developing Countries; Female; Health Surveys; Heating; Housing; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Prevalence; Respiratory Tract Infections; Risk Factors; Smoke; Zimbabwe; Zimbabwe","Mishra, V.; Population and Health Studies, 1601 East-West Road, Honolulu, HI 96848-1601, United States; эл. почта: MishraV@_xxastWestCenter.Org",,,03005771,,IJEPB,14559763.0,English,Int.

Methods: Regular pollutants including B(a)P were monitored and 1-hydroxy pyrene were tested in urine of the enrolled subjects. Radon concentrations and their changes in four seasons were also monitored in the city natural gas from its source plant and transfer stations to final users. To analyze organic components of coal gas, liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas, a high-flow sampling device specially designed was used to collect their combustion products, and semi-volatile organic compounds contained in the particles were detected by gas chromatograph-mass spectrograph (GC/MS). Results: Findings in the study showed that the regular indoor air pollutants particles and CO were all above the standard in winter when heating facilities were operated in the city, but they were lowest in kitchens using natural gas; furthermore, although NO2 and CO2 were slightly higher in natural gas, B(a)P concentration was lower in this group and 1-hydroxy pyrene was lowest in urine of the subjects exposed to natural gas. Organic compounds were more complicated in coal gas and liquefied petroleum gas than in natural gas. The concentration of radon in natural gas accounted for less than 1‰ of its effective dose contributing to indoor air pollution in Beijing households.

For human consumption, removal of the nucleic acid is necessary. Preliminary studies have shown that ingested BP induces a specific immune response. The objective of the present study was to characterize the type of response, its development over time and product-related causative factors. Mice were fed with diets containing 60 g nucleic acid-reduced BP/kg, 240 g nucleic acid-reduced BP/kg, 240 g untreated BP (basic BP)/kg or 240 g casein/kg (control). In another study, mice were fed 240 g basic BP/kg, whole cell-free BP-culture homogenate or control diet. The immune response was monitored using an ELISA for BP-specific immunoglobulin in blood and BP-specific immunoglobulin A in blood and saliva. Ingested BP induced a steady specific mucosal and systemic immune response, characterized by a dose-dependent production of immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin A in blood and immunoglobulin A in saliva. Basic BP and nucleic acid-reduced BP induced identical responses. However, feeding mice BP-culture homogenate induced immunoglobulin A in saliva but there was no systemic response.

Thus, ingestion of BP induces a persistent mucosal and systemic immune response of which the systemic response can be avoided by ingesting a BP preparation free of whole cells.

The XW lung cancer rate is associated with exposure to coal smoke, containing high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in unvented homes. Here we investigated codon 12 K-ras mutations in lung tumors or sputum samples from 102 XW lung cancer patients (41 nonsmoking women and 61 smoking men). In addition, we analyzed specimens from 50 lung cancer patients (14 nonsmoking women, 33 smoking men and three nonsmoking men), from Beijing and Henan (B&H), where natural gas is the main domestic fuel. K-ras mutations were found in nine women (21.9%) and 14 men (22.9%) from XW, with G to T transversions accounting for 66.7 and 85.7%, respectively. Among B&H patients, one woman (7.1%) and six men (16.7%) had K-ras mutations, with G to T transversions accounting for 66.7% of the mutations in the men. Therefore, the frequency and type of K-ras mutations in XW nonsmoking women are similar to those of K-ras mutations found in both XW and B&H smoking men. On the other hand, the mutation frequency in XW women is higher than, although not statistically significant from, that in the B&H nonsmoking women (P=0.28, two-sided Fisher's Exact Test). These results suggest an association between exposure to coal smoke and the increased K-ras mutation frequency in XW nonsmoking female lung cancer patients. They also suggest that the mutagens and/or mechanisms of mutations in these nonsmoking women are similar to those responsible for K-ras mutations in cigarette smoking lung cancer patients, which are probably induced largely by chemicals such as PAHs. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Due to operational difficulties, the reactor was permanently shut down in August 1989. Plans to ship the spent reactor fuel to Idaho were thwarted by the Governor of Idaho. The inability to ship the spent reactor fuel offsite necessitated the construction of an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) in order to proceed with the decommissioning of the reactor. After loading the ISFSI, decommissioning of the reactor was initiated and successfully completed. At the same time, the site was repowered using natural gas. As part of a settlement with the owner of the reactor, the U.S. Department of Energy agreed to take title to the spent fuel in the ISFSI and obtain an NRC license for the facility. The license for the ISFSI was transferred to the DOE in June 1999. Day-to-day operations of the ISFSI are accomplished by the DOE's Maintenance and Operations contractor, Bechtel Babcock Wilcox Idaho (BBWI). BBWI also operates the Three Mile Island Unit 2 ISFSI in Idaho for the DOE.

The public and federal government opinion regarding nuclear power has since changed because the nuclear power plants are operating with unprecedented reliability and economy. Nuclear has again become the focus of attention as the natural gas prices increase coupled with capacity shortages in California in 2000-2001. Sulfur dioxide produced by burning coal causes acid rain. Green house gases such as carbon dioxide and five others come from burning fossil fuel in the power plants. The amount of heat trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes global warming and serious disruptions to agriculture and other ecosystems. In December 1997, delegates from 159 countries gathered in Kyoto, Japan, and adopted a treaty that could limit the greenhouse gases. In order to reduce the greenhouse gases, the accord encouraged the fossil fuel dependent countries to develop renewable and alternative technologies. Nuclear power is an alternative technology. With the modular type construction, standardization, and one-step approval, the nuclear power can be revived. The new reactors are safer and more efficient than plants built in the past Nuclear energy is clean, affordable and reliable and offers a potential and promise for this country and the rest of the world.

The study consisted of a non-destructive evaluation phase to determine the extent of damaged concrete and a subsequent laboratory testing phase based on concrete cores. Pulse velocity measurements during the non-destructive testing phase indicated the distressed concrete was localized. Cores removed from both unaffected and distressed locations identified during the non-destructive phase were tested in the laboratory phase to determine the Dynamic Young's Modulus of Elasticity and Air Permeability Index on 25 mm (1 inch) thick disks taken from the cores, and compressive strength. Analyzing concrete disks at 25 mm (1 inch) depths provided insight into damage gradients. The Air Permeability Index and Dynamic Young's Modulus of Elasticity measurements of the disks were effective in determining both depth and damage relative to depth as a result of the cryogenic spill. The laboratory studies confirmed that the distressed zone of the concrete was limited to a near-surface zone as suggested by the pulse velocity testing.

The viscosity of the oil may range from less than 1 cp to greater than 10,000 cp. Also, the oil and gas are not a single component but rather a broad distribution of components. The log mean T1 and T2 relaxation time of dead (gas free) crude oils are correlated with viscosity/temperature and Larmor frequency. The relaxation time of live oils deviate from the correlation for dead crude oils. This deviation can be correlated with the methane content of the oil. Natural gas in the reservoir has components other than methane. Mixing rules are developed to accommodate components such as ethane, propane, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. Interpretation of NMR logs uses both relaxation and diffusion to distinguish the different fluids present in the formation. Crude oils have a broad spectrum of components but the relaxation time distribution and diffusion coefficient distribution are correlated.

New DE technologies have changes the composition of DE considerably, reducing emissions of many of the components of health concern. The increasing similarity of modern diesel and compressed natural-gas engine emissions needs to be reflected in any regulatory analysis. Even for historical DE emissions, considerable study of DE exposure in animals or humans has not produced data useful for risk assessment. DE inhalation exposure in most species (hamsters, guinea pigs, mice) does not produce lung tumors. Inhalation studies of DE in rats found lung tumors only with lung overload, and tumors also occurred when inert dusts were inhaled at overload concentrations. The animal data are reassuring and show that DE is not a concern at ambient exposure levels. Re-analyses of occupational epidemiology have been shown to have serious shortcomings that do not allow the derivation of a quantitative cancer risk. Studies of railroad workers found no dose response; rather cancer risk appeared to decrease for individuals with greater DE exposure. Studies of truck drivers also suffer from serious flaws because of misconceptions about the year that diesel was introduced, lack of an adequate latency period, and the realization that drivers exhibited increased lung cancer risk even prior to the diesel era. Recent industrial hygiene studies of drivers show that DE was not likely to be a primary source of particles or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Further, there is no dose response across occupations. In fact, the occupation (underground miners) with the highest exposure to DE does not exhibit increased cancer risks. This new information seriously weakens earlier risk characterizations of DE by various regulatory groups. New research and better exposure measurements are needed before a reliable risk assessment of DE can be produced. © Springer-Verlag 2002.",Cancer; Diesel exhaust; Risk assessment; Toxicity,diesel fuel; natural gas; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; cancer risk; carcinogenicity; conference paper; driver; dust; exhaust gas; guinea pig; hamster; human; industrial hygiene; lung tumor; miner; mouse; mutagenicity; nonhuman; occupational cancer; occupational exposure; occupational hazard; railway employee; reliability; risk assessment; safety; Air Pollutants; Animals; Cricetinae; Environmental Exposure; Guinea Pigs; Humans; Lung; Mice; Neoplasms; Occupational Exposure; Public Policy; Risk Assessment; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions; Animalia; Cavia; Cricetinae,"Bunn III, W.B.; Intl.

In this context, a new preliminary systematic observation protocol is proposed to assess exposure to physical loading of the back using nine categories of physical risk factors: the SOPE back protocol. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the new protocol can correctly identify the level of exposure related to measured physical loading of the back. Methods: The subjects of this closed cohort study were 451 manual workers at a natural gas distribution company. The assessment of exposure was made with the protocol using groups with different job titles. The workers were followed for a 2 yr period to establish the risk of a new occurrence of complete disability related to the back (NOCD back injury) in each job grouping. Results: Based on the median of the total scores derived from the protocol, two levels of exposure were identified (high and low). Conclusion: Taking into account the limitations of this study, the protocol in development may be a good tool to establish two levels of exposure to physical loading of the back in large epidemiological studies of occupational low back pain. Further research is needed to replicate these results with larger samples and to test the reliability and predictive validity of the protocol.",Back pain; Epidemiology; Manual work,Epidemiology; Natural gas; Occupational risks; Risk assessment; Employment; Epidemiology; Physical risk factors; Health care; Risk assessment; adult; article; back; clinical protocol; cohort analysis; disability; human; injury; low back pain; major clinical study; occupational disease; occupational exposure; priority journal; reliability; risk factor; scoring system; validation process; backache; disabled person; male; middle aged; occupation; occupational health; risk assessment; weight bearing; workload; Back pain; Epidemiological studies; Gas distribution company; Manual work; Manual workers; Observation protocol; Physical exposures; Physical risk factors; Adult; Back Pain; Disabled Persons; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Health; Occupations; Risk Assessment; Weight-Bearing; Workload,"Tousignant, M.; Research Center on Aging, 1036 Rue Belvedere Sud, Sherbrooke, Que.

Design: Analysis of consecutive admissions into a brain injury rehabilitation program. Setting: Midwestern medical center. Participants: One hundred twenty-two adults diagnosed with TBI (49% severe TBI, 16% moderate TBI, 35% mild TBI). Main Outcome Measures: University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT; 3- and 40-item versions). Results: Fifty-six percent of sample exhibited impaired olfaction on the full UPSIT; 40% of these patients were unaware of their deficits. Contrary. to expectation, TBI patients detected dangerous odors (natural gas, gasoline, smoke) with high accuracy. Usefulness of a 3-item screening measure was examined: Missing even one item related to a 2:1 likelihood of being anosmic. Conclusions: These findings support past investigations indicating that anosmia, and unawareness of olfactory dysfunction, are common in persons with TBI and related to injury severity. The use of the 3-item screening measure as a gross indicator was supported, although caution is advised, because nearly 20% of patients performing perfectly on the 3-item screen scored in the anosmic range on the full UPSIT.",Anosmia; Performance characteristics; Traumatic brain injury; University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test,adult; anosmia; article; brain injury; disease severity; female; human; major clinical study; male; olfactory discrimination; performance; scoring system; screening test; validation process,"Callahan, C.D.; Memorial Medical Center, 701 North First Street, Springfield, IL 62781, United States; эл. почта: callahan.chuck@mhsil.com",,Aspen Publishers Inc.,08859701,,JHRHE,12086578.0,English,J.

CO levels were measured in the bathrooms of homes in a housing area where two deaths due to CO poisoning had occurred on the same day. CO levels were measured in a total of 197 flats from a total of 400 in an area (49%) where there were such boilers and while the boilers were in operation. The bathrooms were of standard dimensions (2.5×3×3 m). Assessment of CO levels while the boilers were in operation was carried out using a Gastech standard GT-402 portable gas monitor. In 44 (22.4%) of the bathrooms studied, CO levels were above 9 ppm, which is the 8-hour limit according to the NAAQS. CO levels in 2 bathrooms (0.7%) were found to be above 35 ppm, the maximum 1-hour exposure level. CO levels above 50 ppm, ranging from 54 to 300 ppm, were determined in 12 homes (6%). The inhabitants of these homes were informed and the necessary measures were taken to solve the problem. In 8 of these 12 houses, it was determined that chimneys were blocked. We found that CO levels were higher than risk levels for intoxication in 20.0% of the houses. The level of knowledge of the households was poor concerning dangers of CO intoxication. Since it is not uncommon for CO levels in bathrooms where there are boilers to reach dangerous levels it is recommended that their use be discouraged.

Methods As part of an ongoing investigation, we conducted a 2-year longitudinal study of lung function among 118 boilermakers. Exposure was assessed with a work history questionnaire. Spirometry measurements were performed annually. Results We found an association between annual FEV1 and hours worked at a gas-fired plant during the previous year, β = -9.8 mls/100 hours worked (95% CI:-16.0,-3.5) after adjustment for age, baseline FEV1 and cigarette smoking status. The adjusted association between FEV1 and ""ever"" worked at a gas-fired plant was -99.7 mls (95%CI: -154.8, -44.5). There was also evidence of a negative association between FEV1 and ""ever"" worked and hours worked at oil and coal-fired plants. Conclusions These data suggest an association between annual lung function loss and working at gas, coal and oil-fired plants.

Focusing on this subject the present work discloses the experimental data on slug flow characteristics occurring in a large-size, large-scale facility. The results were compared with data provided by mechanistic slug flow models in order to verify their reliability when modelling actual flow conditions. Experiments were done with natural gas and oil or water as the liquid phase. To compute the frequency and velocity of the slug cell and to calculate the length of the elongated bubble and liquid slug one used two pressure transducers measuring the pressure drop across the pipe diameter at different axial locations. A third pressure transducer measured the pressure drop between two axial location 200 m apart.

Material and methods: Bibliographical review of the last 25 years, obtained principally from the United States Environmental Protection Agency data bases, were included. The search profile was «human health» and «fossil fuels». The most important articles were selected and the most relevant quoted papers were retrieved. Results: Industrial and urban use of fossil fuels generates physical (acoustic and electromagnetic radiations) and chemical pollutants (CO2, NOx, SO2, particles, CO, chemical dangerous substances and radioactive substances). The most important dangerous chemical substances are: a) inorganic (arsenic, cadmium, chrome, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, phosphorus); b) organic (benzene, formaldehyde, naphthalene, toluene and pyrene). Radioactive substances include Uranium-238, Thorium-232, Potassium-40. All the pollutants produce adverse effects in human health, bronchial and pulmonary diseases being especially relevant for their frequency and gravity. Conclusions: 1) Fossil fuels produce environmental physical and chemical pollutants which have an adverse impact on human health. 2) These adverse effects develop in the short, medium and long term, strengthening those produced by formerly present pollutants. 3) They affect principally the pediatric population, pregnant women, elderly persons and those who suffer from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. 4) The pediatric population is especially vulnerable due to an elevated metabolic rate, physiological and anatomical immaturity and the daily outdoor activity of children. 5) Severity of diseases associated with fossil fuels derived pollutants range from banal (conjunctivitis, rhinitis, pharyngitis, etc.) to serious and potentially mortal (asthmatic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac insufficiency and increased cancer risk).",Atmospheric pollution; Chemical pollutants; Diseases associated; Fossils fuels; Pediatric population; Physical pollutants,arsenic; benzene; cadmium; carbon dioxide; chromium; cobalt; formaldehyde; fossil fuel; lead; manganese; mercury; naphthalene; natural gas; nickel; nitric oxide; oil; phosphorus; potassium 40; pyrene; radioactive material; sulfur dioxide; thorium 232; toluene; uranium 238; air pollution; bronchus disease; coal mining; data base; electromagnetic radiation; environmental protection; gravity; lung disease; oil industry; pediatrician; petrochemical industry; review,"Ferrís i Tortajada, J.; Unidad de Oncologia Pediatrica, Avda. de Campanar 21, 46009 Valencia, Spain; эл. почта: ferris_jos@gva.es",,,0034947X,,REPEA,,Spanish,Rev.

When compared with other heating systems, they offer the substantial advantage of greater energy efficiency. In addition they contribute to an improved living environment since they are fired with natural gas which is the most ecological option of all fossil fuels. Heat waves propagate from infrared heaters in the same way as the radiation from the sun, and up to 30% of this short-wave infrared radiation penetrates the skin and is absorbed by the human body. The human body is adapted to infrared radiation at this wavelength, and, consequently, people feel comfortable to be irradiated by it.

Although NIH owns and operates more than 1,300 acres and 197 buildings across the country, the main campus is in Bethesda, Maryland. This campus consists of over 312 acres and 75 laboratories and other buildings, which consume vast amounts of energy. Aware of the NIH role in setting biomedical research agendas and priorities, its administrators strive to set good examples in energy efficiency and pollution prevention. Three current projects are presented as ""best practices"" examples of meeting the stated commitment of NIH to leadership in environmental stewardship: a) design and current construction of a 250-bed clinical research hospital designed to allow conversion of patient care units to research laboratories and vice-versa; b) design and construction of a six-story research laboratory that combines energy-saving innovations with breakthroughs in research technologies; and c) a massive, $200-million modernization of the campus utility infrastructure that involves generation systems for steam and chilled water and distribution systems for chilled water, steam, potable water, electricity, communications and computer networking, compressed air, and natural gas. Based on introduction of energy-efficiency measures, millions of dollars in savings for energy needs are projected; already the local electric utility has granted several million dollars in rebates. The guiding principles of NIH environmental stewardship help to ensure that energy conservation measures maximize benefits versus cost and also balance expediency with efficiency within available funding resources.

Recently, S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) and trans,trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA) in urine have been proposed as reliable biomarkers for monitoring occupational exposure to benzene. The aim of this study was to test the applicability of S-PMA and t,t-MA as exposure biomarkers and to monitor the occupational exposure level and the extent of environmental contamination from benzene in Korea. Methods. The urinary excretion of S-PMA and t,t-MA in rats after the intraperitoneal administration of benzene (0.88~800 mg/kg body weight, 7 days) was examined. These biomarkers were also validated in human urine samples collected from elementary schoolchildren in several industrial areas including chemical manufacturing plants, oil refineries, and natural gas-producing installations in Korea. Urine was collected from elementary schoolchildren in a mountain village with no known occupational exposure to benzene and air pollution as the reference group. Results. In rats, there was a significant relationship between the benzene concentration and the excretion of the urinary S-PMA and t,t-MA as a function of concentration, and the excretion of benzene metabolites peaked on the first day after intraperitoneal administration. In human urine, higher levels of S-PMA and t,t-MA were detected more frequently in petrochemical industrial areas than in areas with no known occupational exposure to benzene. Conclusions. These results show that the quantitative determination of S-PMA and t,t-MA in urine can be used as a reliable exposure biomarker for benzene, and they also suggest that extensive attention to benzene exposure is needed for maintaining the health of the population in Korea.",Biomonitoring; Environmental contamination,acetylcysteine derivative; benzene; biological marker; muconic acid; phenylmercapturic acid; unclassified drug; benzene; biomarker; medical geography; occupational exposure; article; biological monitoring; environmental exposure; geographic distribution; human; human experiment; industrial area; Korea; nonhuman; occupational exposure; petrochemical industry; priority journal; rat; school child; urinary excretion; Korea,"Cho, M.H.; Laboratory of Toxicology, , Suwon 441-744, South Korea; эл. почта: mchotox@snu.ac.kr",,Finnish Institute of Occupational Health,03553140,,SWEHD,10744179.0,English,Scand.

The models evaluated were the generalized Mitscherlich, simple Mitscherlich, generalized Michaelis-Menten, simple Michaelis-Menten, Gompertz, and logistic. Five sets of gas production data consisting of 216 curves, obtained using a wide range of feeds (including straw, hay, silage, grain and various byproducts), were analysed to study the performance of these gas production models. Application of the non-sigmoidal models (simple Mitscherlich and Michaelis-Menten) to the data resulted in convergence problems and these models were found to be inadequate in many cases. Based on results of a pairwise comparison between models (variance ratio test), ranking of residual mean squares, lack-of-fit test, and of analyses of residuals, the generalized Mitscherlich and the generalized Michaelis-Menten models seemed particularly suited because of their flexibility to encompass sigmoidal and non-sigmoidal shapes of gas production profiles, whether symmetrical or not.",Feed degradation; Gas production; Mathematical models; Rumen,bacterial protein; natural gas; animal experiment; animal food; article; bovids; degradation; functional assessment; gas transport; mathematical computing; mathematical model; nonhuman; variance; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bovidae,"France, J.; University of Reading, PO Box 236, Earley Gate, Reading RG6 6AT, United Kingdom; эл. почта: j.france@reading.ac.uk",,CAB International,00071145,,BJNUA,10743492.0,English,Br.

In order to monitor the efficiency of an industrial facility for removal of mercury from natural gas, mercury measurements in air and lichens were performed during 9 months in 1997/1998. In situ lichens Parmelia sulcata, Xantoria parientina and Hypogymnia physodes and transplanted lichen species Hypogymnia physodes were used. A good correlation between mercury concentrations in air and lichens was found. The concentrations of barium and bromium were also significantly elevated in transplanted lichens, most probably related to technological process at the gas treatment plant and/or other geological factors. It was confirmed that lichens can successfully be used as bioindicators, provided a careful experiment is designed, particularly the amount of lichens transplanted, the duration of exposure and the initial levels and homogeneity of transplanted lichens.",,"barium; biological marker; bromine; mercury; natural gas; accuracy; air analysis; air pollution; article; biological monitoring; chemical industry; Croatia; environmental protection; lichen; measurement; priority journal; Croatia; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fossil Fuels; Industry; Lichens; Mercury; Metals, Heavy; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tissue Distribution; Hypogymnia physodes; Parmelia sulcata; Xantoria parientina","Horvat, M.; Department of Environmental Sciences, , Ljubljana, Slovenia",,,14640325,,JEMOF,11253033.0,English,J.

Acute exposures to hydrogen sulfide can occur during the exploration, extraction, handling and processing of oil and natural gas. These exposures sometimes result in loss of consciousness (i.e., knockdown) and may be fatal. Analyses of two large case series of workers acutely exposed to hydrogen sulfide, primarily from the oil and gas industry in Alberta, showed that the workers experienced significant acute morbidity. This included neurological problems such as loss of consciousness, headache, nausea and vomiting, disequilibrium, neuropsychological problems and convulsions. Respiratory problems including dyspnea, sore throat and cough, pulmonary edema, cyanosis and hemoptysis were also reported. Many workers suffered from trauma resulting from falls associated with loss of consciousness or balance problems. The case-fatality rate in the first series (n=221) was 6.0%. This was reduced to 2.8% in the second series of 250 workers. In both case series, the authors stated that, in the absence of death or significant trauma, recovery appeared to be rapid and complete. A cross-sectional study of lung health in 175 oil and gas workers in west-central Alberta found that 8% had a history of a knockdown and an additional 29% had experienced an exposure to sour gas that was strong enough to cause symptoms. Neither of these two groups showed lung function deficits in relation to those with no history of acute exposure. However, the workers who had experienced a knockdown were more likely to report shortness of breath, wheeze with chest tightness, and attacks of wheeze. It is postulated that a subset of workers experiencing acute, high level exposures to hydrogen sulfide may be at risk of developing reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. Given the relative lack of research among workers with these exposures, this suggestion should be viewed as speculative. Future studies should collect objective information on nonspecific bronchial responsiveness. Other areas requiring research include the potential for long-term neurological and psychological sequelae, and musculoskeletal problems associated with trauma resulting from falls occurring during acute exposure episodes. There is scope for both retrospective, case-control studies and longitudinal studies that trace the natural history of neurological, respiratory, and musculoskeletal sequelae.",Epidemiology; Knockdown; Petroleum workers; Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome,hydrogen sulfide; natural gas; oil; article; falling; human; neurologic disease; occupational hazard; petrochemical industry; priority journal; respiratory tract disease,"Hessel, P.A.; University of Alberta, , Edmonton, Alta.

CI, a symptom of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), was determined from self-ratings of feeling‘moderately' to‘severely' ill using the Chemical Odor Intolerance Index (CII). Index odors included perfume, pesticide, drying paint, new carpet odor, and car exhaust. Six additional odors [natural gas, disinfectants, chlorinated water, room deodorizers, and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)] were also assessed in the health and environment survey. Asthmatics reported feeling‘frequently' to‘almost always' ill from the CII index odors of drying paint, new carpet odor, perfume, and cleaning agents compared to nonasthmatics. People with hay fever documented feeling‘frequently' to‘almost always' ill from pesticides, drying paint, and car exhaust compared to individuals without hay fever. The CI cited illness from air freshener, natural gas and chlorinated water, in addition to the index odors of perfume, paint, pesticides, new carpeting and auto exhaust. All three groups were significantly more likely to report feeling ill from ETS. People with asthma were significantly more likely to report lower lung complaints, such as wheeze and dyspnea. People with hay fever cited more chest tightness. The CI were significantly more likely to report upper and lower respiratory symptoms. Given this overlap in respiratory complaints, it could be that CI may serve to amplify these traditional immune-related disorders and/or suggest that having asthma or hay fever could make one more vulnerable to CI. © 1999, Sage Publications.

There are several pollutants of concern, among which are sulfur dioxide, total suspended particulates, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic chemicals. In several studies, researchers investigated the effects of those pollutants on lung and nasal functions, although in very few studies has nasal function been addressed. We evaluated the effects of air pollution on the prevalence of rhinitis in a metropolitan of Turkey, Istanbul. Until 1994, coal was used for both domestic heating and industrial processes in the city. Consequently, sulfur dioxide and total suspended particulate concentrations in the ambient air exceeded limits of air-quality standards. In recent years, especially during the early 1990s, hazardous air pollution levels were reached in Istanbul. In this study, we evaluated the incidence of rhinitis before and after installation of a natural-gas network in a polluted area of the city. In 1994, 62.5% of the individuals studied suffered from rhinitis, compared with 51% of the sample in 1996 (p <.05). Age, gender, smoking status, heating source, nor household crowding significantly affected this outcome.

It is not known whether risks are similarly increased in older subjects. Methods - A questionnaire about respiratory symptoms in the past year and potential risk factors for respiratory disease was mailed to 6000 men and women aged 65 years and older who were selected at random from the lists of general practices in North Bristol, UK. Associations between symptoms and the use of gas appliances were examined by logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, social class, and smoking habits. Results - Questionnaires were completed by 4792 (80%) of those mailed. The most common symptoms were exercise induced breathlessness, wheeze, or chest tightness (51%); wheeze (27%); morning phlegm (20%); and daytime breathlessness at rest (19%). In an analysis that included all subjects only weak associations were found with use of gas appliances, odds ratios all being 1.2 or less. The risks associated with use of a gas hob tended to be higher in women, with odds ratios of 1.36 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.83) for wheeze and 1.33 (95% CI 0.56 to 3.17) for morning chest tightness, but were lower than had been reported previously in younger women. Conclusion - The absence of stronger associations cannot readily be explained by bias or confounding. Gas cookers and fires are unlikely to be an important cause of respiratory illness in the elderly. If they do cause such illness, the largest risks are likely to be in women who use gas hobs.",Gas cooking; Respiratory disease,natural gas; nitrogen; oxide; aged; article; combustion; cooking; dyspnea; female; heating; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; questionnaire; respiratory tract disease; risk factor; smoking habit; social class; statistical analysis; thorax disease; United Kingdom; wheezing,"Dow, L.; Care of the Elderly, , Bristol BS16 1LE, United Kingdom",,BMJ Publishing Group,00406376,,THORA,10567631.0,English,Thorax,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032700797

The aim of the study was to compare the frequency and clinical course of CO poisonings (early or delayed medical complication or death) regarding the source of CO (illuminating or natural gas). Under analysis there were adult inhabitants of Kraków treated at the Department of Clinical Toxicology from 1972 to 1974 when the main source of CO was illuminating gas and those treated from 1994 to 1996 i.e. after the conversion of domestic gas supply from illuminating to natural gas. All the cases of people who died at the scene of the accident prior to any treatment were also included. The frequency of acute poisonings among the inhabitants of Kraków was expressed by the incidence rate per 10,000 inhabitants with regard to age and sex. The severity of CO poisoning was estimated considering age, duration of exposure, carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level, and the neurological state of patients on admission to the Clinic. Significantly higher frequency of suicidal poisonings was noted in the group of patients poisoned with illuminating gas compared to those poisoned with CO produced by incomplete combustion of natural gas (p < 0.001). No significant differences were noted considering the age of patients hospitalised in both periods. Duration of exposure was significantly longer and carboxyhemoglobin level was significantly higher in the group of patients poisoned with illuminating compared to natural gas. Significantly higher frequency of severe poisonings was noted in the group of patients intoxicated with illuminating gas compared to those intoxicated with natural gas. The frequency of acute CO poisonings in the population of Kraków determined by the incidence rate per 10,000 inhabitants was approximated to 2.4 in all the years analysed. The conversion of domestic supply from illuminating to natural gas significantly decreased the mortality rate. No differences in the number of patients suffering from medical complications were found between the two study periods.

However, the evidence &om animal studies to date indicates that emissions from vehicles operating on alternative fuels may pose less of a risk. As part of its efforts to reduce dependence on foreign oil and improve overall air quality, the U.S. Department of Energy has undertaken a major study of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) which includes a comprehensive emissions testing program. The data collected thus far indicate that, for light-duty vehicles, the levels of regulated emissions from alternative fuel models are lower than those from their conventional he1 counterparts. Emissions of air toxics, as well as ozone forming potential, are also lower for the light-duty AFVs. The reductions in emissions from heavy-duty A F V s are greatest for particulate matter. The combination of these findings with results from recent medical studies suggests that communities having higher concentrations of AFVs may experience lower emissions-related risks of disease and human health disorders, and may ultimately realize reduced costs of medical care, lower individual insurance premiums, and a generally more favorable business climate. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Environmental influences on health and health behavior have an important place in research on worksite health promotion. We tested the validity and internal consistency of a new measure of organizational health and safety climate that was used in a large randomized trial of a worksite cancer prevention program (the Working Well Trial). The resulting scales then were applied to assess intervention effects. Method. This study uses data from a subset of 40 worksites in the Working Well Trial. Employees at 20 natural gas pipeline worksites and 20 rural electrical cooperatives completed a cross-sectional questionnaire at baseline and 3-year follow-up. Results. A factor analysis of this self-report instrument produced a two-factor solution. The resulting health and safety climate scales had good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.74 and 0.82, respectively) and concurrent validity. The health climate scale was correlated more highly with organizational measures that were indicative of a supportive health climate than those indicating supportive safety climate, while the reverse was true of the safety climate scale. Changes in health climate were associated with the number of smoking and smokeless tobacco programs offered at the worksites at the time of the 3-year follow-up (r = 0.46 and 0.42, respectively). The scales were not correlated with most employee health behaviors. The health climate scores increased at intervention worksites, compared with scores at control worksites (F[1,36] = 7.57, P = 0.009). Conclusions. The health and safety climate scales developed for this study provide useful instruments for measuring organizational change related to worksite health promotion activities. The Working Well Intervention resulted in a significant improvement in worksite health climate.",Cancer prevention; Organizational climate; Scale development; Validity; Worksite health promotion,adult; article; cancer prevention; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; electronics industry; employee; female; follow up; health behavior; health promotion; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; occupational safety; organization; pipeline; priority journal; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; self report; smoking cessation; United States; work environment,"Basen-Engquist, K.; Department of Behavioral Science, , Houston, TX 77030, United States",,Academic Press Inc.,00917435,,PVTMA,9465361.0,English,Prev.

Within the processing facility the highest levels of radon were associated with propane production streams, and activities as high as 4958 Bq/m3 were found. Equipment handling these streams was also found to have a buildup of scale with lead-210, radium-224, and radium-226 activity. The transmission of salable gas to the consumer indicated a decrease in radon activity that was slightly lower than the estimated radon activity based on the half-life of radon, the distance from the production facility, and the speed of gas transmission. The risk of radon exposure to the worker was deemed well below the guidelines and would be controlled more than adequately by means of the occupational standards for the natural gas components. Gamma ray exposure was also well below the occupational standards. Radon exposure to the consumer was virtually nonexistent in the Vancouver region from both natural gas and propane. Although this might not be the case for consumers of propane closer to the production facilities, its contribution is likely to be minimal.",Lead-210; Natural gas processing; Occupational exposure; Radioactive contaminants; Radium-224/226; Radon-222,lead 210; radium 224; radium 226; radon 222; air pollution; article; Canada; cleaning; consumer; environmental radioactivity; exhaust gas; gamma irradiation; occupational exposure; occupational health; petrochemical industry; pipeline; radioactive contamination; sludge; standard,"Van Netten, C.; Dept. of Hlth.

The Rhine Ruhr area is the largest and most populated urban agglomeration in Germany with about 10 million inhabitants. As a center of coal mining, metal processing and chemical industry the area was highly polluted and environment protection is still an important task for the region. Development of the air pollution in the area. Air pollution has been effectively reduced during the last decades: For most of the important pollutants a reduction of more than 75% could be reached since 1980. The main reasons for that success are: Reduction of the output of metallurgical industry and power plants, substitution of coal by natural gas and oil for domestic firing, closing of blast furnaces and coking plants. Attempts to reduce the traffic derived immissions were partly superimposed by the growth of its volume so that nitrogen oxides several hydrocarbons and soot could not be reduced as effectively as other pollutants. Sources of contamination and site-specific problems. Comparing the immissions at different sites clearly demonstrates the importance of several industrial sources and road traffic for air pollution. At several sites industrial sources still cause severe pollution as can be shown for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene near a coking plant as well as for heavy metals near zink and lead smelting plants (1). Background pollution. Measurements at stations outside highly populated areas indicate that the background pollution is 30 to 80% lower than the immission in the Rhine Ruhr area. A combination of these data with the composition of organic compounds at the different stations can also indicate the sources of pollution, again showing the relatively growing importance of road traffic for air pollution. Deposition of particulate matter and heavy metals. If total suspended matter (TSP) is sampled particles with an aerodynamic diameter up to about 40 μm are collected. Measuring deposition using the Bergerhoff technique also larger particles are cought in the sampling pot. Because the distribution of larger particles in air is less homogenous than that of TSP deposition sampling is the ideal method to identify local sources of air and soil pollution. The most important sources of dust and heavy metals in Duisburg can be shown using this method (2). Cancer risk caused by air pollution. The German ""Länderausschuß für Immissionsschutz"" (state committee for environment protection) established target values for cancerogenous compounds in air in order to maintain the cancer risk below 1:2500 and 1:1000, respectively after a 70 years exposure (3). Even after the strong reduction of air pollution the 1:2500 target values were exceeded in some cases for cadmium, benzo[a]pyene, benzene and soot. First measurements of PM10 give hints about the concentration of fine paniculate matter in the region.",,,"Gladtke, D.; Landesumweltamt Nordrhein Westfalen, Wallneyer Straße 6, D-45133 Essen, Germany",,,09348859,,ZHUME,,English,Zentralbl.

The study is expected to continue for twenty years. The research includes systematic assessment of respiratory disease, injury, and other health outcomes in relation to agricultural, occupational, and environmental exposures. The aims of the environmental surveys are: (1) to conduct a systematic assessment of rural households in order to characterize the environmental exposures associated with the resi-dences and properties of the study subjects comparing farm, rural non-farm, and town households; and (2) to characterize occupational exposures associated with activities of the study subjects, particular-ly those related to farming and the rural environment. The environ-mental surveys consist of a combination of personal interviews, walk-through observations, and measurement of a selected number of environmental parameters. The focus of these assessments is on the environment and operations of the household and farm. Four instruments are used to record data: a Home Environmental Ques-tionnaire; a Home/Grounds Environmental Checklist; a Farm Envi-ronmental Questionnaire; and a Farm Environmental Checklist. Pre-liminary results from the first 106 environmental assessments are described, including the first 26 farms. More than half of residences were built before 1950, and they are primarily heated with liquid propane gas, natural gas, or wood. Dangerously high levels of car-bon monoxide were measured in several homes during winter 1995/96. Only 77 of 148 smoke detectors functioned. Farms ranged from 7 to 1, 600 acres, with a mean of 324 acres. Eleven raised swine in enclosed systems. The average age of tractors in use was 26 years. Twenty-eight percent of all tractors had cabs, 25% had ROPS, and 39% had PTO shields. © 1997 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

First discovered in the early 20th century, oil made the country one of the most prosperous in the Western Hemisphere during the 1970s, during which the government had an expansive program of infrastructure improvement. The oil industry also gave rise to the country's famous steel pan music. However, when oil prices collapsed in the 1980s, Trinidad and Tobago fell into a serious recession from which it has only recently emerged. Much of the hope for the economy now lies in natural gas, a significant amount of which is pumped by Amoco. Fertilizers, chemicals, and sugar are other important exports. In the country's 1990 census, East Indians comprised 40% of the population, slightly larger than the population of African descent. Trinidad and Tobago's population has about doubled since the first postwar census in 1946 and population halfway through 1996 stood at 1.3 million. This relatively modest growth of the population is due to a slowly declining birth rate and some emigration although the country receives some immigrants from neighboring islands. The total fertility rate fell to 2.0 in 1995, lower than replacement level, while infant mortality is low and life expectancy is rising to near that of developed countries. There is concern, however, that the poor economy has made health care and medical supplies less accessible. A 1987 Demographic and Health Survey found 53% of all married women using contraception and 44% using modern methods. The level of use has probably increased since then.

The first scheme used the methane readings from an offside monitor located 1.2 m from the cutting head. This is the typical position of a machine-mounted methano meter. The second scheme used the readings taken at the exhaust location for the machine-mounted dust scrubber. The third scheme used the numerical average of the offside and scrubber readings. The effectiveness of each monitoring scheme was gauged by how well the three monitoring schemes estimated the average face concentration. The average face methane concentration was measured by methane monitors placed near the face. Averaging the offside and scrubber readings provided the best estimate of the average face concentration. Factors affecting monitoring errors were also analyzed. The results show that errors in estimating average face gas levels are influenced primarily by machine position. However, the errors are also affected to a lesser extent by setback distance and airflow. © 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Many patients were referred for medical tests. It is thought that patients with chemical sensitivity have organ abnormalities involving the liver, nervous system (brain, including limbic, peripheral, autonomic), immune system, and porphyrin metabolism, probably reflecting chemical injury to these systems. Laboratory results are not consistent with a psychologic origin of chemical sensitivity. Substantial overlap between chemical sensitivity, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome exists: the latter two conditions often involve chemical sensitivity and may even be the same disorder. Other disorders commonly seen in chemical sensitivity patients include headache (often migraine), chronic fatigue, musculoskeletal aching, chronic respiratory inflammation (rhinitis, sinusitis, laryngitis, asthma), attention deficit, and hyperactivity (affected younger children). Less common disorders include tremor, seizures, and mitral valve prolapse. Patients with these overlapping disorders should be evaluated for chemical sensitivity and excluded from control groups in future research. Agents whose exposures are associated with symptoms and suspected of causing onset of chemical sensitivity with chronic illness include gasoline, kerosene, natural gas, pesticides (especially chlordane and chlorpyrifos), solvents, new carpet and other renovation materials, adhesives/glues, fiberglass, carbonless copy paper, fabric softener, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, carpet shampoos (lauryl sulfate) and other cleaning agents, isocyanates, combustion products (poorly vented gas heaters, overheated batteries), and medications (dinitrochlorobenzene for warts, intranasally packed neosynephrine, prolonged antibiotics, and general anesthesia with petrochemicals). Multiple mechanisms of chemical injury that magnify response to exposures in chemically sensitive patients can include neurogenic inflammation (respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary), kindling and time-dependent sensitization (neurologic), impaired porphyrin metabolism (multiple organs), and immune activation.",Acquired disorders of porphyrin metabolism (or porphyria); Autoimmunity (or autoimmune diseases); Chemically induced; Chronic fatigue syndrome; Fibromyalgia; Immune activation; Multiple chemical sensitivity; Neuropsychological tests; Pesticides; Respiratory inflammation; Solvents; Toxic encephalopathy,"1 chloro 2,4 dinitrobenzene; anesthetic agent; antibiotic agent; chlordane; chlorpyrifos; detergent; formaldehyde; gasoline; glass fiber; glue; glutaraldehyde; isocyanic acid derivative; kerosene; natural gas; pesticide; phenylephrine; solvent; asthma; attention deficit disorder; chronic fatigue syndrome; conference paper; disease association; fatigue; fibromyalgia; headache; human; hyperactivity; immune system; laryngitis; liver; mitral valve prolapse; multiple chemical sensitivity; musculoskeletal disease; nervous system; porphyrin metabolism; priority journal; questionnaire; rhinitis; seizure; sinusitis; symptom; tremor","Ziem, G.1722 Linden Avenue, Baltimore MD 21217, United States",,"Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services",00916765,,EVHPA,9167975.0,English,ENVIRON.

We have investigated whether the use of gas appliances is associated with an increased risk of respiratory symptoms and whether sensitisation to common environmental allergens modifies any such association. Methods: A stratified random sample of 15,000 adults aged 20-44 years, living in three towns in East Anglia, UK, were sent a questionnaire on asthma and hayfever. From those who responded, a random sample of 1,864 were invited to complete an extended questionnaire that included questions on use of gas appliances, to give blood samples for measurements of total IgE and specific IgE to common allergens, and to undergo tests of respiratory function. 659 women and 500 men agreed to an interview. The association of the use of gas appliances with respiratory symptoms, total IgE, specific IgE, and respiratory function was assessed by logistic and multiple regression models. Findings: Women who reported they mainly used gas for cooking had an increased risk of several asthma-like symptoms during the past 12 months including wheeze (odds ratio 2.07 [95% CI 1.41-3.05]), waking with shortness of breath (2.32 [1.25-4.34]), and asthma attacks (2.60 [1.20-5.65]). Gas cooking increased the risk of symptoms more in women who were atopic than in non-atopic women but the difference did not reach significance (p &gt; 0.05). Women who used a gas stove or had an open gas fire had reduced lung function (forced expiratory volume in Is [FEV1]) and increased airways obstruction (FEV1 as a percentage of forced vital capacity) compared with women who did not. These associations were not observed in men. Interpretation: In East Anglia, the use of gas cooking is significantly associated with subjective and objective markers of respiratory morbidity in women but not in men. Women may be more susceptible than men to the products of gas combustion or they may have greater exposure to high concentrations of these products because they cook more frequently than men.",,fuel; immunoglobulin E antibody; natural gas; adult; article; asthma; atopy; cooking; female; forced expiratory volume; hay fever; heating; human; lung function; major clinical study; male; multiple regression; normal human; priority journal; questionnaire; respiratory function; respiratory tract disease; sex difference,"Jarvis, D.; Department of Public Health Medicine, , London SE1 7EH, United Kingdom",,Elsevier B.V.,01406736,,LANCA,8618483.0,English,LANCET,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030020345

It is also a hazard in sewage treatment and manure-containment operations, construction in wetlands, pelt processing, certain types of pulp and paper production, and any situation in which organic material decays or inorganic sulphides exist under reducing conditions. H2S dissociates into free sulphide in the circulation. Sulphide binds to many macromolecules, among them cytochrome oxidase. Although this is undoubtedly an important mechanism of toxicity due to H2S, there may be others. H2S provides little opportunity for escape at high concentrations because of the olfactory paralysis it causes, the steep exposure-response relationships, and the characteristically sudden loss of consciousness it can cause which is colloquially termed 'knockdown.' Other effects may include mucosal irritation, which is associated at lower concentrations with a keratoconjunctivitis called 'gas eye' and at higher concentrations with risk of pulmonary oedema. Chronic central nervous system sequelae may possibly follow repeated knockdowns: this is controversial and the primary effects of H2S may be confounded by anoxia or head trauma.

From the liquid fuels, ethyl alcohol production has been widely researched and implemented. The major obstacle for large scale production of ethanol for fuel is the cost, whereby the substrate represents one of the major cost components. Various scenarios will be presented for a critical assessment of cost distribution for production of ethanol from various substrates by conventional and high rate processes. The paper also focuses on recent advances in the research and application of biotechnological processes and methods for the production of liquid transportation fuels other than ethanol (other oxygenates; diesel fuel extenders and substitutes), as well as gaseous fuels (biogas, methane, reformed syngas). Potential uses of these biofuels are described, along with environmental concerns which accompany them. Emphasis is also put on microalgal lipids as diesel substitute and biogas/methane as a renewable alternative to natural gas. The capturing and use of landfill gases is also mentioned, as well as microbial coal liquefaction. Described is also the construction and performance of microbial fuel cells for the direct high‐efficiency conversion of chemical fuel energy to electricity. Bacterial carbon dioxide recovery is briefly dealt with as an environmental issue associated with the use of fossil energy. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Between 1970 and 1978 in Vienna, the capital of Austria. carbon-monoxide- rich coal gas was replaced with natural gas. Despite this fact, people still die of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning. The main purpose of this study was to determine the reasons for unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths, and further to describe the epidemiology of these fatal poisonings in Vienna between 1984 and 1993. A secondary purpose was to investigate whether intentional carbon monoxide poisoning still plays a role among suicides as was the case up to the 1970s. For this purpose we analyzed carbon monoxide- related deaths in Vienna from 1984 to 1993, based on actual autopsy reports of postmortems performed at the Viennese Institute of Forensic Medicine. Deaths due to fire were excluded. The main reason for unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths in Vienna between 1984 and 1993 was flueless gas- fueled water heating appliances, overused especially by old people during the cold period of the year. The frequency of unintentional carbon monoxide- related deaths in 1993 was almost as high as in 1984. A total of 53% of deceased persons were over age 60. Most fatal carbon monoxide poisoning occurred during the cold period of the year. Suicides decreased significantly during the investigation period. In 76% of these deaths car exhaust fumes were inhaled, especially by men. In conclusion, we recommend programs to prevent unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths. These programs should especially target the elderly. Flueless gas boilers should not be overused. Furthermore, apartments should be aired sufficiently, even during the cold period of the year. Finally, homeowners should have gas appliances checked annually for proper functioning. It would be best to eliminate flueless gas- fueled water heaters as soon as possible.",car exhaust fumes; carbon monoxide; fatal poisoning; forensic science; gas-fueled water heating systems; suicides,carbon monoxide; carboxyhemoglobin; hot water; adult; age; aged; article; Austria; carbon monoxide intoxication; cause of death; female; flue gas; gas; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; suicide,"Risser, D.; Institute of Forensic Medicine, Sensengasse 2, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,00221198,,JFSCA,7782741.0,English,J.

From the liquid fuels, ethyl alcohol production has been widely researched and implemented. The major obstacle for large scale production of ethanol for fuel is the cost, whereby the substrate represents one of the major cost components. Various scenarios will be presented for a critical assessment of cost distribution for production of ethanol from various substrates by conventional and high rate processes. The paper also focuses on recent advances in the research and application of biotechnological processes and methods for the production of liquid transportation fuels other than ethanol (other oxygenates; diesel fuel extenders and substitutes), as well as gaseous fuels (biogas, methane, reformed syngas). Potential uses of these biofuels are described, along with environmental concerns which accompany them. Emphasis is also put on microalgal lipids as diesel substitute and biogas/methane as a renewable alternative to natural gas. The capturing and use of landfill gases is also mentioned, as well as microbial coal liquefaction. Described is also the construction and performance of microbial fuel cells for the direct high-efficiency conversion of chemical fuel energy to electricity. Bacterial carbon dioxide recovery is briefly dealt with as an environmental issue associated with the use of fossil energy. © 1995.",Biogas; Biotechnology; Energy; Ethanol; Fermentation; Fuels; Gaseous fuels; Liquid fuels,alcohol; biogas; fuel; biotechnology; conference paper; cost; energy; fermentation; nonhuman; Bacteria (microorganisms),"Kosaric, N.; Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, Ont.

Methodology: Data were collected from 14124 families with a child aged 4 years 3 months to 5 years of age. This sample represents 73% of the targeted State preschool population. At the time of a routine preschool health check, parents completed a questionnaire regarding: their child's respiratory health and place of residence (postcode), parental smoking, type of fuel used for cooking and heating and method used for home cooling. Results: For preschool children residing in the greater Adelaide region, logistic regression analyses found that having a natural gas stove compared to an electric stove was significantly associated with increased prevalence rates for: (i) asthma (odds ratio [OR] 1.24); (ii) wheezing in the preceding 12 months (OR 1.16); excessive colds (OR 1.14); and hay fever (OR 1.13). The use of a liquid petroleum gas stove compared to an electric stove was not associated with any respiratory symptoms‐ The use of a flueless gas heater compared to other forms of heating was significantly associated with increased prevalence rates for dry cough (OR 1.26), ever having wheezed (OR 1.15) and wheezing in the preceding 12 months (OR 1.18). The use of a wood fire/heater compared to other forms of heating was significantly associated with a reduced prevalence rate for dry cough (OR 0.84) and ever having wheezed (OR 0.82). Parental smoking was significantly associated with increased prevalence rates for bronchitis (OR 1.21) and ever having wheezed (OR 1.24). The form of home cooling used was not associated with prevalence rates, after accounting for geographic location. Socio‐economic status (postcode level) was not generally associated with prevalence rates. Conclusions: These results suggest that respiratory symptom prevalence is related to the fuel used for cooking and heating and parental smoking.

The time trends of concentration levels could, to a certain extent, be attributed to traffic flow modification in the vicinity of the sampling sites, introduction of natural gas in dwellings and degree of energy consumption influenced by the standard of living. Periodograms show a well pronounced seasonal dependence of total suspended particulate matter concentrations, with high concentrations during winters.

Deposition of alkylarsine sulfides near the pressure regulation equipment in the transmission lines may cause serious operational problems. ‘H NMR spectra of CDChsolutions of the pure compounds, trimethylarsine sulfide (TMAS), dimethylethylarsine sulfide (DMEAS) and methyldiethylarsine sulfide (MDEAS) were measured. The signlet resonance of the CH3group bonded to As is well separated in the three compounds: TMAS (1.83 ppm), DMEAS (1.74 ppm) and MDEAS (1.66 ppm). Based on this, a method for the analysis of the pipeline solids has been developed. Analysis of two samples indicate that the pipeline solids have the following composition, DMEAS (42.8 - 46.0%), TMAS (35.4 - 36.3%), MDEAS (4.7 - 10.9%). The identification of the arsenic compounds obtained by the lH NMR method has been confirmed by GC-MS analysis of the pipeline solids.

Special attention is given to elements of the construction and design of buildings which can cause dangerous situations when they are not carefully carried out, such as ducting for fumes, chimneys and escape routes for fumes through the building façade. A similar study has been made of the adverse effects on indoor air quality (IAQ) created when dwellings are renovated without ensuring sufficient ventilation and when electric appliances are replaced by gas appliances for the same purposes. The apparatus considered are those normal ly used in our area of influence: The Basque Country and the adjoining prov inces. The results of the study suggest a need for more effective control by the authorities, legislation with fewer technical loopholes affecting safety and IAQ, and demands for higher quality from the trades and technicians involved in the work.

We hypothesized that under these conditions the breathing pattern may greatly influence the convective respiratory heat loss (Ċr). Ċr values were computed from minute ventilation (V̇E) and inspiratory and expiratory gas temperatures, which were measured in six patients under mechanical ventilation for the management of cranial trauma. In each patient the effects of 11-20 different breathing patterns were investigated. Relationships between Ċr and V̇E and between combined tidal volume and respiratory frequency were obtained by simple and multiple linear regression methods, respectively. Comparison of the standard errors of estimate indicated that multiple linear regression gives the best fit. Thus, Ċr was highly dependent on the breathing pattern and was not related only to V̇E. For the same V̇E value, Ċr was higher when V̇E was achieved with high tidal volume and low respiratory frequency. These data are consistent with previous studies in which thermal exchanges through the upper airways were taxed by hyperventilation of frigid air.",airway cooling; convective respiratory heat loss; humans; mechanical ventilation,"adult; aged; article; artificial ventilation; breathing pattern; breathing rate; clinical article; clinical trial; female; head injury; heat loss; heat transfer; human; hyperventilation; hypothermia; lung minute volume; male; priority journal; tidal volume; water vapor; breathing; physiology; regression analysis; thermoregulation; Adult; Aged; Body Temperature Regulation; Female; Human; Male; Middle Age; Regression Analysis; Respiration; Respiration, Artificial; Tidal Volume","Burnet, H.; URA 1630 CNRS, Bd.

A method of analysis for arsenic which is based on the extraction of the alkylarsines into a saturated solution of potassium peroxydisulfate (PPDS) followed by determination of total arsenic, as AsO4 3-by hydride generation-drc. helium plasma emission spectrometry (HG-DCHPES) is described. The extraction of the alkylarsines was carried out by either shaking 1L gas samples with PPDS or sparging the gas in PPDS solutions. Analytical results of acceptable precision can be obtained using either procedure. Temperature (24°-45°C) or pH (1.10-4.10) had little effect on the As concentrations obtained by the sparging method. The measured arsenic concentrations of natural gas samples stored in Cr-Mo steel cylinders decrease with time of storage (-30% in the first 4 weeks). A standard blend of trimethylarsine in CH4(1 mole TMA in 106moles of CH4), stored in nickel-containing steel cylinder, showed a similar decrease in As concentration with time. The measured arsenic concentrations increase when the temperature of a cylinder of natural gas is heated indicating that part of the alkylarsines may be present in a condensed or physically adsorbed form on the inner walls of the cylinder. Scanning electron microscopy with X-ray microanalysis of the metal powders (Ni, Cr, Mo, Fe) contacted with TMA indicate that arsenic-rich solids also containing C and O are formed in the case of Ni and Cr. This phenomenon may represent an additional factor in the observed decrease in As concentration with time of storage. Polysulfides in solution form (Na2Sx) or solid (Na2S4) can quantitatively remove the trialkylarsines from natural gas. © 1994 Gordon and Breach Science Publishers S.

The aim of the original paper was to outline an approach to such risk assessment. Methods of assessment recommended in 1985 have been improved. This applies to both modelling of flames and marginally to the dispersion of gases. Further with more records of experience with LNG values of frequency of some failure events have changed slightly. However it is shown that the basic features of the original paper remain appropriate and applicable. LNG trade continues to increase. Methods of liquefaction, handling, transportation and evaporation have been developed and improved but there is no fundamental change in technology. The basic method of hazard analysis and risk assessment (HARA) remain unchanged. Attention is drawn to one major development. Since 1985 HARA have become requirements in a number of jurisdictions, while in others they are prominent features in project assessment. In reviewing the original paper it is concluded that the aims and objectives were correct and they remain eminently appropriate.

This paper includes estimate of the methane fluxes from USSR wetlands, fossil fuel mining and cattle, and also their possible geographical distributions. It is shown that the USSR methane sources are 11% of the global value of 540 Tg. Using a simple model of the transformation of soil organic matter, it is estimated that the maximum methane flux from USSR wetlands is 11 Tg/yr. Thus the USSR contributes less than 10-13% of the world's methane flux from wetlands. The estimates of the maximum methane fluxes from coal mining, oil mining and gas mining (including transportation and storage) are 18, 7 and 11 Tg/yr, respectively. Thus the USSR contributes up to 43% of the global fossil fuel source of methane. The upper limit of the methane flux from USSR cattle is 12 Tg which is 15% of the global cattle methane source. It is concluded that geographically there are two maximum values of methane flux from the USSR which are formed by inputs from the different methane sources. The first methane flux maximum is located in the West Siberian Plain and is formed dominantly by gas and oil mining. The second methane flux maximum is located in the Ukraine and neighboring regions, and is formed by coal mining, wetlands and cattle. © 1993.",,fossil fuel; methane; natural gas; organic matter; air pollution; atmospheric dispersion; cattle; coal mining; conference paper; geographic distribution; mining; model; nonhuman; oil industry; soil; storage; ussr; Bos taurus,"Andronova, N.G.; Voeikov Main Geophysical Observatory 7, Karbyshev St. St.-Petersburg, 194018, Russian Federation",,,00456535,,CMSHA,,English,Chemosphere,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027461817

Color ELISA gave positive results in 58, 47, and 5% of the placentas from Xuan Wei women burning smoky coal without and with chimneys, and from Beijing women, respectively. fluorescence ELISA indicated that 46, 65, 56, and 25% of placentas were positive from Xuan Wei women who lived in houses without and with chimneys, Xuan Wei women burning wood, and Beijing controls, respectively. Peripheral WBC samples were positive in 7/9, 8/9, and 3/9 for the Xuan Wei women who lived in houses without and with chimneys and Beijing women, respectively. PAH-DNA adducts were detected in a higher percentage of placentas from Xuan Wei women living in houses exposed to smoky coal or wood emissions than from those of the Beijing controls.

Box 162, 2501 AN The Hague, Netherlands","Recently, the determination of S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) in urine has been proposed as a suitable biomarker for the monitoring of low level exposures to benzene. In the study reported here, the test has been validated in 12 separate studies in chemical manufacturing plants, oil refineries, and natural gas production plants. Parameters studied were the urinary excretion characteristics of S-PMA, the specificity and the sensitivity of the assay, and the relations between exposures to airborne benzene and urinary S-PMA concentrations and between urinary phenol and S-PMA concentrations. The range of exposures to benzene was highest in workers in chemical manufacturing plants and in workers cleaning tanks or installations containing benzene as a component of natural gas condensate. Urinary S-PMA concentrations were measured up to 543 μg/g creatinine. Workers' exposures to benzene were lowest in oil refineries and S-PMA concentrations were comparable with those in smoking or non-smoking control persons (most below the detection limit of 1 to 5 μg/g creatinine). In most workers S-PMA was excreted in a single phase and the highest S-PMA concentrations were at the end of an eight hour shift. The average half life of elimination was 9.0 (SD 4.5) hours (31 workers). Tentatively, in five workers a second phase of elimination was found with an average half life of 45 (SD 4) hours. A strong correlation was found between eight hour exposure to airborne benzene of 1 mg/m3 (0.3 ppm) and higher and urinary S-PMA concentrations in end of shift samples. It was calculated that an eight hour benzene exposure of 3.25 mg/m3 (1 ppm) corresponds to an average S-PMA concentration of 46 μg/g creatinine (95% confidence interval 41-50 μg/g creatinine). A strong correlation was also found between urinary phenol and S-PMA concentrations. At a urinary phenol concentration of 50 mg/g creatinine, corresponding to an eight hour benzene exposure of 32.5 mg/m3 (10 ppm), the average urinary S-PMA concentration was 383 μg/g creatinine. In conclusion, with the current sensitivity of the test, eight hour time weighted average benzene exposures of 1 mg/m3 (0.3 ppm) and higher can be measured.",,benzene; phenylmercapturic acid; unclassified drug; article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test; human; industry; major clinical study; measurement; occupational exposure; occupational toxicology; priority journal; urinalysis,"Van Sittert, N.J.; Shell Internationale Petroleum BV, P.O.

The land Institute near Salina, Kansas is a nonprofit organization devoted to sustainable agriculture. Opinions are provided on the relationship of the Land Institute to sustainable agriculture, the definition of sustainability, the feasibility of replication of his work, his ideas about the destruction wreaked by the plow vs. the sword, technology and population growth, the future farmer, and the speed with which modern science has destroyed the ozone layer. Sustainable agriculture is using the prairie to provide answers to how agriculture can work with nature; the approach will take longer but will sustain both agriculture and people for another 10,000 years. The system runs on sunlight and recycles all materials and is based on the principles of ecosystems, which have been around for hundreds of years. Agricultural technology is based on a fossil fuel intensive infrastructure and is ""parachuted into Third World countries."" ""Corn - the gift of the gods has been the killer of this continent."" 50% of the topsoil has been lost, and soil is more important than oil. Advances in biotechnology are seen as the ""human cleverness"" approach; the preference is for an ecological approach first. Biotechnology tells how to ""spin wheels faster,"" but it also generates more waste. The future farmer is more like the 19th century British naturalist. A projection is that 1st the oil is used up, then the natural gas, and when nuclear power is embraced, Murphy's Law must be repealed. It is important to understand the ""we can'ts"". Realization of limits will direct energy to the sun's potential and recycling and the flow of energy. Descartes' notion of correctable ignorance must be repudiated. Our knowledge-based world has led to acid rain, global warming, the ozone hole, and Chernobyl. It took just 25 years for chlorofluorocarbons to destroy the ozone layer. A philosophical shift in thinking must occur. It is easier to build roads than to think ecologically. Accounting must be considered i the ecological spreadsheet of species survival.

Each subject completed a standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire that contained questions about respiratory symptoms/diseases and risk factors (e.g., type of heating, fuels used for cooking and heating). Cough and asthma were significantly more frequent in men who did not smoke and who did not use natural gas for cooking and heating. Attacks of shortness of breath accompanied by wheeze, wheeze, dyspnea, and cardiovascular conditions in female nonsmokers were associated with use of a stove or forced-air circulation for heating; the type of fuel used did not affect this result. Multiple logistic models, which accounted for independent effects of age, smoking status, pack-years, childhood respiratory illness, education, zone of residence, and work exposure to dusts, chemicals, or fumes, showed significantly increased odds ratios for (a) cough and phlegm in males (associated with bottled gas for cooking), (b) wheeze and shortness of breath with wheeze in females (associated with the use of a stove or forced-air circulation). These results, which confirm our previous observations in an unpolluted rural area of north itlly, indicate that characteristics of the home environment, as assessed by questionnaire, may be linked to mild adverse health effects, i.e., respiratory symptoms, in the general population.

Within the various developmental phases the ongoing improvements in building construction and decrease of the specific demand for room heating can be seen. Parallel to this is the reduction of the annual consumption so that one would presume that the absolute use of energy would also be reduced. If one takes the annual consumption values without considering the various types of energy used in comparison to the values of energy from coal then these values do not follow the development of building construction or the lower specific values shown. Electrical storage heaters necessitate a recalculation in regard to the primary energy used, for, despite adequate building construction and the regulation possibilities this type of heating demands the highest primary energy. If one compares the most inadequate housing in 1950 with single stoveheaters with the lowest energy consuming house in 1990 then both consume almost the same amount of primary energy. Thus, the CO2 emission levels from heating over the winter period are nearly of the same scale in both 1950 with the single stove-heater and in 1990 with the comfort demanding citizen in his detached family house with continous heating and the best technology for room heating and airing. From the CO2 emission levels of the different forms of fuels natural gas has the lowest levels, if the technology of the block type thermal power station with its waste heat utilization of an acceptable scale is available for the detached family house. Besides the development of the smallest unit presented, an absorption gas thermal pump, it ought to be worth aiming for the development of a small unit following the block type thermal power station principle with independent electric generators and waste heat utilization for room heating using natural gas within the next decade.",,carbon dioxide; article; electricity; energy conservation; energy consumption; environmental sanitation; heating; household,,,,01706977,,WUISD,,German,WISS.

Each subject completed an interviewer-administered standardized questionnaire on respiratory symptoms and risk factors. Acceptable maneuvers of forced vital capacity and slope of alveolar plateau of nitrogen were obtained in 96% and 59% of the subjects, respectively. In the houses there were more frequently natural gas for cooking (86%) than bottled gas (14%) and central heating (82%) than stove (18%). As regards passive smoking exposure, 18% of subjects had both parents smoking, 50% had one parent smoking. Significantly higher prevalence rates of wheeze, dyspnea, diagnosis of asthma were found in subjects of both sexes using bottled gas for cooking in comparison to those using natural gas, when also exposed to passive smoking. An insignificant trend towards higher symptom rates was shown by those using stove, instead of central heating. Lung function was affected only in females: those with both parents smoking had reduced forced expirograms, those with bottled gas for cooking or stove for heating had a decreased peak expiratory flow. Interactions of stove and passive smoking on peak expiratory flow and on slope of alveolar plateau were statistically significant. These findings confirm the mild adverse respiratory effects of certain home environment factors shown by other epidemiologic surveys in North Europe and in the USA.

Over time, cast iron and steel pipe sections became weak from corrosion and are subject to failure which in turn can lead to explosions and possible injury and loss of life. Gas utilities maintain system integrity through repair‐replacement programs where pipe sections are prioritized for replacement in any given year through cost‐benefit analysis; however, the total annual amount to be budgeted for replacement is left to engineering judgment. This approach has left some utilities vulnerable to criticism that their current replacement rate on cast iron pipe is not great enough and that public safety is being compromised. This paper addresses the problem situation by formulating a linear programming replacement decision model which augments cost‐benefit analysis with explicit constraints on acceptable risk to human life from fire/explosion.

After separating the condensate, which is processed in condensate fractionation units, the gas is processed through various steps to recover LPG and to reduce its dew point to less than 5°C in order to make it suitable for transportation over long distances. The acid gas recovered during the gas‐sweetening step is processed to obtain sulphur. The major products manufactured at HGPC therefore are lean sweet gas, LPG, NGL, and sulphur. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission awarded the assignment on Hazard Study and Risk Analysis of their Hazira Gas‐Processing Complex (HGPC) to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in association with the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). The scope of this assignment covered a number of closely related and fully defined activities normally encountered in this type of work. Identification of hazards through the most appropriate methods, assigning frequency of occurrence of major unwanted incidents, quantification and assessment of probable damage to plant equipment, environment, human and animal life due to an unexpected event, and evaluation of various methods for reducing risk, together constituted the methodology for this assignment. Detailed recommendations aimed at reducing risk and enhancing reliability of plant and machinery were made. This article gives an overview of the assignment. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

The presence of home dampness and/or molds (that is, damp spots, visible mold or mildew, water damage, and flooding) was reported by 38% of respondents. The prevalence of lower respiratory symptoms (any cough, phlegm, wheeze, or wheeze with dyspnea) was increased among those reporting dampness or mold compared with those not reporting dampness or mold as follows: 38 versus 27% among current smokers, 21 versus 14% among exsmokers, and 19 versus 11% among nonsmokers (all p values < 0.001). This association persisted after adjusting for several sociodemographic variables (including age, sex, and region) and several other exposure variables (including active and passive cigarette smoke, natural gas heating, and wood stoves). The odds ratio between symptoms and dampness was 1.62 (95% confidence interval, 1.48 to 1.78) in the final model chosen.

They are contained in liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas as trace constituents. In our present experiments, we studied the metabolism and toxicity of these n-pentane and isopentane metabolites. Male mice of ICR strain were exposed to about 5% n-pentane for one hour while the oxygen in the environmental air was maintained at about 20%. Then their blood and liver tissue were collected and analyzed by means of GC and GC-MS. The metabolites thus obtained were 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol and 2-pentanone. The same procedure was repeated with isopentane; 3-methyl-2-butanol, 2-methyl-2-butanol and 3-methyl-2-butanone were detected as the resultant metabolites. In the presence of the NADPH-generating system liver microsomes were made to react to the substrate of saturated n-pentane or isopentane aqueous solution at 37°C for one hour. As a result, the same metabolites were produced as obtained in the exposure experiment. It was therefore suggested that n-pentane and isopentane were metabolized chiefly by liver microsomes. Male mice of ICR strain were fed with 80 mg/kg b.w. of phenobarbital for consecutive four days and exposed to n-pentane or isopentane for one hour. This resulted in an increase in the amount of 2-pentanol and 2-pentanone in the n-pentane inhalation and 2-methyl-2-butanol in the isopentane inhalation experiment. The toxicity of each metabolite was studied on cultured cells. The metabolites were individually mixed with HeLa S3 cell suspension, incubated for three days, and their concentration which inhibited the growth of cells by 50% (IGC 50) were compared. It was demonstrated as a result that the IGC 50 for any of the metabolites was lower than that for methanol, ethanol or acetone used as control.",,"isopentane; pentane; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; metabolite; mouse; nonhuman; toxicity testing; Animal; English Abstract; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Pentanes",Japan,,,00471887,,NHOZA,1920919.0,Japanese,JPN.

Prevalence rates of chronic cough in men and dyspnoea in women were significantly higher in association with the use of bottled gas (propane) for cooking instead of natural gas (methane). Chronic cough and phlegm in men and dyspnoea in women were significantly associated with the use of a stove for heating. When combining type of heating and fuel used, in men a trend toward higher prevalence rates of chronic cough and phlegm was shown in those with stove or fan heating (regardless of the fuel); in women the trend reached statistical significance for dyspnoea. The relationship between stove (regardless of fuel) and decrease in forced expirograms was statistically significant only in women. In multiple logistic models, accounting for independent effects of age, smoking, pack-years, parents' smoking, socio-economic status, body mass index, significantly increased odds ratios were found in males for the associations of: bottled gas for cooking with cough (1.66) and dyspnoea (1.81); stove for heating with cough (1.44) and phlegm (1.39); stove fuelled by natural gas and fan or stove fuelled other than by natural gas with cough (1.54 and 1.66). In females, significantly increased odds ratios were found only for dyspnoea when associated with bottled gas for cooking (1.45), stove for heating (1.46), stove fuelled by natural gas (1.58), stove or fan fuelled other than by natural gas (1.73).

US population is 246.1 million and we produce 47 times more goods and services (per capita) than the 1.1 billion people of China. This may be due to overpopulation contributing to diminished resources, food, natural forests, and increased erosion of the soil. Most of the resources we are currently using cannot be renewed after the next 100 years. Land area is diminishing, soil is eroding faster than replacement rates, 3 kcal of fossil fuel is expended to produce 1 kcal of food, natural gas is being depleted, oil supplies are limited to a 16 year supply, and groundwater is used faster than it can be replaced. Pollution (air, water, and soil) threatens these natural resources even more. The US must concentrate on the conversion from fossil fuel energy to solar energy, although much land is needed for solar energy systems. We may be able to increase our solar energy output 3-10 without affecting agriculture, and future fusion techniques may alleviate some of the fossil fuel pressures. Livestock manures could be used as fertilizers more often in order to decrease the waste of oil when synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are used.

It was concluded that in neither sex did the elimination of toxic carbon monoxide in domestic gas, with the introduction of natural gas, result in a lasting reduction of suicide rates.

Among these has been the perception that deaths have occurred more frequently than ought to have been expected. As part of a large field epidemiologic study undertaken during the summer of 1985 to investigate possible health effects in this area, a residential cohort study was carried out to study mortality. The cohort was defined as all those individuals who resided in the area in 1970. A total of 30,175 person-years of risk within Alberta were experienced by this cohort during 1970-84. The deaths during this period were enumerated by resident reports and by manual record linkage with the death records of the Alberta Bureau of Vital Statistics. Age- and sex-standardized mortality ratios, based on expected rates from 2 pre-specified demographically similar, non-metropolitan Southern Alberta populations, were 0.88 and 0.84 respectively, neither of which was significantly different from unity.

Cooking with a natural-gas-fueled stove exposes a home's residents to short-term peaks of nitrogen oxides and to higher average levels of nitrogen oxides than are measured in homes with electric stoves. We have designed a longitudinal study of infants to determine if nitrogen dioxide exposure from cooking stoves increases the incidence or severity of respiratory infections during the first 18 months of life. Pilot investigations for the longitudinal study were conducted from 1984 through 1986. This report provides the results of the pilot investigations. The first study, conducted in 1984 and 1985, was designed to document (1) that appropriate subjects could be recruited; (2) that nitrogen dioxide concentrations in Albuquerque homes were in the range of interest; (3) that an infant's personal exposure to nitrogen dioxide could be estimated; and (4) that a valid, feasible approach for surveillance could be implemented. To accomplish these goals, the families of infants were recruited at two Albuquerque hospitals, and their homes were monitored for nitrogen dioxide using a passive sampling tube. With this approach, we successfully recruited 147 households; monitoring for nitrogen dioxide showed substantially higher levels in homes with gas stoves than in homes with electric stoves, as previously found in other U.S. cities. More detailed investigations in a sample of the homes showed that personal exposures of the infants, who did not attend day care, could be satisfactorily estimated by room concentrations. We also demonstrated that mothers would complete a daily calendar-diary on respiratory symptoms and provide information every two weeks on illnesses occurring since the previous surveillance call. The second pilot study, conducted in 1986, was designed to refine the system for illness surveillance. Additional goals were to test further the methods for exposure assessment and to evaluate recruitment of subjects through pediatric practices. We recruited 75 infants and followed them over a four-month period. Information from the surveillance system was compared with the clinical assessments of the project's nurse practitioner and the subjects' physicians, and with the results of viral cultures. We also evaluated biweekly versus weekly surveillance calls. Overall, the results of the second pilot study documented that a surveillance system for respiratory illness that incorporates calendar-diaries and biweekly telephone calls is a feasible, relatively unbiased, and sensitive method for studying respiratory illness in a large population of infants. We also found that subjects could be successfully recruited through a pediatric practice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,fossil fuel; nitrogen dioxide; article; chemically induced disorder; cohort analysis; cooking; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; human; infant; nursing; nursing assessment; pilot study; respiratory tract infection; United States; Cohort Studies; Cookery; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Humans; Infant; New Mexico; Nitrogen Dioxide; Nursing Assessment; Pilot Projects; Respiratory Tract Infections,"Samet, J.M.",,,10415505,,,2604920.0,English,Res Rep Health Eff Inst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024728970

This has escalated to the point of causing a prominent sociopolitical controversy within the province. As part of a large field epidemiologic study undertaken during the summer of 1985 to investigate possible health effects, a residential cohort study was carried out to study cancer incidence. The cohort was defined as all those individuals who resided in the area in 1970. A total of 30,175 person-years of risk within Alberta were experienced by this cohort from 1970 to 1984. The incidence cancers during this period were enumerated by computerized record linkage with the Alberta Cancer Registry. Age- and sex-standardized incidence ratios, based on expected rates from three prespecified demographically similar, nonmetropolitan Southern Alberta populations, were 1.05, 1.09, and 1.03, respectively, none of which was significantly different from unity.

It is therefore that for standard diets of The Netherlands, Central Europe and the United Kingdom radioactivity intakes are being calculated due to 14C, 40K, 210Pb, 210Po, 226Ra and 238U, the most prominent natural radioisotopes. For 40K potatoes and vegetables may cause an unnecessary burden if over-fertilisation and overconsumption are not avoided. These same dietary constituents control a large part of the average intake of 238U and together with some mineral waters they cause most of the individual surplus ratings. For 226Ra the grain products, and especially the germs in them, constitute most of the daily intake. With special products, like Brazil nuts, important excesses may occur. On the other hand for 226Ra, as well as for 238U, very little radioactivity comes from animal products like meat and milk. This is due to the effective discrimination and speciation patterns of animal metabolism. The isotopes 210Pb and 210Po are contributed by animal and vegetable dietary sources in approximately equal quantities. Only in some sea food products the 210Po contribution may be high, but generally not in fish. Furthermore, a high dose is contributed by drinks like tea and coffee, consequent to the rather long periods under aerosol deposition of growth and treatment. The 14C is remarkable as for the low contents in products with a fossil origin (yeast protein as grown on petroleum and natural gas; some sea foods). A number of choices for food are summed up that may be useful in limiting individual excess consumption of radioactivity and in reducing the population dose. This seems necessary especially for vulnerable groups, like pregnant women, baby's, and other people with relatively large food uptakes, but also for ill people and the aged. Inclusion of the latter is based on recent knowledge of oxidation damage and effective defense systems (like vitamins E and A, and the trace elements Cu, Zn, and Mn in the enzyme superoxide dismustase, and Se in glutathion peroxidase) clearly all sensitive to supply with the food.",,radioisotope; aged; food chain; food contamination; high risk population; human; newborn; radioactivity,,,,,,VOEDA,,English,VOEDING,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024594626

To determine if there was an excess of adverse health outcomes in the population exposed (defined by place of residence), a health survey was undertaken in 1985 in this area and in one unexposed to emissions but demographically similar. Participation was 92% from both the exposed population (n = 2,157) and a representative sample (n = 839) of the main reference population. More respiratory symptoms were reported in the exposed group than in the non-exposed group among those 5 to 13 yrs of age (28% versus 18%) and among never-smokers ≥ 14 yrs of age (35% versus 24%). FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC were similar in both areas. Dichotomizing the level of exposure (high, low) within the exposed area revealed a trend in the high exposure area toward increased respiratory symptoms in the younger age group (39% versus 24%), but decreased symptoms in the older age group (33% versus 36% among never-smokers). FEV1 was similar between the two areas. The excess of respiratory symptoms in the exposed area unassociated with impaired spirometric values would be compatible with increased awareness of health or a small biologic environmental effect.",,hydrogen sulfide; sulfur dioxide; adolescent; adult; air pollution; child; female; human; lung disease; lung function; major clinical study; male; priority journal,,,,00030805,,ARDSB,2923356.0,English,AM.

Natural energy from sun, wind and water has been overcame by more sophisticated resources such as coal, vapour, hydroelectricity, natural gas, petroleum, and, at least, nuclear energy. However all these resources present unwanted effects, namely various hazards to man and environment. On this matter society is quering the risk-benefit balance of some energy choices and optimum performance with new safety means to limit dangerousness are being pursued and developed. It is necessary to evaluate carefully every aspect of safety without under-estimating or over-evaluating problems. For each energy source a ""real price"" has to be paired, even more in the future, since more energy will be required to guarantee the necessary technological progress linked to a better quality of life. In the present review all risks related to different energy sources are described and discussed aiming at defining: 1) specific risks for different sources 2) benefit from their utilization 3) means of defence guaranteeing security for man and environment. Italy is strictly dependent for energy production, which comes for 80% from abroad. An appropriate balance is required considering economical and social factors and real availability of energy. This balance needs therefore to be clearly evaluated hoping in a better future for an alternative energy, less dangerous and more clear, such as that from nuclear fusion.",,economics; energy resource; environmental health; human; nuclear energy; pollution; review; risk; Energy-Generating Resources; English Abstract; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollution; Human; Nuclear Energy; Risk,"Melino, C.",,,11209135,,,2483087.0,Italian,Ann Ig,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024401692

The population numbers 21.7 million. The infant mortality rate, used as a health indicator, is 81/1000 live births. Algeria's gross national product per capita is $2410 (US$15,390). Its main imports are machinery, transport equipment, food, tobacco, and consumer goods. The primary exports include oil, petroleum products, liquified natural gas, wine, and tobacco. Algeria's traditional Berber culture has survived occupation by Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans. The country is made up of an assortment of different social groups and ethnicities, and modern Algeria realized its unitary identity from the anti-colonial struggle. Recent laws allow freedom of association, an indication of growing pluralism in a state where opposition traditionally has been proscribed. 1987 marks the 25th anniversary of Algeria's independence, obtained after a long and bitter war with France. The victory of the Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN) was a signal for French settlers to leave in droves, and much of the country's managerial and technical expertise left with them. Yet, the FLN inherited a sound infrastructure on which to build a modern post-colonial society. Additionally, the country also was to benefit from plentiful hydrocarbon reserves, which guaranteed good foreign exchange earnings. One of the country's goals is to feed itself by investing in a long-neglected agricultural sector, yet presently oil and gas revenues continue to be the driving force behind development. The plans for increasing food production include greater scope for private farmers. A widening gap exists between those who espouse the old values forged by the liberation struggle and a younger generation, for whom the FLN's founding precepts and the leadership's old authoritarian style mean considerably less.",,"Africa; Agricultural Development; agriculture; Algeria; Arab Countries; article; cultural anthropology; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Development Planning; economic development; Economic Factors; economics; Europe; France; French Speaking Africa; infant mortality; Macroeconomic Factors; Mediterranean Countries; Middle East; mortality; Northern Africa; policy; Political Factors; politics; population; population and population related phenomena; population density; population dynamics; population size; war; Western Europe; Africa; Agricultural Development; Algeria; Arab Countries; Culture; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Development Planning; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Europe; France; French Speaking Africa; Infant Mortality; Macroeconomic Factors; Mediterranean Countries; Mortality; Northern Africa; Political Factors; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Size; War; Western Europe; Africa; Africa, Northern; Agriculture; Algeria; Culture; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Europe; France; Infant Mortality; Middle East; Mortality; Politics; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Social Planning; War","Harding, J.",,,03059529,,,12315296.0,English,New Int,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023460453

The country is plagued with military coups, social unrest, debt, poverty, and the disruption of international traffic in illegal drugs. One of the major resources, tin, has been lost as income due to collapse in tin prices in 1985. Other resources include natural gas, zinc, silver, tungsten, coffee, and undeveloped lithium, potassium and borax.

In 1985 the population totaled 10.7 million with an annual growth rate of 0.2%. The infant mortality rate is 20.2/1000 live births; life expectancy is 66 years for men and 73.2 years for women. Hungary was a monarchy for almost 1000 years. Its constitutional parliamentary system preceded, by several centuries, the establishment of such Western-style governments in other East European countries. A communist dictatorship seized power in May/June 1947. The Hungarian uprising of 1956, although forcibly suppressed by Soviet armed intervention, gave impetus to long overdue changes and clearly demonstrated the popular will for national identity and internal reform. With the exception of various small businesses with few employees, all economic activity is run by state-owned enterprises or cooperatives. Agriculture has been collectivized. Hungary has rich bauxite mines and provides for most of its coal and natural gas requirements. Introduction of the ""new economic mechanism"" in 1968 ushered in a period of rapid growth, accompanied by equilibrium in the balance of trade. Yet, in the early 1970s a number of factors combined to blunt the reform effort, and in 1977 government leaders recognized the need for a new reform effort. Hungary is highly dependent on foreign trade, about 50% of which is with other communist countries. Except for the brief and unsuccessful attempt in November 1956 to establish a position and course of neutrality for Hungary, the foreign policy of the Hungarian government has followed closely the Soviet Union since 1947.

Measurements of natural gas (total hydrocarbons), hydrogen sulfide, and carbon monoxide in 16 gas compressor buildings containing 42 compressors (up to 2000 HP each) showed total hydrocarbons to be the critical material requiring additional control by ventilation (primary control is by containment). Ventilation rates were estimated by tracer gas decay (Freon 12®, measured by infra-red analyser), thus hydrocarbon leakage rates could be calculated. Of the compressors studied, 95% had leakage rates below 130 Ipm of natural gas. The principles of dilution ventilation allowed calculation of a recommended ventilation rate which would control natural gas hydrocarbons to less than 1000 ppm, the present health standard, in the majority of the Company's gas compressor buildings (130 m3/min per operating compressor). Results of the study include implementation of a leak detection and maintenance program, a recommendation to seal-weld all threaded pipe fittings (a major source of leakage), and a review by safety advisors of procedures for entry into areas contaminated with gas. Future review of building ventilation requirements will have a documented base to work from, something which was lacking in the past. © 1986 ACGIH.",,,"Drummond, I.; Imperial Oil Limited, 237 - 4 Avenue, S.W., Calgary, AB, T2P OH6, Canada",,,08828032,,,,English,Appl.

An approach to hazard analysis of LNG spills. Journal of Occupational Accidents, 7: 251-272. The extensive demand for fuel gas in modern communities has led to the construction of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and peak-shaving facilities; the latter are often in close proximity to urban areas. Such installations carry with them actual and other perceived hazards; the analysis and control of these hazards are important. In this paper a logical approach to hazard analysis is described and details of the features of the analysis are outlined. A commentary on dispersion models leads to recommendations for the choice of a suitable dispersion model. Combustion and explosion are also considered and limiting features of acceptability are discussed. Part of this discussion is comprised of an evaluation of the adequacy of thermal radiation models from pool fires. Three methods for predicting radiant flux densities that would be received at the property line are examined and compared to those deduced from the Canadian Standard Z276 which is similar to the NFPA Standard 59A. The basis for setting acceptable minimum values for thermal radiation for both pilot and spontaneous ignition of cellulosic materials is also discussed.

Older people commit suicide much more often than younger ones but among the latter the rate is rising considerably faster. More men than women kill themselves but the gap is narrowing. As regards the methods used, there are clear differences between men and women and between the various age groups. Methods have also changed with the passage of time. Since the introduction of natural gas, suicide by means of household gas has virtually disappeared. With increasing numbers of high-rise buildings in the country, suicide by jumping has also increased, as has suicide by lying down on a railway track.

Eleven sites were selected randomly on a grid superimposed on a map of the 240m2 plume and 48 soil samples at depths from 7cm to 150cm were collected. Samples were individually extracted using cyclohexane in a Soxhlet extraction apparatus. Condensed extracts were analyzed using capillary GC and GC/MS techniques to determine quantitatively the dinstribution of C10to C35 hydrocarbons in soil. In solvent extracts of the soils, over 150 organic compounds were resolved and detected at total concentrations from 0.1 to 2700 ppm. The vertical distribution of hydrocarbons was consistent throughout the plume with higher concentrations of all components with increased proximity to the surface. The hydrocarbons moved vertically from the leak and diffused horizontally along an interface created at 15 to 30 cm by the addition 20 years earlier of a dense clay soil to a naturally high-gypsum base. Ratios of soil concentrations in three size ranges for the hydrocarbons were used to evaluate the physical mechanism for gaseous migration and environmental fate of the hydrocarbons. These ratios were not uniform at every site and depth throughout the plume. Results were consistent with differences in mobility and fate of the hydrocarbons in the soil based on volatility and adsorption. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in the natural gas and in the pipeline residue were also found in some but not all soil samples under the conditions of extraction and analyses which were not optimized in the soil-extraction of the aromatic compounds. © 1985, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

One of the reasons is the rather limited data base for hydrocarbon mixing ratios in rural and semi-rural areas. This is—at least partly—due to analytical problems. The mixing ratios of hydrocarbons—except methane—in remote and semi-remote areas are very low, a few ppb or even less. In addition, the hydrocarbon pattern is—especially in semi-rural areas—extremely complex, a potpourri of engine exhaust, refinary emissions, natural gas leakage, biogenic emissions from plants, decaying leaves etc. In the past few years we have developed gas chromatographic technics for the identification and quantification of low and medium molecular weight hydrocarbons outside polluted areas. The results of these measurements show that these non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) are present in the non-urban atmosphere at very low mixing ratios—generally fractions of a ppb, rarely more than 1 ppb. Nevertheless, many of these hydrocarbons are very reactive (rather high rate constants for reaction with OH, some of these hydrocarbons—the alkenes—also react with ozone) and thus are of considerable importance for the chemistry of the atmosphere. In this paper we present atmospheric measurements of some non-methane hydrocarbons in different remote, rural and semi-rural areas. These measurements allow some inferences on the impact of man made hydrocarbons on the chemistry of the atmosphere outside urban and industrialized areas. © 1985, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

During fractionation at processing plants, Radon tends to be concentrated in the Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) product stream. Radon-222 decays into a number of radioactive metallic daughters which can plate out on the interior surfaces of plant machinery. The hazards associated with gamma-emitting short-lived radon daughters have been investigated previously. The present work reports an analysis of the hazards associated with the long-lived daughters; Pb-210, Bi-210, and Po-210. These nuclides do not emit appreciable penetrating radiation, and hence do not represent a hazard as long as they remain on the inside surfaces of equipment. However, when equipment that has had prolonged exposure to an LPG stream is disassembled for repair or routine maintenance, opportunities for exposure to radioactive materials can occur. This paper reports a series of measurements made on an impeller taken from a pump in an LPG facility. Alpha spectroscopy revealed the presence of Po-210, and further measurements showed that the amount on the impeller surface was well above the exempt quantity. Breathing zone measurements made in the course of cleaning the impeller showed that an inhalation exposure equivalent to breathing Po-210 at the Maximum Permissible Concentration (MPC) for 60 hours could be delivered in less than half an hour. It was concluded that maintenence and repair work on LPG and derivitive product stream equipment must be carried out with the realization that a potential radiological health problem exists. Surveys with alpha-sensitive radiation detection instruments and the use of appropriate respirators and protective clothing would alleviate the hazard to personnel working with such equipment.

In 1954 a joint committee report of birth legislation recommended the institution of a family planning system under the aegis of the government. The country's 1980 total fertility rate of 1.9 live births/woman attests to the success of the program. The rate is among the lowest of any developing nation. The population of Barbados was 122,298 at the 1st post emancipation census in 1844. In 1946 the population totaled 193,680. To a considerable extent, this very low rate of growth (0.46%) was due to substantial emigration, first to Trinidad and Guyana and later to countries outside the region such as the UK and more recently the US and Canada. Net emigration was so great between 1881 and 1921 that it exceeded natural increase by 54%. Consequently, the population declined from 182,867 to 156,724. By 1960, the population had reached 232,820, some 40,000 more than in 1946. Since then growth has been slow. Such a remarkably low rate of growth since World War 2 has been accomplished through continued high levels of emigration combined with declining fertility and mortality. The total fertility rate dropped from 4.7 in 1960 to 3.0 in 1970 to 1.9 in 1980. Life expectancy rose from about 50 in 1946 to 70 in 1980. Levels of net emigration have always been high and remain so. About 18,000 more persons left the country than entered it during the 1970s, a rate of 7.5/1000 population. While high, it is lower than in the 1960s. The mainstays of the economy are sugar and tourism. Since independence in 1966, sugar production has fallen steadily in response to depressed world sugar prices as well as increasing production costs. In recent years the government has sought to reduce dependence on the sugar industry. Tourism, adversely affected by the world recession, shows some signs of recovery. The discovery of some petroleum and natural gas may help. Barbados has one of the most developed infrastructures in the Caribbean and the government hopes to deal with current problems through diversification of the economy. As Barbados is the most densely populated country in the hemisphere, specialists agree that even a future population of 300,000 may be beyond the island's capacity. Because of high 1950s fertility, the labor force is expected to increase by 25% by the year 2000, a serious issue considering that current unemployment is already 14.7% After 2015, Barbados will be faced with an ""elderly problem."" Given its current demographic behavior, Barbados is in a better position to address and solve these problems than most developing countries.",,reproduction rate; article; Barbados; birth rate; Central America; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; Development Planning; economic development; Economic Factors; economics; fertility; Fertility Measurements; International Migration; life expectancy; migration; North America; policy; population; population and population related phenomena; population density; population dynamics; population growth; population size; Total Fertility Rate; Western Hemisphere; Americas; Barbados; Birth Rate; Caribbean; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Development Planning; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Fertility Rate; International Migration; Life Expectancy; North America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Population Size; Total Fertility Rate; Americas; Barbados; Birth Rate; Caribbean Region; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Fertility; Life Expectancy; North America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Social Planning,,,,07492448,,,12265967.0,English,Popul Today,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021392412

Data on global fuel production and the chemical composition of these fuels have been re-examined and an attempt has been made to estimate the fraction of fuel which is used in the petrochemicals industry or otherwise not soon oxidized. Available statistics now permit more systematic treatment of natural gas liquids than in earlier calculations. Values used for combustion efficiency and non-fuel use on a global scale still require some estimation and extrapolation from United States data but can be bounded with sufficient precision that they add little uncertainty to the calculation of global CO2 emissions. Data now available permit the computation to be made with confidence that there are no major oversights. The differences from earlier calculations of CO2 emissions are minor, well within the uncertainty limits in the data available. The fundamental problems of assembling a data set on global fuel production limit the utility of striving for too much precision at other steps in the calculation. Annual CO2 emissions retain an uncertainty of 6-10%. Results of the calculations for 1980 through 1982 show decreases from 1979 CO2 emissions. This is the first time since the end of World War II that the emissions have decreased 3 years in succession. During the period following the 1973 escalation of fuel prices, the growth rate of emissions has been less than half what it was during the 1950s and 1960s (1.5%/year since 1973 as opposed to 4.5%/year through the 1950s and 1960s).

Those who stand to benefit from siting a new facility often perceive it as acceptably safe, using expert opinion to defend their argument. Potential losers find data to suggest that the new technology is too hazardous. This paper contrasts the role of risk assessments of low probability events in siting Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminals in the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany. In both cases the decision process was a rather lengthy one due to conflicts between interested stakeholders.

Land is the most basic of natural resources. China's land mass is largely mountainous, with 56% of its more than 2000 counties, 1/3 of its population, 40% of its cultivated land and a majority of its forests, situated in mountainous regions. The quality and the distribution of the various kinds of land are complex and uneven. Although China is rich in forests, grazing, and arable land compared to the rest of the world, its 1 billion population makes the land a limited resource. The limitations of the land are also seen in soil erosion, soil that is increasingly turning into sand, and deforestation. Water resources are not considered scarce, yet compared to the rest of the world, it is limited. Its distribution is very uneven, with more water in the east and west, and less in the north and south. In the southwest mountainous border regions, for instance, water is abundant, but the population and arable land there is such that the demand for water is low. Moreover, droughts and heavy precipitation make the annual water supply unpredicatable. The demand for water becomes increasingly greater as agricultural production develops further, the population increases and as the cities continue to expand. living matter as a resource includes all the animal and plant life that is necessary for livelihood, but only forests and grasslands are discussed here. China's forests, if their use is not abused, can serve as a continuous supply for manufactured products. But its distribution is uneven and sparse. Population control will be ineffective if the forests are not replenished and developed. Grasslands are the primary source for animal products. The natural grasslands, found mainly in the north and west, are not as productive as that of other nations due to the nature of China's topography, the vagaries of climate, and deterioration. Energy, the source for fuel, includes such natural resources as coal, petroleum, natural gas, hydraulic, and solar power. China is among the world's richest in energy resources, yet the supply is sometimes insufficient when spread among 1 billion people.",,Agricultural Development; agriculture; article; Asia; Carrying Capacity; China; developing country; Development Planning; Eastern Asia; economic development; Economic Factors; economics; energy resource; environment; environmental protection; Far East; Land Supply; Macroeconomic Factors; Natural Resources; policy; Rural Development; water supply; Agricultural Development; Asia; Carrying Capacity; China; Developing Countries; Development Planning; Eastern Asia; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Energy Supply; Environment; Land Supply; Macroeconomic Factors; Natural Resources; Rural Development; Water Supply; Agriculture; Asia; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Developing Countries; Economics; Energy-Generating Resources; English Abstract; Environment; Far East; Social Planning; Water Supply,"Lian, Y.",,,10006087,,,12312933.0,Chinese,Renkou Yanjiu,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021114609

This cohort was followed for ten years (1971–1980) and data on 118 deaths were obtained. Five‐year (1973–1977) averages of both St. Louis and United States age‐specific mortality figures were used to create “expected” mortality rates for comparison with the observed deaths in the cohort. Analyses of the cohort were done according to: 1) person‐years contributed during the study period (the “age‐attained” method) and 2) the number of years from commencement of work in the company until the end of the study period (1980) or death (the “latency” method). Using both the “age‐attained” and “latency” methods of analysis, Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were calculated for all causes of death, all malignant neoplasms, and for cardiovascular disease and malignant neoplasms of the respiratory and digestive systems. In no case was the SMR found to be beyond the range of what would be expected in the “standard” populations. While the present study does not contradict the negative findings of the one previous investigation of mortality of gas distribution workers, the limitations of small cohort size, reliance on death certificates and non‐industrial comparison populations make any conclusions at best provisional.

Nevertheless, occupational disability is of great concern to workers. An investigation of disability, defined as permanent retirement due to medical disability, among hourly employees of a natural gas distribution company was undertaken in response to a request by the employees' union. Because of the above limitations, a hypothesis‐generating rather than hypothesis‐testing approach was taken, utilizing both disability retirement incidence rates and a prevalence survey of the living disabled retirees. It was hypothesized from the analysis that this group of workers did experience an excess of retirement disability for the period 1971–1980 when compared to estimated disability incidence rates of the general Social Security insured population, and that this excess may have been due in part to an excess of musculoskeletal disabilities associated with occupational physical stresses and strains.

Respondents’ judgments of the minimum safe distance from each of eight hazardous facilities confirmed that this finding results from perceived risk gradients that differ by facility (e.g., nuclear vs. natural gas power plants) and social group (e.g., chemical engineers vs. environmentalists) but are relatively stable over time. Ratings of the facilities on thirteen perceived risk dimensions were used to determine whether any of the dimensions could explain the distance data. Because the rank order of the facilities with respect to acceptable distance was very similar to the rank order on a number of the perceived risk dimensions, it is difficult to determine which of the latter is the critical determinant of acceptable distance if, indeed, there is only one. There were, however, a number of reversals of rank order that indicate that the respondents had a differentiated view of technological risk. Finally, data from this and other studies were interpreted as suggesting that perceived lack of any other form of personal control over risk exposure may be an important factor in stimulating public opposition to the siting of hazardous facilities.

Wave-powered upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich waters through vertical pipes extending to depths of 100-300 m is indicated as desirable. Technologies are outlined for using the harvested seaweeds to create foods and other valuable products such as animal feeds, fertilizers, fibers, plastics, synthetic natural gas (methane), and alcohol and gasoline fuels. Results from site selection studies and economic analyses are given. It appears that dynamically positioned farms orbiting with the surface current patterns typically found on the ocean will be most cost-effective.

Instrumented impact testing provides dynamic load-time information from which the total energy absorbed in fracturing test specimens (the only parameter directly obtained with a noninstrumented impact machine) can be differentiated into a crack initiation and a crack propagation energy. Other parameters, notably fracture toughness values and dynamic yield strengths, can be measured. One of the acicular ferrite steels had been fully killed and rare-earth-treated, whereas the other was only semi-killed and had a relatively high sulfur content. The semi-killed steel exhibited highly directional properties due to the presence of elongated sulfide inclusions. The variances in composition and microstructure apparently resulted in the significant differences in the crack initiation and propagation energies and fracture toughness values between the two materials. The results were examined in terms of critical crack sizes in flat plate and in a gas pipeline configuration.

A key feature of these problems is that they involve relatively new technologies where there has not been a long history with which to construct a statistical data base. Hence the interested parties will each have different estimates of the probabilities and losses associated with events that affect the environment or safety of the population. The decision‐making process can be characterized as a sequence of decisions, subject to change over time, which are influenced by exogenous factors and new legislation. Each of the separate decisions involves an input phase and an interaction phase. The input phase specifies the relevant alternatives and attributes associated with a particular decision. The interaction phase focuses on the nature of the conflicts between the different parties in evaluating the alternatives. Conflicts are often difficult to resolve because each stakeholder in the process has his own objectives, a limited information base shaped by these objectives and scarce computational resources. We illustrate the above descriptive framework through a case study of the LNG siting process in California. The paper then explores possible ways of improving the input and interaction phases through more structured analyses. Specific attention is given to the role of decision analysis, the analytic hierarchy process, examining assumptions, and the use of interactive computer models for scenario generation. The paper concludes by suggesting future research needs on designing policy instruments for helping to reconcile conflicts between the vying interest parties. Promising areas for more problem‐focused research include the role of insurance and compensation schemes. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell.

Long series of data are available for several stations. The trend in the concentrations is spectacular: the concentrations have fallen from relatively high values to nearly negligible levels. During this period natural gas replaced coal and oil as a fuel for heating buildings. The same, though not complete, changes occurred in the fuels for the production of energy in factories and power stations. The intensity of road traffic has been growing rapidly during the same period. The conclusion can be drawn that modern motor traffic is not a major source of PAH. The relative proportions of different polycyclic hydrocarbons can give a clue for the detection of the kind of source of the PAH-concentrations. This is illustrated by the results of measurements at different stations. It is to be expected that in the not too far future, the relative proportions of the fuels used in The Netherlands will change again.

The appropriateness and inappropriateness of different types of models of accident processes for these systems are discussed. Selectivity biases in defining both die numerator and denominator for accident rates are shown to be important to the size of the estimated rate and these are illustrated by examples. Inferential approaches to estimating a rate based on zero occurrences are briefly discussed.

Uncertainties appear to be extremely large for hydropower which exhibits both large scale ecological impacts and the potential for high consequence, moderate frequency events at specific sites. Major risk-related uncertainties with the use of nuclear fuels include those surrounding nuclear weapons proliferation and reactor accident frequencies and consequences. Uncertainties for coal and oil include specification of the damage function of air transported sulfates and the effects of atmospheric CO2 buildup, acid rain, and groundwater contamination from mine water runoff. Compoundig these problems is the potential impact of the growing global competition for a diminishing supply of oil. In the studies reviewed herein, the assessed risks of the nuclear fuel cycle are no greater than those of the primary alternatives. Prudence suggests that we do not totally reject any particular option at this time on the basis of health effects alone; similarly, no option is an undisputed choice.",,carbon dioxide; coal; hydrocarbon; electric power plant; energy; nuclear energy; prevention; risk factor,,,,00900036,,AJPEA,7270773.0,English,AM.

Its well determinated physicial structure and chemical composition distinguish it from chimney soot. It has not been possible to produce malignancies experimentally with carbon black in any species of animals and with any way of administration. In workers exposed to a high quantity of dust (over 10 mg/m3) features of reticular pneumoconiosis and cases of chronic bronchitis, with respiratory function failure, were observed. Four wide epidemiological investigations could not demonstrate any cancer excess among production workers who were exposed to very high concentration of the black. In spite of this, the carbon black capacity to absorb polyaromatic hydrocarbon suggests that the latter could produce a cancerogenic action. Wide experimental studies demonstrated that this possibility does not exist in reality, in fact the very strong P.A.H. binding to the black particles resists all biological desorption processes.",,carbon black; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; unclassified drug; adverse drug reaction; drug toxicity; ecology; intoxication; occupational exposure; pneumoconiosis; respiratory system; review; rubber industry,,,,03919889,,GIMLD,,Italian,G.

At the same time, in recognition of possible adverse health and ecological consequences of increased coal production and use, the President announced that a special committee would be formed to study this aspect of the National Energy Plan. The Committee held a series of public meetings during November and December 1977 to review a number of special papers on particular problems associated with increased coal utilization. These papers, which were prepared by scientists of the US Environmental Protection Agency; the Department of Energy; the HEW National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; New York University; and Vanderbilt University; provided essential background information for the deliberations of the Committee and were published in EHP Vol. 33, pp. 127-314, 1979. One paper by A.P. Altschuler et al. is published in this volume of EHP. The committee's basic finding was that it is safe to proceed with plans to increase the utilization of coal if the following environmental and safety policies are adhered to: Compliance with Federal and State air, water, and solid waste regulations. Universal adoption and successful operation of best available control technology on new facilities. Compliance with reclamation standards. Compliance with mine health and safety standards. Judicious siting of coal-fired facilities. The Committee concluded that, even with the best mitigation policies, there will be some adverse health and environmental effects from the dramatic increase in coal use. However, these will not impact all regions and individuals uniformly. The Committee identified six major areas of uncertainty and concern requiring further investigation if the nation is to minimize undesirable consequences of increased coal utilization now, and in the future. Two critical health issues of concern are air pollution health effects and coal mine worker health and safety. Two critical environmental issues are global effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and acid fallout. Two additional important issues of concern are trace elements in the environment and reclamation of arid land. Finally, because of the inadequate data and methodology used in the study of these matters, the Committee strongly recommended the establishment of an improved national environmental data collection, modeling and monitoring system.",,carbon dioxide; coal; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; climate; combustion; normal human; prevention; therapy,,,,00916765,,EVHPA,6775943.0,English,ENVIRON.

In common with the United States, significant improvements in sulfur dioxide and particulate pollution have been recorded in a number of cities after the institution of control measures. However, some areas with a concentration of certain industries still have considerable particulate pollution. Since emission of nitrogen dioxide is increasing in the United States, the consequent photochemical pollution in southern Ontario will probably continue to increase. Nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the air are elevated in some western Canadian cities, presumably because of the presence of plants that burn natural gas to generate electricity and increasing pollution from automobiles. There is increasing concern about community air pollution in cities with large metal-fabricating plants, and community exposure to asbestos fibres is likely to be an important concern in the 1980s.",,nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; community care; geographic distribution; industry; particulate matter; short survey; urban hygiene; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Arsenic; Asbestos; Canada; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Sulfur Dioxide,Canada,,,08203946,,CMAJA,445269.0,English,CAN.

Its population was the only sizable one in the country exposed to these smoldering sulfurous culm banks, most of which had persisted for decades. Research into suspected health effects of these culm bank fires and the severe local air pollution to which they added prompted an historical review of their origins and management. Their story begins in the region's geomorphology-highly faulted beds of anthracite unique in the world. It continues through the fortunes of the anthracite industry, which peaked as a major fuel supplier for the nation, then rapidly declined to the status of a minor employer. It concludes with the arduous, now completed, task of mobilizing the political and engineering capability to put out the refractory fires. An account of Scranton's culm bank fires and their control describes the changing human ecology of a region as its prized natural resource and major export is devalued in competition with oil and natural gas. The relationship of industrial settlements to resource distribution, of solid waste to gross industry, of citizens to public nuisances and of technical know-how to legislation are some of the themes of human geography running through the chronicle of this public health hazard. The themes are common: the setting not so. © 1979.",,"coal; air pollution; ecology; fire; waste disposal; Air Pollutants, Environmental; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Coal Mining; Ecology; Fires; Human; Pennsylvania; Refuse Disposal","Shafer, S.; Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program, Columbia UniversityUnited States",,,01608002,,,462219.0,English,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018331999

North-Holland, Haarlem, Netherlands","There is a pronounced relationship between the total interior SO2 emission and the acidification of precipitation in The Netherlands. However, no such relationship can be demonstrated for NO(x) emissions and acidification, probably because more than 40% of NO(x) are emitted at a height of 30 cm above road level, which make it assumable that this part of NO(x) will be absorbed by the direct surroundings. The remaining 60% (170,000 tons) will hardly play a role in acidification. The coming years in the Netherlands will be characterized by a decreasing use of natural gas and an increasing use of oil with this consequence: an increasing emission of SO2. Solar, wind and nuclear energy are unlikely to play a major role in the total generation of energy before 1985, and after 1985 their contribution will hardly be more than about 5% in the year 2000 unless, within a few years, the Dutch Government begins building a number of nuclear power plants. An important alternative source of energy after 1985 is probably the gasification of coal. One expects that in The Netherlands, in 1985, the price of gas obtained by gasification of coal will be competitive with those of the fuels in use today. Summarizing it can be postulated that from now till 1985, with a decreasing share of natural gas, oil will become the main fuel in The Netherlands. In the 1985 to 2000 period it is most probable that oil will remain the main fuel for the first decade, but slowly the gasification of coal (perhaps together with nuclear energy) will become competitive with oil.",,acid; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; geographic distribution; Netherlands; precipitation,,,,,,,,English,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018254242

Proper solutions to these problems can only be given by developing new processes, modifying catalysts and machinery, designing new machinery models, and employing computers for process operation. Environmental control and energy saving remain important subjects in studying use of clean energy sources such as power, LPG, LNG and naphtha especially when their production steps are considered. In view of the recent energy policy, environmental standards will be tighter while energy saving has to continue in the use of oil, natural gas and coal. Besides, new energy sources must be developed. Stockpiling of oil can be a means of energy saving, but the necessary facilities tend to be huge. This demands strict safety measures. A seismic design is being established on the basis of advanced stress analysis. The outcome is indispensable particularly for atomic equipment and structures. Use of oil and coal mixtures has already been started in quite a few places. If oil prices keep going up, coal may be substituted in Japan. Data and facilities for coal will have to be thoroughly reviewed then. Enlarged equipment will need a new design and operation concept in such attempts. The three subjects of energy saving, environmental control and safety measures in Japan are accompanied by many difficultues. The chemical industry in particular attempts to resolve them with technology.

These methods include the determination of the seismic velocity function for a prospect, static and dynamic corrections to the seismic traces, multiple coverage of a prospect and stacking, and deconvolution. The concept of minimum phase, or, what is the same thing, the concept of minimum delay, is defined and it is shown that a positive net down-going energy flow in a layered medium results in minimum-delay down-going wave motion. Seismic migration may be defined as the extrapolation of a wave field from a known boundary at the surface of the earth to an unknown boundary within the earth that depicts the geologic structure. The methods of maximum-convexity migration, and its equivalent, wavefront migration, as well as wave-equa-tion migration, are given. Finally the statistical time-series model used in the method of the predictive deconvolution of seismic traces is presented, and it is shown that the method of predictive deconvolution is a valid method for removing either long-period or short-period reverberations even in the case of a nonminimum-delay source pulse.

The Otto ammonium sulfide process is a typical neutralization process, depending on washing the gas with an ammonia solution to remove H2S. The waste water contains only small amounts of NH3, H2S and other contaminants specific to the plant in use and these can, for the most part, be reused in the process. The Stretford process is suitable for removal of H2S from natural gas, refinery gas, coke oven gas and waste gases from viscose, crude oil and petrochemical industries. It is based on oxidation (multistage) of H2S to elementary sulfur by a sodium carbonate solution containing sodium vanadate and anthraquinone disulfonic acid. The process produces a gas with a H2S concentration less than 2 ppm. The waste waters contain sodium thiosulfate and sodium thiocyanate, which can be removed. The Sidmar Otto process depends on oxidation of the H2S to sulfur by a complex of iron(III) with cyanide. The waste water produced contains sulfur and cyanide compounds which may be removed by burning in a reducing atmosphere (technical scale trials are in progress). The Retu ammonia process depends on absorption of ammonia from waste gas by a weak acid solution of ammonia bisulfite. The ammonia absorbed cannot be regenerated but the ammonia sulfite can be converted to bisulfite. The process involves no production of waste water. The Sidmar Otto process for H2S removal can be combined with the Retu process for ammonia. The USS phosphate process for removal of ammonia is based on absorption on mono ammonium phosphate solution which can be regenerated with the production of the ammonia in liquid form and almost anhydrous. The waste water is under high pressure and can therefore be used in various ways in other units of the coking plant.",,ammonia; hydrogen sulfide; coke oven; gas waste; therapy,,,,,,CHIUA,,German,CHEM.INDUSTR.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0017162105

The economy and efficiency of these motors is discussed. The yearly change and strengthening of worldwide norms for emissions produces a costly uncertainty in the automobile industry, which is exaggerated by fuel shortages. The most important emissions are CO, hydrocarbons, NO(x), and soot. Use of fuel with a low sulfur content, or with certain additives, can improve emmission characteristics. Soot is best reduced by good motor maintenance and adjustment. Other possible methods include earlier ignition, lower compression, turbocharging, and further development of stepped combustion. Motors using natural gas as fuel offer certain advantages over contemporary diesels, but offer less room for improvement, a lower power yield, and higher costs. Another attractive alternative is the 'hybrid' drive vehicle, which has a battery powered electric drive for congested urban areas, while a diesel motor and generator provide power in less congested districts.

However, the study is restricted to routine impacts, including routine accidents whose frequencies can be established from historical data. From the available data, which are thoroughly referenced herein, it is concluded that natural gas incurs minimal environmental- and human-impact costs but remaining supplies are small; oil presents considerably greater environmental and human impacts but substantially less than those from coal, which is both the most serious environmental offender and the most abundant domestic fuel source. Nuclear fuels, which are abundant natural resources, have somewhat less environmental and human impacts than gas. The conventional fuel costs of coal and nuclear fuel cycles are comparable and considerably less expensive than gas or oil, but it appears that the cost of abatement and health and safety measures will significantly increase the cost of energy from coal over that from nuclear fuel.",,Accident prevention; Coal; ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS - Fuels; Environmental protection; Nuclear energy; Electric power generation,,,,00295604,,NUSAA,,,Nucl Saf,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016928302

Hydrogen sulfide is usually removed from the sour gas by absorption in an alkaline solution. The absorbed H2S is removed from the solution by heating it and stripping with a gas. The resultant concentrated H2S gas stream is then typically sent to a modified Claus process facility for conversion to sulfur. The tail gas from the stack containing the unconverted H2S is then typically burned, converting the H2S into SO2 and releasing it to the atmosphere. Sulfur emissions in the form of SO2 or H2S that were acceptable in the past are no longer permitted as various governmental pollution control agencies adopt more stringent standards. This pollution control problem also applies to numerous industrial operations in which H2S is a byproduct. The purpose of this book is to furnish reliable and efficient methods of H2S removal from sour gases, air and liquids.

Of course nuclear energy is considered the mainstay energy source that is expected to play a vital role in overall energy consumption. Solar energy, synthetic natural gas and geothermal energy are also considered promising. Hydrogen is a promising secondary energy that can be used in lieu of existing fossil fuels. Whether these energy sources can be actually tapped depends on progress in technological development. It is therefore necessary to provide a certain period of lead time so that the volume of energy required at a given time may be supplied, i.e., specific dates should be set as they were in the Apollo Project of the U.S. Such an approach is taken in the Sunshine Project now being promoted in Japan. The project was launched in 1974 for the purpose of developing, before 2000, an assortment of new techniques for tapping clean energy sources that remain untapped, including solar energy. This article outlines the overall planning goals for this project. Techniques to be developed include those relating to solar energy, geothermal energy, coal gasification and liquefaction, and hydrogen. These are given priority in the initial stage of the project. As for other techniques, work is to be initiated as required, and includes feasibility studies. At the present stage of the Sunshine Project it is necessary to set the direction of research and development on the basis of current technological forecasts and to incorporate a function that will make it possible, if need be, to make basic changes in the direction thus delineated. A number of tools are available for this purpose. These include, for example, a total energy system, technology assessment, and scientific research management. The research work on the total energy system is designed to study how new energy techniques involving solar energy, geothermal energy, coal gasification and liquefaction, and hydrogen energy are positioned in the energy supply system, and how these techniques are interrelated.

Rats lost weight but survived for this length of time when fed biomass alone. Chronic toxicity was tested in a 5 mth study with diets in which the casein (20% by weight) of the semisynthetic diet was either partially or entirely replaced by the proteinaceous biomass. Rats fed these diets grew more slowly but appeared normal and healthy, and no pathologic changes were observed at autopsy.

A general view of the emission in The Netherlands was made with the help of the collected data. In spite of the increasing total fuel consumption, the marked changes in the fuel type used in The Netherlands resulted, as far as the NOX emission calculated as NO2 is concerned, in a relatively constant emission of approximately 60,000 tons/yr in the years 1968 to 1973. It became clear that the relative NOX emission factors obtained during the examinations are not generally applicable. A comparison with a similar American investigation showed, for instance, that on an average the NOX emission of the natural gas fired boilers operated in The Netherlands is clearly smaller. This is caused by differences in furnace thermal load, in calorific value of the natural gas, and in the excess air. The various factors influencing the formation of NOX in furnaces are discussed on the basis of the results obtained. In particular the formation of fuel NOX in oil and coal fired boilers is illustrated with examples. Finally, the running investigations into the reduction NOX emissions are dealt with. It proved to be possible to decrease the NOX emissions of gas fired boilers considerably by using the staged firing method.",,environmental health; BOILER FIRING - Gas; POWER PLANTS - Boilers; AIR POLLUTION,,,,,,ELTKA,,German,ELEKTROTECHNIEK,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016615104

A second paper deals with field measurements of the nitrogen oxide emissions of mainly industrial installations firing Groningen natural gas. Contrary to what had originally been expected, the gas fired installations proved to emit rather low amounts of nitrogen oxides. It was found that for gas fired installations, varying from hot water heaters in domestic use to industrial installations with a heat input up to 100 MW, the emissions were rather constant, amounting to about 50 g nitrogen oxides (calculated as NO2) per 109 Joule. Larger installations can produce considerably higher quantities of nitrogen oxides. An emission inventory based on the available data is given for The Netherlands.

The synthesis gas can be further processed to anhydrous ammonia using existing technology. During this phase of the project, a 4.1 cm diameter fluidized-bed reactor system was designed, constructed, and operated. Significant yields of synthesis gas were obtained when this system was fed a mixture of manure, air, steam, and a very small stream of carbon dioxide. This synthesis gas was deemed to be compatible with existing ammonia plant technology and suitable for subsequent conversion to anhydrous ammonia. The upper limit of the production rate of this gas was not determined in this study; however, the ammonia equivalent of manure was shown to be in excess of one-half metric ton of ammonia per metric ton of dry, ash-free animal waste.

In practice, therefore, more thorough criteria will have to be applied to the computation of freight rates and larger margins may have to be allowed for to cover the risks involved. Nevertheless, the basic precondition for the use of rivergoing LNG tankers is the delivery of sufficiently large quantities of liquefied natural gas to the Rhine estuary and a continuous turnover (consumption) for the gas at its final destination.

TNO, Delft, Netherlands","Air pollution is defined as any substance in the air which has a negative or damaging effect on human wellbeing. It is not a new problem: historical examples are cited from as early as 1257. Sources of pollution fall into two classes, human and nonhuman. The latter consist of dust, sea salt, volcanic ash, etc. Air pollution of human origin is further divided into radioactive and 'normal'. The sources of the latter are: home heating, public utilities, industry, motor vehicles, and agriculture. These are discussed in order. Home heating is generally done by means of fossil fuels, which, especially if burning is not complete, can be highly polluting. The use of natural gas, a much cleaner fuel, is on the increase. Public utilities include electrical generating stations, garbage incinerators, etc. NO and NO2 are characteristic pollutants from installations of this type. Industrial sources vary too widely for easy summary. Motor vehicles are heavy polluters, especially those using the gasoline engine, which is highly inefficient. Laws are being introduced requiring antipollution devices on automobiles; however, the effect of these devices is to raise burning temperatures in the engine, thus producing greater amounts of NO and NO2. In The Netherlands, greenhouse heating forms a significant source of pollution. Reactions between pollutants occur in the atmosphere; for instance, that between hydrocarbons and nitrous oxide, which results in substances which irritate mucous membranes and damage plants. Dispersion of atmospheric pollution is not yet completely understood, but is in general influenced by temperature lapse rate. Apart from accidents releasing poisonous gases into the air, the day to day effects of heavy air pollution are very detrimental, including increased chances of lung cancer. Also, pollutants which settle on grass may be eaten by grazing animals and thus arrive in the food chain. In measuring pollution, it is not the average level that is important, but rather the intensity of the peaks, and their duration. In conclusion, the legal situation in The Netherlands is summarized, with emphasis on the provisions of the 1972 Air Pollution Law.",,environmental health,,,,,,GIETA,,Dutch,GIETA,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015846541

Cultuurtechn. Waterhuishoud., Wageningen, Netherlands","Hoeks, J., Inst. Cultuurtechn. Waterhuishoud., Wageningen, Netherlands","Injury to the root system of trees by natural gas is a serious problem in the Netherlands. It is estimated that from 60 to 90 per cent of the total annual tree deaths are caused by leakage of natural gas from the older gas mains. Although natural gas itself is non toxic, its presence creates highly unfavourable conditions in the root zone. In the direct vicinity of the leak a completely anaerobic zone is formed because of the combined effect of displacement of oxygen by natural gas and especially consumption of oxygen by microbial activity. Methane is oxidized by bacteria in the methane oxidation zone, where methane meets oxygen from the surrounding normal soil. An appreciable amount or organic matter is accumulated in the vicinity of the leak because of the accumulation of bacterial cells. The accumulation of organic matter and the extent of the anaerobic zone depend on the exchange of gases between soil and atmosphere. Under pavements the exchange is restricted, so less oxygen is available for microbial oxidation of the gas. This in turn increases the region where gas is found and reduces the rate of methane oxidation and consequently the accumulation of organic matter per unit volume of soil. Reduction processes occur near the leak after the onset of anaerobic conditions. The redox potential decreases, so nitrates, manganese, iron and sulfate may be reduced causing a shift in pH. In acid soils the reduction of iron is dominating resulting in a rise in pH. The increase in pH near a leak is shown. In alkali soils a decrease in pH is usually observed because the CO2 carbonate equilibrium is dominating. The soil will be reaerated after repair of the leak. Consequently the reduced components are oxidized and the redox potential increases. These oxidation processes and the microbial decomposition of the accumulated organic matter require much oxygen. It is shown that the rate of oxygen consumption in a gassed soil is much higher than the oxygen consumption rate in the corresponding normal soil. The hatched area in this figure represents the total amount of oxygen required for oxidation and decomposition of the accumulated substances. It is called the oxygen overdemand P(o) of the gassed soil. Obviously the oxygen overdemand of a gassed soil depends on the amount of organic matter accumulated. The oxygen consumption rate was found to decrease exponentially with time. As soon as the oxygen concentration has increased to an acceptable level, replanting of trees may be performed at leakage sites. Laboratory experiments proved that, except for the aeration status, no other undesirable aftereffects of leakage occur at least in sandy soils. The growth of beans was even better in gassed soil because of a higher soil nitrogen content. Probably atmospheric nitrogen has been fixed by nitrogen fixing bacteria (e.g. anaerobic Clostridium spp.) during the gas leakage.",,environmental health,,,,,,LATIA,,Dutch,LANDBOUWK.T.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015782426

Hlth, Topeka, Kans., United States","Latta, B.F., Kansas State Dept. Hlth, Topeka, Kans., United States","The use of wells for the subsurface disposal of wastes has been practiced in Kansas since 1935. All of the early waste disposal wells were used to dispose of oil field brine. Permits for the first industrial waste disposal wells other than oil field wells were issued in 1952. Two state agencies have jurisdiction over the subsurface disposal of oil field wastes in Kansas. Before using a well for the subsurface disposal of oil field or gas field brines, the operator must submit plans and specifications for each disposal well to the Kansas State Corporation Commission. These must be approved by both the State Corporation Commission and the Kansas State Department of Health. The Corporation Commission, through its Oil and Gas Conservation Division, determines that the use of the proposed well will not result in loss or waste of gas or petroleum resources. The Department of Health, through its Oil Field and Subsurface Disposal unit, Division of Environmental Health, determines that use of the proposed well will not result in pollution to the water resources of the state. Before using a well for the subsurface disposal of industrial wastes other than oil field or gas field wastes, an application must be filed with, and a permit issued by, the Kansas State Department of Health. The maximum wellhead pressure that may be used to inject wastes into both classes of wells must be approved by the Department of Health. At present, there are 3,200 approved oil field and gas field saltwater disposal wells in use, receiving a total of about 3.5 million bbl of salt water per day. Not included are 2,550 saltwater repressuring systems in the state which consist of from one to several hundred injection wells. The depths of the oil and gas field disposal wells range from less than 500 ft to about 6,000 ft. Thirty eight zones ranging in age from Late Permian to Precambrian are being used. About 60% of the wells inject wastes into limestone or dolomitic rocks and 25% into sandstones. Lithology of other disposal formations is sandy or gypsiferous shale, salt, anhydrite, conglomerate, and 'granite wash.' Injection pressures being used range from gravity at the wellhead to 0.5 psi/ft of depth to the injection zone. There are 30 industrial waste disposal wells (other than oil or gasfield wells) at 20 plants in the state which include 10 LPG undergroundstorage projects, two salt companies, two petroleum refineries, four natural gas compressor stations, one chemical manufacturing plant, and one fertilizer plant. Most industrial waste being disposed of in the subsurface consists of salt brine, which is introduced into Arbuckle rocks at depths ranging from about 3,000 to 6,000 ft. All wells are constructed so as to preclude any hazard to fresh water. The Department of Health's present policy concerning industrial wastes is that only those wastes that cannot be treated and disposed of by other practical methods will be considered for disposal in the subsurface. Experience with both industrial and oil field disposal wells shows that most operational problems are caused by selection of an injection zone with inadequate permeability, lack of preliminary waste treatment or inadequate treatment, or failure to provide an effective maintenance program.",,environmental health,,,,,,BOOKA,,English,AMER.ASSOC.PETR.GEOL.INC.PUBL.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015773729

An examination of the composition of 27 fine grained coal samples showed that on average 39% of the total sulfur content can be separated by coal preparation. In the flue gas desulfurization, the SO2 in the flue gas is bound to a carbon containing adsorbent and converted into sulfuric acid at temperatures between 100 and 140° C. The regeneration of the adsorbent yields sulfur as the end product. Besides SO2, the adsorbent also binds nitrogen oxides and fine dust. The coal gasification is exemplified by the conversion of coal into a natural gas substitute with the help of waste heat from a high temperature nuclear reactor as heat of reaction.

The methodology presented in this report is a second generation effort developed as an extension of work performed on the environmental impact evaluation of Indian Point 2, a new Consolidated Edison facility on the Hudson River. Indian Point 2 is a 873 MWe pressurized water reactor.The procedure for environmental impact assessment is to perform a ″total″ benefit-cost analysis for the planned installation. This analysis must consider the environmental, social, and economic effects, and attention should be directed toward obtaining a balance among these effects by considering: alternative basic processes, alternative sites, construction impact, operational impact and process modifications to reduce impact. The evaluation of environmental impact, which is more local in scope, is structured around a matrix approach in which the effects of plant operation on the surrounding environmental conditions and components tabulated in a systematic manner. The numerical values for insertion in the matrix are obtained by developing weighted value functions for each category. Illustrative results will be presented for the anticipated operational environmental impact analysis of the Indian Point-2 (IP-2) nuclear power plant, a new Consolidated Edison facility on the Hudson River.",,Nuclear power plants; Environmental engineering; environmental health,"Raines, Gilbert E.",,,,,BOOKA,,English,PROC.INST.ENVIRONM.SCI.,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015696434

Of the cleaning processes discussed in this paper, none results in total removal of sulfur. Mechanical and chemical methods of cleaning coal will, at best, result in only partial removal of pyritic sulfur; itself only a fraction of the total sulfur in coal. In view of the recent forecasts of the potential cost of removing sulfur from flue gases or during combustion, elaborate cleaning or treating methods prior to combustion have little economic potential in the electric power industry except in the case of some established plants where addition of stack devices may not be feasible. Generally, coal preparation prior to combustion would make sense only where the application of a relatively simple and inexpensive method of cleaning would remove sufficient sulfur from the coal to make it an acceptable power plant fuel under terms of local restrictions. Coal gasification does offer the future fuel user a 'clean fuel' - no SO2 and particulates, and reduced nitrogen oxides. However, the future of coal gasification appears to lie in providing, not a replacement for natural gas, but a supplement, as the cost of finding and using natural gas reserves increases. As a long range supplementary source of low sulfur fuel, this method has promise for the future.",,environmental health,,,,,,BOOKA,,English,ANN ARBOR SCI.PUBL.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015695737

Although tail-end gas scrubbing, using limestone as the alkali to control both SO//2 and particulates yielded the highest potential for annual operating cost reductions and would enable use of highly available 3. 0% S coal, system reliability has not been demonstrated. The preferred alternatives are natural gas or, when not available, No. 2 oil until flue gas scrubbing proves practical.Determination of the most economical route to control industrial boiler plant particulate and SO2 emissions for a specific site requires an in depth analysis of the factors applicable to that site. The major factors are fuel cost and availability, how they are expected to vary with time, the confidence in the forecast, and the relative technical risk of pollution control alternative selection. In view of this and the unproven state of flue gas scrubbing technology, this evaluation has resulted in the following conclusions for the specific site, based on many judgment factors as well as economic evaluations. Natural gas and No. 2 oil when gas is not available is the preferred route so long as current price and availability forecasts hold. The most economic alternative on a cash flow basis to natural and No. 2 oil is 0.7% S coal using either bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. However, this is valid only if the fuel price differential between low and high sulfur coal holds as forecast. Further, SO2 control is entirely dependent upon an assumed 10 yr supply of 0.7% S coal. Tail end limestone flue gas scrubbing offers the greatest potential on an annual operating cost basis. However, investment is high and risk is great as system reliability has not been demonstrated. This should be the preferred route because it makes possible the use of our most abundant fuel resource. However, more demonstration of technology is required before the investment risk is reasonable. As a result of this study, the following program has been adopted at the site involved to prepare for the time when natural gas is not an available boiler fuel. Continue with natural gas and No. 2 oil as long as possible. Maintain an ongoing program to determine if flue gas scrubbing is practical.

This is demonstrated by an increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, as well as by increased numbers of different types of bacteria. The resulting deficiency of oxygen, the excess of carbon dioxide, and perhaps the formation of inhibitory amounts of ethylene, are considered to be mainly responsible for the death of trees near natural gas leaks. Also the long period of time needed by the soil to recover, may be due to prolonged microbial activities, as well as to the presence of e. g. ethylene. The present experiments suggest that especially methane-oxidizing bacteria of the Methylosinus trichosporium type were present in predominating numbers and consequently have mainly been responsible for the increased oxygen consumption. However, some fungi oxidizing components of natural gas, including methane and ethane may also have contributed to the increased microbial activities in the soil.

The two main objectives of the present study were to assess the hazards of vapor explosions, and to repeat on larger scale the earlier observations of atmospheric dispersion of the natural gas downwind of a spill. Approximately 12,000 gallons of LNG were used in the various tests; this LNG came from two domestic sources: one in which heavy hydrocarbons were present in very low concentration and which vaporized quietly; one in which the ratio ethane/heavier hydrocarbons was about 10/1 and which provided numerous delayed vapor explosions. No explosion was obtained which duplicated the 1969 experience. The program did not reveal the mechanism of vapor explosions. This failure was mitigated by ingenious advances elsewhere. The program did show that explosions under various experimental conditions did not ignite the flammable vapor cloud and that the energy release is very modest relative to chemical explosions.",,environmental health,,,,,,BOOKA,,English,NAT.TECH.INFO.SERV.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015468781

The concentration of radionuclides is small, but their existence implies that sizable population groups could be exposed. It is prudent to consider the radiation exposures before they occur and, unless they arc clearly insignificant, balance them against the benefit the population would derive from this application of Plowshare technology. The concentrations of tritium and 85Kr at the beginning of production testing were about 700 and 110 pCi/cm3, respectively, and the concentration has decreased exponentially with the quantity of gas removed from the well. Traces of37A and39A, fission product rare gases, and low concentrations of14C(5700 yr half-life) were the only other radionuclides reported to be present in the gas. None of the gas removed from the well has actually entered the production system, but an assessment has been made of the radiation doses to consumers and workers by considering the hypothetical introduction of Gasbuggy gas into the actual gas collection and processing system during production testing. Workers at the Blanco gas processing plant could potentially receive a dose-equivalent to the gonads of 0.3 mrem during the processing of Gasbuggy Gas and could receive as much as 1.3 mrems if gas processed through the plant were used for home heating with non-vented heaters. Both estimates arc for dose received during the lifetime of the well although most of this dose would be received during the first year of gas production. The potential contribution of tritium and85Kr to the general (atmospheric) background has also been considered in areas consuming large quantities of gas, but this is small relative to the potential dose to the individual occupying a space heated home where the combustion products arc not vented properly. © 1972 Health Physics Society.",,"carbon; fossil fuel; krypton; radioisotope; tritium; air pollution; article; gas; health physics; pollution; radiation dose; radiation monitoring; radiation protection; Air Pollution, Radioactive; Carbon Isotopes; Environmental Pollution; Fossil Fuels; Gases; Health Physics; Krypton; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Monitoring; Radiation Protection; Radioisotopes; Tritium",,,,00179078,,,5024728.0,English,Health Phys.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015334771

The presence of carboxyhemoglobin has an adverse effect on the oxygen dissociation curve resulting in a decreased release of oxygen to the tissues. When this is present, along with the progressive decrease in oxygen‐carrying capacity resulting from storage, bank blood will have an even greater loss in ability to provide oxygen to the tissues of a recipient. Carbon monoxide can be displaced from hemoglobin by oxygen when there is room air exchange by donor respiration. The rate of this exchange can be accelerated by taking advantage of the natural gas laws and using a higher concentration of oxygen for respiration or by increasing ventilatory exchange. Volunteers in the present study raised their carboxyhemoglobin levels by heavy smoking and had the rate of decrease in carboxyhemoglobin tested either after breathing pure oxygen or after exercise‐induced hyperventilation. The decreases in carboxyhemoglobin levels were accelerated by either method. Donors who had not smoked showed low carboxyhemoglobin levels which did not decrease after exercise. Thus, blood banks could minimize carboxyhemoglobin levels in collected blood by restricting the smoking of donors, by not collecting blood for at least 2 to 4 hours after smoking, or by using oxygen breathing or exercise‐induced hyperventilation to accelerate the donors excretion of carbon monoxide. 1971 AABB",,carbon monoxide; oxygen; adolescent; adult; article; blood; blood donor; blood gas analysis; blood storage; exercise; human; hyperventilation; male; oxygen therapy; smoking; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Donors; Blood Gas Analysis; Blood Preservation; Carbon Monoxide; Exertion; Human; Hyperventilation; Male; Oxygen; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Smoking,"Shields, C.E.; Blood Transfusion Division, Fort Knox, Kentucky, United States",,,00411132,,,5550714.0,English,Transfusion,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015025969
